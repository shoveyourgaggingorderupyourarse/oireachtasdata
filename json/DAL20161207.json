Jillian McNulty, a 40 year old woman, explained how she spent up to 15 hours in bed before going on Orkambi and illustrated how she is now 19 hours on the campaign trail to get Orkambi made available.  Rachel Byrne's eight year old daughter Beth has cystic fibrosis and has been hospitalised for quite some time but excels in everything she does in academia and education.  She is anxious her daughter gets a chance in life and a chance to contribute effectively to society.  Phil Hughes Dunphy's 23 year old daughter Sarah died as a result of cystic fibrosis.  Her son Shane also has cystic fibrosis and he has climbed Kilimanjaro.

Much is left to be desired in how the situation has been handled on both sides.  The Orkambi drug is effective.  Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, acknowledged this.

This is beginning to move and people are beginning to acknowledge it is an effective drug.  The real issue comes down to price.  We must put in context that Governments do not make drugs, pharmaceutical companies do.<\/p><p>The drugs in question are called \"orphan\" drugs because they are developed to deal with rare diseases but, for decades, big pharmaceutical companies have not invested in developing orphan drugs for rare diseases.  Governments were shy on that front as well and there were numerous attempts at European level to get critical mass behind the idea of developing drugs for rare diseases.  The cystic fibrosis population who might benefit from Orkambi is approximately 500 patients, with 3,000 in the UK, so it is difficult to make back the investment in research and that has to be balanced in the assessment of how to go about this.<\/p> <p> In July the Minister announced drug savings of up to &euro;750 million.  To cut to the chase, I get the sense that there has not actually been intensive negotiations on this.  Deputy Kelleher has had his own meetings and his own discussions with people and one has the sense that it is not being dealt with at a high enough level.  There has been too much spinning and too much leaking, which have caused hurt and devastation to the cystic fibrosis population, and it is time for the bad blood to end.  The Taoiseach has to get a grip on this and on the Minister to make sure there is intensive engagement between the company and the authorities.  If that necessitates international mediation so be it, but something has to be done to break the logjam, the Mexican stand-off that is the current state of play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700003#A00500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481112300,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This is obviously a very sensitive and personal issue for those people who have to meet the challenge of cystic fibrosis.  Vertex is ripping off the taxpayer and I do not agree that there have not been intensive discussions.  I do not agree that there has been an attempt to diminish the impact on quality of life which Orkambi can bring for those patients aged 12 and over who would benefit from it.<\/p>  <p>  It is not a political process that determines the value and the impact of a drug and this has been pointed out by those who are qualified in clinical practice to determine such things on behalf of persons with cystic fibrosis.  It is disappointing that the latest round of discussions between Vertex and the HSE have concluded.  I trust Professor Michael Barry from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, who said last week that it was time for the company to put patients first and to significantly reduce its price.  He said the five-year gross budget impact of reimbursing Orkambi was estimated at more than &euro;390 million and that the centre had noted the significant opportunity cost associated with reimbursing the drug.  That is not a political charge but one that comes from people who are qualified to determine these matters in the medical area.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy seems to be suggesting that the Minister or I should negotiate directly with the company but the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has travelled to Lisbon today and has written to his fellow Ministers in Australia, Canada, England and Scotland, where the medicine has also not been approved.  He is seeking co-operation with these countries and to join forces to impact positively on and influence the manufacturer to accept other innovative pricing approaches to significantly reduce the cost of this medicine.  There are those within the cystic fibrosis community for whom Orkambi does not work and even were Vertex to reduce the cost in line with the assessed proportion for whom it does not work, there would be a significant reduction in the cost of the drug.<\/p>  <p>  Things have moved on from the days when the political process made a determination as to the value of a drug in terms of quality of life.  We all empathise with and understand the sensitivities associated with this but this company is using cystic fibrosis patients.  It has a drug which enhances quality of life but there is a percentage for whom it does not work and the charge being put forward by the company is grossly excessive, as determined not by a political process but by a clinical professor in charge of this who has been very clear about the situation regarding this company.<\/p><p>I urge the company to return to the intensive discussions that have already taken place and reduce the price.

I do not want the Taoiseach to get involved in negotiations.  I want him to ensure proper, intensive negotiations take place.  Since 2012, 32 new cancer drugs have been approved in Ireland.  However, during the past 20 years only two new drugs have been developed for cystic fibrosis.  One is Kalydeco and the other is Orkambi, which has not been approved.  We are not comparing like with like.  Globally, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation offered $75 million to the pharmaceutical world to start developing cystic fibrosis drugs.  The top ten pharmaceutical companies rejected the offer.  Only Vertex took it up.  I am not here to advocate for any company.<\/p>  <p>  The easy thing to do politically is to attack big, bad pharma.  It is great political line.  However, it does not resolve this.  I have spoken to Deputy Billy Kelleher, who has spoken to people on all sides here, and I am not clear that intense negotiations have taken place.  A figure of &euro;30,000 has been thrown out.  Nobody but those who threw the figure out believes &euro;30,000 is a runner for a drug developed for a rare disease.  It could be a bridge to a cure, which must be the ultimate objective of research and development.<\/p>  <p>  I do not think this has been handled well.  It is not good enough that the cystic fibrosis population should read about the outcome of negotiations on the front page of a Sunday newspaper and receive a tweet late on a Saturday night.  This is the context, and there is bad blood.  I did not like what I saw being argued publicly.  A deal cannot be made if there is just hostility and bad blood between the two sides.  That is no basis for resolving it.  There is an issue with a rare disease globally.  We have a huge problem.

As the Taoiseach knows, the island of Ireland has the highest number of people in the world suffering from cystic fibrosis and the largest proportion of families with more than one child who suffers from the condition.  According to Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, it affects around 1,200 adults in the State and citizens here suffer some of the most severe strains of the disease.  There are also 455 citizens with cystic fibrosis in the North.  In the past few weeks Oireachtas Members have heard two heartbreaking and emotional presentations, one hosted by Teachta Louise O'Reilly, made by citizens living with cystic fibrosis and their family members.  We have heard from parents who have buried children and those who manage gruelling daily medical regimes and endure recurrent hospitalisation.  Many of them are battling valiantly to be given the opportunity to access the potentially life-changing drug, Orkambi.  Let us take the case of Finn Whitmarsh whose family members are living in fear that they will not be able to access the treatment that would give him a new quality of life.  For Finn and his parents, Linda and Ronan, drugs like Orkambi have the potential to keep him well and assist in managing his condition.  Finn is two and a half years old and has been hospitalised 38 times.  Cathal Gallagher is nine years old and his health was good until recently.  He has developed lung issues.  The medication he is taking has affected his liver which has been permanently damaged.  He is featured on the #YesOrkambi mural on the quays in Dublin.  Only 40 citizens have been able to secure Orkambi on a trial basis, of whom Jillian McNulty is one.  I asked her how patients were chosen and she said it was the luck of the draw.<\/p>  <p>  I have asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, numerous questions about where the negotiations on Orkambi and other drugs stand, but we are none the wiser, as he has not told us.  The families have requested six times to meet him.  Will the Taoiseach ask him to meet them as a priority?  Some of them were told recently by Vertex that it was open to a risk-sharing model of payment, among other payment schemes.  I am not sure if I heard the Taoiseach properly a moment ago when he appeared to say Vertex was ripping off the taxpayer.  That is what he said.  I checked with my colleague.  It is an extraordinary allegation and begs the question that if he is saying the company is ripping off the taxpayer, what is he doing about it?  Will he confirm if all options have been pursued with Vertex?  I understand the Minister is in Lisbon today.  I agree absolutely that a collaborative approach could lead to significant reductions in prices and commend that approach.  While the Minister in the North, Ms Michelle O'Neill, has no direct responsibility in the matter, she has indicated a willingness to work with the Minister here to assist in the process.  Will the Taoiseach commit to formally approaching counterparts in the Assembly and other EU member states as part of a collaborative discussion to secure access to Orkambi?  Will he tell us what he will do following his allegation that the company is ripping off the taxpayer, while citizen patients suffer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700006#D00100","speaker":"1330"},{"type":"speech","time":1481113200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>Action is already being taken because the drug is not available in the public health systems in Australia, Canada, England and Scotland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700006#D00200","speaker":"1245"},{"type":"speech","time":1481113200,"counter":25,"content":"<p>It is available in Austria.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700006#D00300","speaker":"1224"},{"type":"speech","time":1481113200,"counter":26,"content":"<p>It is true that Ireland has the highest incidence of cystic fibrosis of many countries, if not in the world, but there are those who suffer from cystic fibrosis in other countries also and the drug is not available in their public health systems either.

In his letter he wrote:<\/p><blockquote>Let me give you a couple of examples from personal experience whereby I have been denied my rights:<br \/><br \/>1. Just this morning when I left Donegal to come here I got the bus.  In order to get on that Bus, I had to ask two people to help me on to the Bus as accessible public transport does not exist in Donegal.  This always is a humiliating and embarrassing experience. <br \/><br \/>2. In order to maintain the level of independence I currently have I decided to apply for personal assistance some time ago.  I was subsequently offered 2 hours a week.  This equates to around 17.5 minutes a day.  How I am supposed to use this time in order to maintain my current level of independence, I would be interested to hear your thoughts on [this].<br \/><br \/>3. Despite having a number of excellent qualifications I am still no further forward in being able to find meaningful employment.<\/blockquote><p>To date, Frank has not received a reply from the Taoiseach's office or that of the Minister of State.  His honest account of his life as a person with a disability living in Ireland should be a reminder to us all that for far too long people with disabilities have been left behind in this country.  Frank should not have to feel embarrassed.  It is the Taoiseach who should feel embarrassed because it is his Government that has failed once again to meet the target for ratification by the end of this year.  It has been ten years since Ireland signed the convention, but we remain the only EU country that has yet to ratify it.  This is completely unacceptable.<\/p><p>Will the Taoiseach commit to a specific date by which Ireland will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?  Will he progress the ratification process without delay so that people such as Frank and many others in the country who are living with a disability can live in dignity and on an equal footing to everyone else?  We hear the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health are blaming each other for the failure to ratify the convention by the end of this year.  This is disgraceful carry on considering that every Department in the Government is responsible for seeing this through.  It is a real indication that no real progress has been made to date despite the establishment of an interdepartmental committee on the convention and the drafting of a roadmap to ratification by the Minister for Justice and Equality.<\/p><p>What are the barriers that each Department claims are stalling efforts to ratify?

We have referred to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the House on a number of occasions.  I am sorry that Mr. Larkin did not receive a comprehensive response.  That is probably due to the fact that a number of pieces of legislation have to go through yet.  We take our international obligations seriously and do not ratify such instruments until we can guarantee compliance.  While this convention was signed on 30 March 2007, it has taken all these years to get to a point where we can ratify it.  Other countries have ratified the convention before they have introduced the sectoral legislation that would allow for competence to be evident.  Ireland has not ratified the convention and this is a recurring criticism by the UN as well as domestic civil society and non-governmental organisations.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has advanced the position of those with disabilities beyond that of many other European Union states.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is dealing specifically with this area.  On 21 October 2015, the Government published a roadmap on Ireland's ratification of the convention.<\/p><p>The roadmap outlines the legislative changes to be undertaken to enable us to ratify the convention with competence, along with the estimated timeframes involved.  It indicated a target date for ratification of the end of 2016.  This date was reiterated by the Government when it approved the general scheme of the Bill in March 2016 and again in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p> Three steps are involved.  First, section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 needs to be replaced.  This matter is being addressed in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015, which has completed its passage through the Seanad and Committee Stage of which is scheduled to be taken in the D&aacute;il today.  Second, the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act enacted in 2015 needs to be commenced.  Third, the equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill will address all the remaining issues.  Drafting of that Bill is under way and one particular section is taking up quite a deal of the time of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  The Bill will have to address issues such as the convention's requirement in respect of reasonable accommodation and what is known as the deprivation of liberty.  This matter will be dealt with by a specific amendment on Committee Stage.  The heads of the Bill were recently finalised by the Department of Health.<\/p> <p> The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will not be ratified by the end of the year.  The section causing some difficulty is that which deals with reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty.  A great deal of work is being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, with the assistance and support of the Government.  There has been a deal of serious investment in disability services in the past six months, with an additional &euro;31 million in funding provided.  <\/p> <p> The Minister of State is drafting, with the Minister for Health, provisions on personal assistant hours, which are the focus of the case made by Mr. Larkin.  While the matter will not be concluded by the end of the year, we have almost reached the point at which we can ratify the convention with competence. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700008#F00700","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481114400,"counter":41,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach's explanation will come as cold comfort to the many thousands of people with disabilities across Ireland.

As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, have highlighted the investment over five years of significant money to build community houses rather than congregated settings.

The Taoiseach, being a regular visitor to Killarney, knows the benefits of Killarney to County Kerry and the country.  Credit for this must be given to the great families who have built-up Killarney through the years, including the hoteliers, the O'Callaghan&rsquo;s, the O&rsquo;Donoghue family of the Gleneagle Group and world renowned INEC, the great Liebherr family of the Hotel Europe and Liebherr Cranes Ireland-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700009#G00400","speaker":"1319","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481114700,"counter":45,"content":"<p>And the great Healy-Rae family.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700010#H00200","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1481114700,"counter":46,"content":"<p>-----who provide massive employment in Killarney town, the Randles family of the Muckross Road, Padraig Tracey of the Killarney Park Hotel, the O&rsquo;Donoghue family of the Killarney Towers, the Riordan family of the Castleheights Hotel and the Scally family of the Malton Hotel.  These families have worked with others to build the town of Killarney to what it is today.  As the Taoiseach was informed yesterday, in September 2015, Kerry County Council and Killarney Municipal District appointed Malachy Walsh and Partners, under the stewardship of Ciaran O&rsquo;Callaghan and its director, Mr. Jack O&rsquo;Leary, to carry out the Killarney Town Traffic Model-Traffic Management Study.  The main aim of the study was to review the <\/p>  <p>transportation network and associated demands, with particular attention to the town centre area, with the objective of determining the impact of proposed infrastructural measures to cope with the existing and future vehicular, pedestrian and cyclist traffic volumes.  This report has at its core sustainable transport initiatives, including non-car based travel.  A number of recommendations have been made, including new road links to include an inner relief road linking High Street and New Street via Boreen Na Goun which would reduce peak hour traffic on the Park Road and the Killarney bypass road and a southern outer relief road linking the N22 to the Muckross Road, N71.  This, in my opinion, is of vital importance to Killarney.  It would also, in turn, be of great service to the world famous Gleneagle Hotel and the INEC.  I believe funding for a southern outer relief road should be provided by the Minister and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Another huge issue in Killarney is the lack of car parking.

Where will the accountability rest?  None of these bankers will be held accountable for the taking of hundreds of millions off their customers, wrongly taking homes off their customers and bankrupting them.  This is happening across the board.

In introducing the Bill, I acknowledge the work of a former Member of the House, Ms Anne Ferris, who sought to introduce this abolition in 2014.<\/p><p>Every year workers are forced out of their jobs because of their age.  Irish law currently permits employers to set mandatory retirement ages in their employees' contracts.  There are exceptions in the Bill for those in security-related employment who have special retirement ages already set.  Age should not determine whether someone can do their job.<\/p><p>The Bill is about giving people a choice.  Some might be eager and ready to retire.  Some might need to work past the age of 65 to make up further contributions for their State pension to avoid poverty, while others might simply want to work beyond the age of 65.<\/p><p>An argument brought up repeatedly when it comes to abolishing the mandatory retirement age is that having a mandatory retirement age is necessary to facilitate youth employment.  In reality, evidence suggests that reducing participation of older people in the workforce does not lead to increased employment for young people.  This link has been dismissed by the OECD and the IZA World of Labor report 2014.  If we consider the Bill from a financial perspective alone, financially it makes sense for an older worker to remain in employment, contributing to the Exchequer, instead of receiving payments from it.<\/p><p>A number of organisations have called for the abolition of the mandatory retirement age for many years.  I commend the efforts of Age Action Ireland to highlight this issue and to work towards making it happen.  Public opinion also supports the abolition of mandatory retirement age.

The themes raised included the implications for the economy and trade, the common travel area and relations with the European Union.  I gave an overview of the Government&rsquo;s preparations for Brexit, the all-island civic dialogue and the outcomes of the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p>  <p>  The summit also provided an opportunity for Ministers with particular responsibility for early years policy to consider a collaborative paper prepared by the Council&rsquo;s early years' work sector on the importance of creating strong foundations for children and families to thrive.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, attended the Council on this occasion and gave the Government&rsquo;s perspective in this regard.  <\/p>  <p>  I also had a scheduled bilateral meeting in Cardiff with the First Minister of Scotland, Ms Nicola Sturgeon.  <\/p>  <p>  The Isle of Man was represented at the British-Irish Council by its newly appointed Chief Minister, Mr. Howard Quayle.  Brexit and its implications for all member administrations were discussed at both the most recent summit and the previous extraordinary summit which also took place in Wales.  On these occasions the Chief Minister, Mr. Quayle, and his predecessor, Mr, Allan Bell, set out quite clearly the impacts on the Isle of Man of the UK withdrawal from the European Union.

The relationship of the Crown dependencies and overseas territories such as Gibraltar with the United Kingdom and the European Union is a matter to be handled by these administrations, in consultation with the UK Government or Brussels, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  I last saw the Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May, at the October meeting of the European Council.  While I did not have formal bilateral meetings with her on that occasion, I did talk informally to my counterparts, including the Prime Minister, during the course of discussions and on the margins of the meeting.  When I met the Prime Minister in London in July, we agreed to work together to build on the continuing strength and closeness of the UK-Ireland relationship.  A key priority is to ensure the peace process, including the Good Friday Agreement and the various successor Agreements, is protected in any future arrangement that might emerge from negotiations.  The Government will continue to work closely with the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, as required, to protect the peace process.<\/p>  <p>  The Prime Minister has not mentioned any proposal regarding the UK corporation tax rate to me, although I am aware of such proposals being considered.

With other elements, Ireland's corporation tax rate has been an important and significant element of our industrial policy for more than 30 years in attracting inward investment.  It is something Ireland has sought to protect in international agreements.  It was, for example, attached to the protocol to the Lisbon treaty when the issue was raised during the referendum.  In the first referendum many people who were against the Lisbon treaty and the European Union actually insisted that the corporation tax rate was in jeopardy and that our tax sovereignty could be eroded.<\/p><p>The second time around we negotiated and attached a protocol to the Lisbon treaty, ensuring the corporation tax rate was a matter for Ireland.<\/p> <p> We now face significant competition in this regard.  Northern Ireland is anxious to reduce its corporation tax rate, and had been prior to the Brexit vote.  The United Kingdom is now indicating it could head to 16% or 15%.  The United States, under the new President, is also indicating this.  Does the Government have any plans with regard to these decisions being made by others, which they are entitled to make, and our industrial model for the next ten to 20 years?  Has the Government commissioned any work or research on developing a new enterprise strategy or a new approach, given the fairly fundamental changes that are occurring, not least the Brexit decision itself which represents a fundamental structural change with regard to our economic model?  It will change dramatically the model we have experienced for almost 50 years, since we joined the European Union.  There is a need for fresh thinking in this regard.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach indicated whether the Government has seriously considered developing a new radical approach to enterprise and a strategic approach in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700016#O01500","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481118900,"counter":157,"content":"<p>The meeting of the British Irish Council was the first which the British Prime Minister had the opportunity to attend since she was elevated to the office, and the first since the Brexit referendum, but she did not show up and neither did the senior British Minister put in charge of Brexit, David Davis.  My colleague, the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, rightly in my view criticised Prime Minister May for this, as did the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon.  Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable for the British Prime Minister to miss a meeting of one of the most important forums that exists between all the Governments on the islands?  This was an opportunity, and the Taoiseach is a very regular attender at all these forums, to engage with all the other administrations.<\/p>  <p>  If possible, I would like the D&aacute;il to be given an update on the bilateral meeting the Taoiseach had with First Minister Sturgeon.  The Taoiseach knows the British Government is holding a vote in its Parliament today on triggering Article 50.  Last night, it agreed to publish its plan for leaving the EU before the end of March.  Has the Taoiseach or his officials had any discussions with the British Government in recent days?  I understand the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is in London today to meet British politicians, but I am more concerned to find out the state of play between the senior officials on both sides.  As far as the visit of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is concerned, will the Taoiseach assure us he will press the case for the Government in London to recognise the rights of citizens in the North who voted to remain?  A very particular conundrum will arise.  If the British pull the North out of the European Union, those of us with Irish passports will still have European citizenship.  How do we get the guarantees and the other safeguards that go with this if we are outside the European Union?<\/p>  <p>  I was in Stormont on Monday, and in my constituency and in Belfast there is still quite a lot of concern as the debate goes on.  Even though it is not in the news every day it does not mean people are not concerned about it.  This is the case in Louth, all the Border counties and Belfast.  Many people are justifiably concerned about job losses and the other difficulties which will arise.  Deputy Martin Kenny has told me the only surviving shop in Blacklion, County Cavan, which is the post office, is in danger of closing.  The owners say this is due to the impact of Brexit and the loss of custom.  Here we see a way of life as well as a livelihood being broken down in all this.

The Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, is seeking a special status for Gibraltar, where 96% of the people voted to remain.  He says there is an existential threat to its survival.  It is in favour of the four freedoms, including the free movement of people, because to operate it is dependent on 12,000 people moving in every day.  I understand its official position is to seek a special status to be included in the scope of the European Union treaties without formally being a member.  It is citing the deal and arrangement for Andorra, Lichtenstein and San Marino in this regard.

I have made it clear on many occasions we are supportive of the devolution of authority to the Northern Ireland Executive Assembly to be able to determine itself the question of a reduction in its corporation tax rate, which would approach ours here.  It would make it easier in many ways to be able to speak about the island economy of Ireland.  The First Minister and deputy First Minister are either in China or returning from China.  On these occasions we have always made our diplomatic services available to the First Minister and deputy First Minister for Northern Ireland, in respect of attracting industry and job opportunities.  I may have referred to this in my conversation, but we did not discuss the British Government's intentions or discussions about reducing its tax rates.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Martin is well aware, tax policy at European level is a matter of unanimity but each country has it enshrined in the treaties that it has individual competence in respect of the rate of tax, where ours is at 20%.  The Deputy made a valid point on where we are looking to five, ten or 15 years out.  This is what the essential focus of the European Union should be.  If it becomes obsessed with the question of what might happen to the United Kingdom or what facilities will eventually be negotiated, then Europe itself needs to look to its own laurels and how it should become more competitive than it is that present.  We have always tried at European level to be as competitive as the United States, but we have never been able to measure up to it.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot have a situation where some countries have a youth unemployment rate of between 30% and 50%.  It is a recipe for disaster and leads to frustration, cynicism, anger and extremism.  This is a question of politics and European leaders, countries and Governments must decide politically where they want to be.  When Britain leaves the Union we will still have a Union of 450 million people, a Single Market and a well-developed region that needs to focus on giving these young people opportunities and inspiration.  This can only happen by investment, through political decisions in these areas.  It is a valid point and European leaders need to focus not just on the now but on the time to come so these decisions can be made.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will have noted the comments from Mr. Barnier and from the German chamber of commerce.  I have explained our country's position to Chancellor Merkel, President Hollande, President Tusk, President Juncker and all the other leaders.  This is reflected in many of their comments, in that they understand there is a peace process here, that it is supported by Europe and is something we must continue to support, and that Ireland as a country stands to be the most impacted by the Brexit decision, particularly if it is a hard Brexit which might mean withdrawal from the Single Market and-or from the customs union.<\/p><p>These are issues for discussion and negotiation, which will have to take place.  I do not have any control over the Prime Minister's schedule.  I have attended all of the British-Irish Council meetings of the past few years and the deputy First Minister is now the longest-serving member, having been there for many years.  I made the point that it would add status and importance to the British-Irish Council were the previous Prime Minister, David Cameron, to attend.  He attended one or more of the first meetings but did not go subsequently.  It is an important entity in its own right, along with the crown dependencies.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is in London today and I confirm to Deputy Adams that our officials, under the direction of a section in the Department of the Taoiseach, are in constant negotiation with Northern Ireland officials and with officials in London, as well as in Brussels.<\/p> <p> The common travel area was brought up.  When I met with Prime Minister May we agreed that nobody should lose any benefits from the common travel area and that citizens, and everybody here who has passports when Brexit happens, will be entitled to Irish citizenship and to travel up and down and over and back, not just for social occasions but also for work.  The common travel area has existed since the 1920s and we do not expect or intend to lose it.  When the negotiations are concluded I want to see co-guarantorship, on a continuing basis, of the Good Friday Agreement and its successor agreements.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin asked about Gibraltar but I do not want to put the two things together.  It is an overseas dependency and there is a special circumstance in Ireland, with a land border and a peace process involving direct funds such as peace funds.  We have made the case very strongly at European level and we have to build on that for the future.  We keep in contact with Brussels and are well aware of what is happening with Gibraltar.  We have two people on the task force, set up by Mr. Barnier who is conducting the discussions and will be leading the negotiations when Article 50 is triggered.  We will have an accurate and consistent flow of information which we will bring to the attention of the House at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700017#P00400","speaker":"1245","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committee Meetings","time":1481119500,"counter":161,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700018#Q00200"},{"type":"question","time":1481119500,"counter":162,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[37412\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700018#Q00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of Cabinet committees and the number of meetings held since September 2016.

I ask because of the ongoing crisis in the health services which need constant attention and new policies, although the latter are probably an argument for another day.  I was particularly taken by an interview on \"Morning Ireland\" by a doctor from south Tipperary who described the appalling conditions in south Tipperary hospital as a catastrophe, warning also that all other hospitals in Munster were facing the same difficulties.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and Louth County Hospital in Dundalk have the same problems.  The doctor identified the problem as arising from too many beds being taken out of the system and too many hospitals being closed down.  The Government slashed over 1,500 hospital beds and closed hospitals.  How can one take such capacity out of a system without it having a knock-on effect, particularly with an ageing population?  Today there are 485 citizens on trolleys and 34 patients aged over 70 were left on hospital trolleys for over 24 hours on every day of every week in the past seven months.  We know the story of a 93 year old woman from north Dublin and a 103 year old woman who spent almost 15 hours on a trolley in Tullamore.  Can the Taoiseach give an indication that this committee will meet to deal with this ongoing emergency?<\/p>  <p>  I raise the same issue as regards the justice reform committee.  Yesterday the Government agreed the heads of a Bill on judicial appointments.  The Government's confidence and supply party, the absentionist party known as Fianna F&aacute;il, states it will not support the Government's Bill if the new body is not chaired by the Chief Justice.<\/p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who takes up everybody's portfolio but his own, has demanded and, we are told, received agreement that the new body will be chaired by a layperson and that there will be five other laypersons, making up a majority of the 11 appointments.  This is significantly different from what Fianna F&aacute;il is proposing.  One Fianna F&aacute;il member has described it as a dark day for the partnership Government.  Following this morning's Cabinet meeting, can the Taoiseach provide a firm date for the publication of the judicial appointments Bill and the judicial council Bill?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Bill will fall, given the stated position of his partners, or will they do what they have done so many times in the past, namely, flip-flop on the issue?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700018#Q01000","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481120100,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their questions.

It provided an extra &euro;40 million for winter preparedness and to help alleviate the pressures in a number of our hospitals.

We welcome the fact that the Pope is to visit Ireland.  There is no doubt that 2018 will be a interesting year.  Under previous Pontificates, the writings of certain priests in Ireland were censored by church authorities.  These decisions were made by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.  One of those involved was the world renowned theologian Fr. Sean Fagan who died last July.  Another was Fr. Tony Flannery who was removed from the ministry because he refused to recant the statements he had made in writing with which the church disagreed.  The others include Fr. Brian D'Arcy, Fr.

However, we still have religious discrimination in schools and the church is still not teaching aspects of sex education.  We still have the church vetoing the teaching of religion, beliefs and ethics in schools.  There is church teaching on abortion.  The Taoiseach has said he met the Vatican Prime Minister and the Vatican Foreign Minister.  If Muslims had an all-male state, there would be an outcry in this country.  The idea that they have titles such as \"Prime Minister\" and \"Foreign Minister\" and their own state is something a lot more serious and merits more serious discussion.<\/p>  <p>  I am amazed that the Taoiseach is reporting to the D&aacute;il that he discussed the Citizens' Assembly with the Pope.

A lot of people are saying it is very coincidentlal that the Pope's visit is being planned for 2018, the year in which a referendum on repeal of the eighth amendment is expected to be held, albeit no one is holding his or her breath waiting on the Taoiseach's Government.  Already the Foreign Minister, Archbishop Paul Gallagher, has told the Taoiseach and the world that the result of the referendum on marriage equality was a defeat for humanity.  Are the Pope and the church going to intervene in the referendum in 2018 because if they are, that is serious?  That they would arrange a visit to intervene in a referendum expected to take place in the same year is something about which a lot of people have questions.  If it is a private visit to attend the world meeting of families, why was it announced after the Taoiseach's visit?  Why would the church not just announce it without the Taoiseach having to go over and without having a ceremonial event?  It was only then that it was announced.

These services are regulated by the National Transport Authority, NTA,\u00a0under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  There have been instances in recent years whereby some commercial services have been reconfigured\u00a0leaving certain areas without the desired level of public transport provision.  In \u00a0response,\u00a0the NTA has\u00a0used its powers under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 to ensure continued public transport services through the provision of\u00a0subvented public service obligation, PSO,\u00a0services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700021#T01200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1481121300,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I offer the Minister my apologies.

As the Deputy is aware, Smarter Travel: a New Transport Policy for Ireland 2009-2020, was launched in January 2009.  The targets set out in that policy\u00a0were broad and ambitious.  As it turns out, they were over-ambitious. \u00a0The goal of the policy was to reduce private car use by increasing the number of people who walk, cycle or use public transport. \u00a0Implementation of the\u00a0policy was to result in\u00a0reduced congestion\u00a0and\u00a0contribute to Ireland's international obligations to reduce carbon and other emissions and contribute to improving\u00a0public health and quality of life.\u00a0<\/p><p>\u200bThe targets set out in the\u00a0smarter travel policy\u00a0were predicated on significant investment of &euro;4.5 billion.  This was in addition to the\u00a0then approved\u00a0Transport 21 investment programme.\u00a0 As the Deputy is aware, owing to the economic and fiscal crises, there was a significant and necessary\u00a0scaling back of investment, with many projects in the transport area cancelled or deferred, and it\u00a0has\u00a0not been\u00a0possible to direct\u00a0the funding originally anticipated\u00a0towards implementing the 49 actions contained in the smarter travel policy.  I regret that.  Nevertheless, the overarching goals contained in smarter travel\u00a0remain the cornerstone of our\u00a0transport policy. \u00a0This is recognised and reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government in which we commit\u00a0to ensuring that the &euro;3.6 billion investment in the\u00a0public transport system provided for in\u00a0the capital plan will uphold the\u00a0principles of\u00a0the smarter travel policy<i>.  <\/i>The capital plan also specifically commits &euro;100 million in funding for\u00a0smarter travel and carbon reduction measures.<\/p><p>Progress has been made and continues to be made in encouraging people to use public transport and more sustainable forms of transport.  For example, we have seen a significant increase in cycling in Dublin with\u00a0steady year-on-year growth, with an increase of more than 125% between 2006 and 2015.

Many people have reached the stage where they cannot get a quote.  It is impossible and they are being priced out of the market.  Given that it is a legal requirement to have motor insurance, the increases put people in a very difficult set of circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance companies state fraud is a major issue in the sector.  Perhaps it is - I am sure there is an element of it - but if the companies claim fraudulent claims result in an increase in insurance premiums in the order of &euro;50, it does not go anywhere near explaining the huge increases, sometimes in the order of 200% or 300%.  Will the Minister consider having or support some kind of public nationalised insurance scheme for vehicles, given that having motor insurance is a legal obligation?<\/p><p>At the same time, we leave the entire matter in the hands of the private market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700025#X01100","speaker":"1333","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481124300,"counter":264,"content":"<p>We have exceeded the-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700026#Y00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1481124300,"counter":265,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give support for this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700026#Y00300","speaker":"1333"},{"type":"speech","time":1481124300,"counter":266,"content":"<p>We have to stick to the minute.

We also have very noisy aircraft from Ethiopian Airlines.  There are no noise limits, night time quotas or auxiliary power unit bans.  All those are mechanisms whereby the Minister could intervene, as the Minister responsible for the authority, and say that is not good environmental practice and it is intruding on the neighbours.

It is a massive and further inconvenience for the residents who have had an intolerable time in terms of noise.

It should tell us that it is not enough to be advertising aggressively in the newspapers and on television.  That does not work on its own, the figures are so bad.

The enforcement actions of the road safety strategy are hopelessly behind target.

I remember well the traditional view in west Cork when the farmers' markets originally came to Clonakilty and Skibbereen and towns like that, there was a kind of resistance towards the markets from the established traders.  There was a view that the markets were not contributing anything to society and they were making their way on the backs of others.  As the passage of time has evolved there is now a significant shift in attitude towards how people view farmers' markets.  We need only look at the thousands of people who go to farmers' markets every week and who wish to purchase produce that is produced locally, on a small scale or at home.  In many Irish towns the farmers' markets are supported by the existing town traders because the traders are delighted with the footfall brought by farmer's markets in to towns facing the increasing challenge of desertion due to online trading.  If we are to be serious as a Government and a State we must acknowledge this development and movement.  We must do more than just give a nod to this trend.<\/p>  <p>  We have to recognise the enormous value attached to the burgeoning and blossoming trade of farmers' markets.  On top of that, it is now a huge social event every week in rural towns such as Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bandon and my own bailiwick of Kinsale.  Nothing has really replaced - in any of these towns - the social event that was centred around the creamery.  Many of my generation and older will remember attending the local creamery.  While we refer to schools as social hubs there really is not a social life to the school yard.  We come in our cars, we drop our children off and we move on again.  In this context there is a lot to be said about rural isolation and the social aspect attached to farmers' markets.<\/p><p>Many people produce goods at home to make a living for themselves and their families and sell their wares at farmers' markets which are a massive tourist draw.  We need only look anywhere on the Continent to see how enormously successful farmers' markets are.  It is also the case in Ireland and it is high time we did a little more than pay lip service to them.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which is in charge of the promotion of food products needs to think outside the box.  The Minister and his officials need to acknowledge the phenomenon that is the country market.  I would like to see a funding stream provided for local authorities, in my case Cork County Council, to allow them provide hard-stand areas for farmers' markets, including a concrete channel.  Instead of being choked by generator fumes, a system could be put in place, with outlets which could be charged using existing pay-as-you-go systems.  Running water could also be made available.  Awnings could be placed over the hard-stand areas to protect not only the traders but also the thousands of customers who like to visit the markets and purchase the produce on sale.  This would take a little thinking outside the box.  The Department provides funding through a number of agencies, but we need to up our game and move into the next sphere.  We need to recognise the phenomenon farmers' markets are and their success and put our money where our mouths are and provide real funding to provide the genuine hardware associated with these events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700030#CC02000","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481127300,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  Any of us who has had the privilege and opportunity to travel abroad has seen, particularly in continental Europe, the potential of farmers' markets.  The Deputy referred to the colour and vibrancy they bring to local towns.  We are blessed to have a network of old market towns.  Unfortunately, many of them have fallen victim to recent shopping trends, with supermarkets on the outskirts sucking life from their centres.  Many of them are adorned with fabulous old squares which, once upon a time, were thriving marketplaces and which in recent years have become glorified car parks.  There is an opportunity, in the context of the points made by the Deputy, to reinvigorate them, including through the provision of appropriate infrastructure to support country and farmers' markets.<\/p>  <p>  It is no coincidence that the proposal comes from the constituency of Cork South West which adjoins mine and where there is a very strong tradition of engaging in artisan food production and a real emphasis on food provenance.  I would certainly see the proposal as beneficial.  Support for farmers' markets is provided by the Department through the CEDRA rural innovation and development fund.  I have assigned a portion of the &euro;1.5 million allocation in 2016 to agrifood tourism projects in rural Ireland.  They include local farmer, food and artisan market schemes that support local and seasonal food production and artisan crafts.  In this regard, the Department recently awarded funding of &euro;445,000 through 13 separate agrifood tourism initiatives developed by local authorities in rural areas following a competitive process under the CEDRA rural innovation and development fund.  These awards are managed by the local authorities, with a view to targeting specific supports relevant for local area development strategies.  In general, the initiatives under the CEDRA rural innovation and development fund aim to energise the rural economy and, in particular, provide support for agrifood tourism projects which may assist rural communities which have taken steps to establish a local rural market to progress to opening stage or to facilitate established local rural markets to develop and maximise their potential and expand.  The rural innovation and development fund will continue in 2017 and it is my intention that agrifood tourism will remain a key theme.  I will reflect on the specifics of the Deputy's contribution in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Support for local markets is also provided through the departmental agency Bord Bia, with the provision of information assistance and publicity via its website for local food, country and farmers' markets.  It includes a list of farmers in country markets and a guide to food markets in Ireland.  Furthermore, recognising the need to assist small Irish food and drink start-up producers and traders in developing their market produce and brands, the support of skills and best practice for market organisers is also provided by Bord Bia.  One such scheme is the voluntary good practice standard for farmers' markets that promotes good market governance and food safety and labelling compliance, while at the same time encouraging regular farmers' markets to be held in local communities that stock a substantial proportion of locally produced seasonal produce.<\/p>  <p>  A new and important support initiative to support farmers' and country markets which starts in November is a series of regional workshops designed by Bord Bia to help stall holders to sell better at farmers' markets.  The workshops aim to give practical solutions to challenges that all market sellers may encounter.  They cover key areas of the market business and provide an opportunity for existing and prospective producers to network and share their experiences.  Funding is also available through the Leader programme which in the next five to six years will have &euro;250 million available for rural communities and represents 7% of the rural development programme budget during the period.  Local authorities have some community support grants which may be of benefit to the type of project the Deputy is advocating.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700031#DD00200","speaker":"1285"},{"type":"speech","time":1481127300,"counter":364,"content":"<p>People in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency of Donegal, the Minister's constituency of Cork North West and my constituency of Cork South West have a particular appreciation, as most people do, that, despite the availability of shops such as Argos, Amazon and IKEA, there is nothing akin to visiting a house or calling to see somebody and being given something home made when leaving, whether it be a pot of jam, a loaf of bread or a cake.  It is this experience people the length and breadth of the country crave and they chase it by coming to these markets.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister outlined, I come from an area where there is a very strong and proud tradition of food production in the towns I have the honour to represent.  That is why the markets are so popular in my area, as they are everywhere else and, as the Minister acknowledged, throughout the Continent.  In fairness, Cork County Council acknowledges this and is making an effort.  It is taking public submissions in setting new by-laws and regulations, but there is always a big health warning attached to regulations because there is a danger that we will overregulate the golden goose which is laying the egg and choke it out of existence.  A very small producer of pots of jam could be wiped out by unnecessary bureaucracy.  Therefore, we have to be very careful on this level.  While I acknowledge the Minister's response and thank him for it and the existing funding, I ask him to accept the premise of what I am saying, that we need to move beyond giving assistance to the promotion of the markets.  We need to provide proper infrastructure to take full advantage of this fantastic asset and the value they bring to those who use them, the traders who sell their produce and tourists, as well as of the social vibrancy generated in the heart of towns.  We all pay lip service every day of the week to the issues we would like to address, including mental well-being.  This would be a very practical step to take and I hope the Minister will support me in my endeavours.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700031#DD00300","speaker":"1261"},{"type":"speech","time":1481127300,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I will reflect on the points the Deputy has made in the context of the budget that is available for 2017.

They include the provision of street furniture, awnings to provide shelter not only for stall holders but also customers, as well as water and electricity on site instead of being poisoned by fumes from generators.  All of these issues can be progressed through the grants scheme in conjunction with local authorities.  If it is the case that we need to tweak or redefine the scope of what is assisted under the CEDRA rural innovation and development fund to enable this to happen, I am certainly prepared to look at the matter in the Department.  It is a relatively modest fund, but in conjunction with local funding it might be possible to deliver on the Deputy's objective.  It would be a service to the food sector.

I understand that he is to come to Limerick on Friday to launch a review of the regeneration programme and the annual review of Novas Initiatives.  The issue I am raising has been prompted by people who work in services in Limerick, both in the council and in the emergency services.  They are deeply concerned that no accommodation will be available to house homeless families in the city over the Christmas period.  My constituency office is inundated on a daily basis by families with young children who have nowhere to go.  At the moment we are able to accommodate them in emergency accommodation but the crisis arises because we have been told that no accommodation is available over the Christmas period due to a number of factors, one being that a number of bed and breakfasts and hotels which offer emergency accommodation will not be open over the Christmas period.  I ask the Minister to intervene personally in this situation because it is unprecedented in Limerick, at least as far as I am aware.  Most of the properties in which families have been accommodated to date will be closed over the Christmas period.  I have a list if the Minister wants me to give it to him.<\/p>  <p>  Council members and people who work in homeless services are under huge pressure and I commend them on the work they do in this very difficult housing situation.  It seems to be getting worse day by day and since this time last year the crisis has become unmanageable.  Christmas is coming and there is no room at the inn for many of these families.  We are approaching the end of the 1916 centenary year and it is simply not acceptable that families are facing Christmas not knowing whether they will have a home for themselves and their children.<\/p>  <p>  On 25 November Limerick City Council confirmed to me that there were 197 individual residents in homeless accommodation, of which 57 were young children.  Emergency accommodation in Limerick often includes a variety of properties, hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and temporary accommodation.  My understanding is that no accommodation is available to meet the need, especially over the holidays and particularly on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.  Christmas is a time for celebration and joy and we have deep concern that some of these families will be unable to access accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Because of this emergency situation I call for the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, to intervene personally to ensure that no family in Limerick will be without a roof over its head over the holiday period.  This desperate situation places huge pressure on providers of emergency accommodation.  Those who work in these services are already overstressed by having to work in an environment with scarce resources in the middle of a severe housing crisis and a national emergency.  I ask the Minister to think of the families, the mothers and fathers who have sleepless nights worrying over whether their children will have a bed and security over the Christmas period.  It is an appalling indictment of all of us in this House that this is what we, as a society, have come to - a State that cannot and will not house its own children.  Professional service providers in Limerick who contact me over this issue are very stressed and worried.  They are deeply concerned that there simply will not be enough accommodation to house people over the festive period.  On their behalf and on behalf of the homeless families I ask the Minister to intervene personally in this issue to ensure that, at the very least, families have a place to stay over Christmas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700032#EE00300","speaker":"1327"},{"type":"speech","time":1481127900,"counter":369,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and keeping homelessness in focus.  This is priority No. 1 for the Minister, the Department and me and we are working directly and together on it.  The Minister is not in the House today but he is very much aware of the situation in Limerick and has been there a couple of times since we launched Rebuilding Ireland.  We also had a stakeholder event there recently.  I have been there too because it is the priority for the Department and for Government.  The Deputy is right that the number of people in emergency accommodation is unsatisfactory and not acceptable and we are trying to address the problem.  The Deputy may rest assured of the commitment of the Minister on this.<\/p>  <p>  At the outset let me be clear, my Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level.  Statutory responsibility for the provision of homeless services, including accommodation, rests with individual housing authorities.  All housing authorities have wide and flexible statutory powers to assist in or make arrangements for the accommodation of homeless persons.  This means that operational issues, such as those raised by the Deputy today, are a matter for the relevant housing authority, in this case Limerick City and County Council.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is fully committed to addressing the issue of homelessness.  Under this Government there has been a focused and co-ordinated approach to tackling homelessness across Government Departments and agencies.  The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes.  A range of measures is being progressed in this regard.  Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which was launched in July 2016, provides a multi-stranded, action-oriented approach to achieving the Government's key housing objectives.  The action plan is designed to accelerate the supply of all types of housing - social, private and rental.  Over the next six years, some 47,000 new social houses will be provided and housing output generally will be progressively increased towards the target of producing 25,000 houses per year through all channels.  The plan provides for early solutions to address the high number of households in emergency accommodation, such as 1,500 rapid-build units, 1,600 vacant units sourced by the housing agency and 1,750 HAP homeless tenancies, giving us a total of 4,850 homes as emergency, quick-fix homes.  The HAP services are, incidentally, run from Limerick and they do a very good job.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the situation in Limerick, I understand that the council is in ongoing contact with individuals and families residing in emergency accommodation and is fully responsive to the needs of those that may present to them.  The Limerick homeless action team works on a multi-agency basis to address the needs of people presenting to homeless services.  The three main centres in Limerick City are St. Patrick's Hostel, McGarry House and Thomond House and these facilities cater for the majority of people requiring emergency accommodation.  These services remain open on a year-round basis.  In addition to these facilities it is sometimes necessary for households to utilise bed and breakfasts or hotels for emergency accommodation purposes.  While it may be the case that some commercial hotels will close on certain days over the Christmas period, I have been reassured that Limerick City and County Council, working with all local homeless services, will ensure that the emergency accommodation needs of homeless households are attended to and alternative accommodation will be secured if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources for addressing homelessness have been made available under this Government and Exchequer funding is not an issue in this regard.  My Department will continue to keep the homelessness funding needs of all housing authorities under review.  We are visiting all local authorities and have made it clear to them that the increased budget is there for them.  Most of the homeless teams have had access to it so the finance is there.  It is sometimes difficult to source accommodation and we are addressing that with short-term and long-term measures but the funding is there for increased personnel needed by the homeless teams to provide the services.  I hope this will put the Deputy's mind at ease because it is a very serious issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700032#EE00400","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1481127900,"counter":370,"content":"<p>I commend the staff in Limerick who work in this area, both those in the council and those in the services.

The Minister of State will be aware of the statistics.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has identified a 30% increase from 2014 to 2015.  In the category of men who have sex with men, MSM, comprising predominantly gay and bisexual men, the increase in detections was even higher, at 34%.  Our rate of HIV infection, at 10.6 per 100,000, is significantly above the EU average of 6.3 per 100,000.  We must address the problem.  It is as big a problem in terms of numbers contracting HIV, as existed at any time during the 1980s and 1990s.<\/p>  <p>  We must take a wide variety of approaches to it.  It is a complex issue that requires a huge variety of actions.  However, I want to see if the Government can ensure that two simple, relatively immediate actions happen.  First, could we push the implementation group for the sexual health action plan to prioritise a decision to make pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, more widely available to high-risk groups?  The drug Truvada has been approved in Ireland.  International trials show it is extremely effective in cutting back the onset of symptoms of the virus.  The number of people appearing in accident and emergency departments, particularly at weekends, is at crisis levels.  Will the Minister, through the implementation group for the sexual health action plan, seek to have the drug made available for high-risk categories?<\/p>  <p>  Second, there has been very welcome funding from the national lottery to the voluntary organisation KnowNow's nationwide rapid HIV testing programme.  This needs to be preserved and the organisation needs to receive secure funding into the future.  It must be supported, given that it is one of the best immediate responses.  People who have HIV can find out very quickly.  It is a very simple test that can be done outside of clinical settings.  Half the men presenting to the programme to be tested have never been tested for HIV before.  Across the country, the detection rate is five times higher than in a typical clinical setting and in Dublin city it is up to ten times higher.<\/p>  <p>  The organisation is providing a vital service to allow men to find out whether they might be infected with HIV.  If we can expand and strengthen it, provide the drugs I mentioned and do a range of other sexual health education programmes that, no doubt, need to take place at the same time, it would help stop the immediate emergency which we face.  I would be keen to hear the Minister of State's view as to whether she would be able to provide those drugs to people in high-risk categories and whether she could provide secure funding for the KnowNow voluntary organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700033#FF00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1481128500,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this issue.  In 2015, 485 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in Ireland, an increase of 30% compared to 2014.  The increase was mainly confined to HSE east.  A number of factors contributed to the increase in HSE east, including an improvement to the national surveillance case definition introduced in January 2015, which resulted in improved sensitivity and timeliness and an increased number of notifications.  There was also an outbreak of HIV among people who inject drugs and an increase in diagnoses among non-EU men who have sex with men.<\/p><p>In 2016 a national. multi-sectoral group was established by the HSE HPSC to investigate the reasons for, and respond to, the increases in HIV, syphilis and gonorrhoea.  Clinicians, HSE public health, the HPSC, addiction services and the non-governmental organisations are all contributing to the group.  The group is working with the Gay Health Network and Positive Now to encourage the use of condoms and regular HIV and sexually transmitted illness, STI, testing via <i>man2man.ie<\/i>, social media and community outreach among the MSM community.<\/p><p>The National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 was launched in October 2015.  The strategy was developed in response to a recommendation of the national AIDS strategy committee on the need to establish clear leadership within the health sector around the area of sexual health.  At the launch of the strategy, the Department provided funding for the KnowNow pilot.  This is a peer-led, point-of-care HIV testing initiative in pubs and clubs.  The pilot has had considerable success in identifying new cases of HIV.  As we all know, earlier diagnosis of HIV allows for timely initiation of treatment, which confers significant benefits on the individual living with HIV and reduces transmission within the population.  The HSE is reviewing how this method of testing might be developed in 2017.<\/p><p>The National Sexual Health Strategy 2015 to 2020 contains 71 recommendations that address all aspects of sexual health and the sexual health action plan for 2015 to 2016 contains 18 priority actions for immediate attention.  One of the priority actions identified in the action plan for 2016 is to &quot;prioritise, develop and implement guidance to support clinical decision making for STI testing, screening and treatment and on the appropriate use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV prevention&quot;.  An implementation group has been established within the HSE as an outcome of this action.  The group will make recommendations on the appropriate use of HIV PrEP in the overall context of the national approach to HIV prevention.

It is one which could very rapidly grow if we fail to stem it at the earliest stage.  That is the advantage of the two measures I have set out in particular.  While there might be costs involved, it is clear that prevention is better than cure.  While the costs of identifying and supporting and providing those anti-viral drugs for the very high at-risk groups would have to be borne by the State, the advantage would be that the prevention of infection would not only save the quality of life of the individual who might otherwise contract HIV but also the State in terms of the services we would have to provide to that person through his or her life.

There is not a family in Dublin and the surrounding area that has not benefitted from the overwhelming gentleness and the unobtrusive caring and professional support of the hospice teams in Harold's Cross and Blackrock whether operating within the actual hospices themselves or through the home visiting teams.  Last Sunday, I had the privilege of attending with a number of my colleagues the annual \"Light up a Life\" ceremony in Harold's Cross.  There were over 10,000 people in attendance, most of them families of all ages.  It struck me as I left that we talk about six degrees of separation whereas there is probably only one degree of separation when it comes to lives that have been affected and touched in a hugely positive way by the work of the hospice movement.<\/p>  <p>  The backdrop on Sunday was a state-of-the-art education and research centre which is an indication that the hospice movement and the services it provides are moving from strength to strength and growing.  The State is going to become ever-more dependent on what is, by and large and in particular in relation to the home-visit service, a voluntary service provided by the teams within the hospices.  A new palliative section has been constructed which was not funded by the HSE.  The hospice hopes the HSE will see its way to funding equipment grants up to &euro;1.6 million and the second phase.  My colleagues, Deputy O'Callaghan and Deputy Curran, will I am sure develop those themes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700034#GG00500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1481129100,"counter":384,"content":"<p>I am very honoured to be given the opportunity to speak about Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross, which is in my constituency.  The hospice was founded by the Sisters of Charity back in 1879.  Sometimes, the wonderful contribution that religious orders of all denominations have made to health care and education in the capital and beyond is sometimes forgotten.  Even though it is described as being a hospice, Our Lady's provides a great deal more than care for those who are terminally ill.  It also provides a service to enable elderly people to live independently as well as services in respect of rheumatology and other specialist palliative care.<\/p>  <p>  The hospice is well aware of the challenges it faces into the future and the State needs to assist it in meeting them.  Ireland's over-65 population is growing rapidly and is expected to triple to 1.4 million over the next 30 years.  We need to prepare for that.  Fortunately, the hospice is preparing and has commenced the process of constructing a whole new palliative care centre.  It is also expanding the home care service.  I had the benefit with other colleagues here to visit the hospice and receive a guided tour of the wonderful new building.  It is an invaluable service and an institution that is loved by very many people in Dublin, as Deputy Lahart said.  That was evident last Sunday.  It is important that the State recognises the role of the hospice, not simply by talking about it, but by making some active financial contribution.  The hospice needs to be assisted financially in respect of the work that is going on.  The HSE did not fund the first phase of the build and I ask the Minister of State to provide some practical support financially.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700034#GG00600","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speech","time":1481129100,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I concur with the comments made by my colleagues.  This time last year, I had an uncle who was in the hospice.  He died at the end of December.  From a family's point of view, I cannot speak highly enough of the care he received and the manner in which he was looked after.  His immediate family feels likewise.  That is why, in some regards, I feel compelled to speak on the subject.<\/p>  <p>  Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I recently visited the new development.  Rather than speak about the service, which my two colleagues have addressed adequately, I will address the funding issue.  It is important to note that State funding to the hospice generally is down 25% on what it was in 2009.  The application for funding for phase 1 was refused, specifically because the committee said it could not approve projects retrospectively and that each agency has to follow the same procedures and submit applications in advance of projects being progressed.  Obviously, the hospice takes a different view and had been in touch with the HSE since 2014.  It received sign-off from the national director of primary care in February 2015, so there was a level of engagement.  In favour of what the hospice did, I note that it recognised the urgency and the reality that the facility was badly needed both to improve standards and, more importantly, to cater for a growing and aging population.<\/p>  <p>  It did not get funding for phase 1 but has clearly indicated that phase 2 and equipment could be considered.  As an organisation, the hospice is not in a position to continue to fund the capital.  It is engaged in fundraising to subsidise the revenue side, in other words the staff costs.  I appeal to the Minister to look specifically at this case.  It is one of the few opportunities we have where the development has taken place and the asset is there.  We are not saying we need this in five years' time.  It is here now but it needs the funding.  These people are not in a position to continue to provide that level of funding without State support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700034#GG00700","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1481129100,"counter":386,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies Lahart, O'Callaghan and Curran for raising this important issue.  It is the intention of the Government that people will be provided with the palliative care services they need regardless of their diagnosis, age or whether they die in a hospice, acute hospital, nursing home or at home.  Significant progress has been made in recent years to improve access to specialist palliative care services.  Currently, 93% of people receive specialist palliative care services within the community within seven days of referral while 96% have access to a specialist bed within seven days.<\/p><p>Specialist palliative care is now provided in 11 locations countrywide and the number of specialist palliative care beds will reach 217 once all 15 beds in Kerry Hospice are open.<\/p> <p> The successful development of palliative care service in Ireland has been based on a long-standing tradition of positive engagement between the voluntary and statutory sectors.  Organisations such as Our Lady's Hospice have played a vital role in this work by collaborating with the HSE in a very positive way on a range of fronts to strengthen the provision of palliative care.  Those who have experienced hospice care personally or for a family member almost invariably describe it as one of the bright spots in what can be a very difficult stage of life.<\/p> <p> On a personal note, and no more than many in this House who have experienced the type of palliative care that can be provided across the country, I know very special people work in the service.

It is something we need to do a little bit better in our society.<\/p> <p> In late 2015, Our Lady's Hospice embarked on a redevelopment of its palliative care unit in Harold's Cross to provide single rooms to ensure the dignity and privacy of patients and their families.

It is about fairness for those who are obliged to retire at 65 years of age when accessing the State pension and equality for all women when they retire.  This motion is about correcting the mistakes made by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in the pension reforms made in 2012.  Those reforms were made without any long-term thinking or forward planning and with no adequate processes put in place alongside those reforms.  This motion is about rectifying the injustices that were imposed on women by the marriage bar, which was not abolished in this State until 1973.  The marriage bar was an appalling injustice that impacted on an estimated 47,000 women and which has yet to be addressed.  The 2012 pension reforms were rammed through the Oireachtas and they were wrong.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed them then and we oppose them now.  In tabling this motion, we have engaged with a number of organisations on it, including Age Action Ireland, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.<\/p>  <p>  This week more than 5,000 men and women of 65 years of age will receive their weekly jobseeker's payment of &euro;188.  In many cases, these are men and women who worked for 40 years or more and contributed to their pension, but who cannot now access it.  These are people who were obliged by contract to retire at 65 years of age and who are left with a jobseeker's payment as their only option for income.  No 65 year old in this State should be forced to sign on for a jobseeker's payment due to the failure of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to plan effectively when increasing the State pension age to 66 years and abolishing the State transitional pension.  Where else in the world would one see a system where on retirement people are pushed into taking a jobseeker's payment for one year before accessing the State pension?<\/p>  <p>  I have lost count of the number of people who have told me the same story: they retire, as they are obliged to, at 65 years of age, apply for the State pension and are told they simply cannot have it.  The option for them is to apply for a jobseeker's payment and they are quietly told to take the money and not to worry about seeking work.  It is an absolute farce and a joke.  The situation is one of many examples of reforms being pushed through these Houses without any planning or care for the consequences.  The increase in the State pension age came about with no political debate, public consultation or cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  This motion is about fairness for those who have no choice but to retire at 65 years of age and who are being deprived of a pension that they have earned and paid into.<\/p>  <p>  A few weeks ago, a lady contacted my office.  Her husband had worked all his life, until he was forced to retire at 65 years of age.  He had no option but to sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  He had never looked for anything from the State and had always managed to support himself and his family through his work.  On his retirement, this couple decided to travel to Australia to see their children and grandchildren, but they were told that his payment would be revoked if they left the country for longer than two weeks.  This man died shortly after his retirement but his wife saw fit to contact me to inform me of the distress caused to her husband by the situation.  This man retired after a lifetime of work and paying diligently into his pension pot, but he simply could not access it.<\/p>  <p>  This issue has been raised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions time and again, yet its calls on the Government and the Department of Social Protection have been ignored.  Age Action Ireland has been to the fore on the issue and I commend it for supporting this motion.  It knows the hardship that these measures have had on our older citizens and its input into the motion has been invaluable.  Surprisingly, Fianna F&aacute;il's Deputies, who have been vocal on the issue, are noticeably absent for this important motion.  There is only one member of Government here and no member of the Labour Party is present.  Nevertheless, I can see no reason for any Deputy to come into this Chamber tomorrow to vote against the motion and against fairness for those retiring at 65 years of age.  I know that this issue has been brought to the attention of all Deputies by constituents throughout the State.  These same people will wait to see if their Deputies believe that they should be entitled to a State pension on retirement at 65 years of age.<\/p>  <p>  We know that women have been directly impacted by changes made to the calculation of contributions and the band rates imposed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2012.  These reforms have condemned thousands of women to poverty in their retirement years.  Ann said, \"I am totally disgusted with the system which does not entitle me to a full contributory pension after a lifetime of fully contributing to Irish society.\"  Peggy said, \"I and other women like me are facing a very uncertain and impoverished future.\"  Mary said, &ldquo;I was affected by the marriage bar; we are the forgotten women.\"  These are the thoughts of just three of the thousands of women receiving less than the full State pension.  For women, the pension system is utterly unjust.  Women who take time to care for someone or to raise children are discriminated against.  The impact of the imposition of the marriage bar, which was imposed on women, still lingers as it has lessened their pension entitlements.  This was not the fault of those women, yet they are the very ones having to pay for it to this very day.<\/p>  <p>  A person with a yearly average of 29 contributions who qualified for the State pension before September 2012 gets a pension of &euro;228.70.<\/p><p>However, a person with the same yearly average number of contributions who qualified after September 2012 receives a pension of just &euro;198.60, which amounts to a cut of &euro;30 per week.<\/p> <p> The National Women's Council of Ireland has highlighted the gender pension gap and, as part of its breakthrough manifesto before the most recent general election, called for this gap to be closed.  It was supported in its call by many before the general election, but it is not supported to such a great extent now that the opportunity to act has presented itself.  I thank the National Women's Council of Ireland for supporting the motion.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have talked the talk on pensions for years, but the time for talking, Green Papers, White Papers, studies and reports on pensions is over.  Action is required; we need to tackle pension inequalities now.  The simple choice facing all Deputies in the Chamber is one of fairness and equality.  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, in particular, must ask themselves two very simple questions about the motion.  First, is it fair that those who are obliged to retire at 65 years are forced onto jobseeker's payments?  Second, are women entitled to an equal pension?<\/p> <p> If the Government - Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il - is not willing to support the motion, I call on it to postpone increasing pension age to 67 years in 2021 and 68 years in 2028.  Ireland is moving much faster and further than any other European Union country in increasing pension age without having adequate plans in place.  Pension age should not be extended to 68 years unless it is done as part of an EU-wide initiative.  I ask the Department to seriously rethink the additional increases.<\/p> <p> The motion provides an opportunity for Deputies to do something to help those who have highlighted the issue of pensions in their constituency offices.  I am sure the same people, with thousands of women, will follow this debate and tomorrow's vote with interest.  I urge all Deputies to support the motion as a first step in tackling the various inconsistencies in the pension system.  The motion is about achieving fairness and equality for everyone in retirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700036#KK00500","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481130900,"counter":399,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in has introduced the motion because of the Government's failure to act on a gross and blatant pension inequality which will affect a growing number of people every year.  Appallingly, those most affected are predominately women.<\/p>  <p>  When changes to pension bands and rates were introduced in 2012, studies were conducted of their effects.  The worst aspect is that it was known at the time that they would primarily affect women.  Despite this, the changes were pushed through.  It is horrifying that, as a result of the way averaging works, women who left the workforce to care for children or elderly relatives are being cynically penalised on retirement by the Government.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme only extends to years spent as a homemaker after 1994.  This means, for example, that thousands of women affected by the marriage bar are excluded under the scheme.  We must remember that they were forced from the workplace.  The scheme leaves an entire generation of women to suffer the current cuts.  This generation took care of their children in the 1970s and 1980s.  On finally reaching retirement, they are being told by the State that their generation deserves a lower standard of living because of the pension changes introduced in 2012 which remain in place under the Government.<\/p>  <p>  What we have now are shocking cuts of up to &euro;1,400 in pensioners' payments at a time of cost of living increases caused by rising fuel and insurance costs.  What does the &euro;5 increase in the pension introduced in the recent budget achieve for the people concerned?  It is a pitiful, cold comfort.  Instead of the flat rate, across the board rise introduced in the budget, the Government could have addressed the specific gross inequalities in the pension system.  The motion seeks to have these inequalities addressed.  If, as may be argued, the logic for not doing so is that it would have an impact on the Social Insurance Fund, why have women been predominantly selected to suffer from these ruthless cuts?<\/p>  <p>  Some people will have their payments cut by &euro;30 per week.  Generally, women remain at a disadvantage when they reach the age of retirement.  Many women are in part-time or lower paid employment and generally less likely to earn as much as men, with only 16% of women receiving a full State contributory pension according to the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Despite Government commitments to close the gender gap, it has widened.  The European Institute for Gender Equality found a 37% gender gap in pensions in Ireland.  It is disgraceful that action has not been taken to address this issue and the Government has not undertaken real pension reform.  While the words spoken by Deputies in the House may well be forgotten over time, the action we take and the ways in which we improve people's lives will not be forgotten.<\/p>  <p>  Age Action Ireland and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland have urged Deputies to support the motion which asks us to recognise a generation of mainly women whom we all represent.  The Minister must reverse an inequality that will continue to grow, provide an equal pension for women and state clearly to the generation in question that they will no longer be penalised.  He must bring this generation of women in from the cold.  He will be remembered by those who are suffering and those who will suffer in the future if he fails to act now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700037#LL00200","speaker":"1362"},{"type":"speech","time":1481130900,"counter":400,"content":"<p>In the short time available to me I will focus on one particular aspect of the motion tabled by my colleagues, Deputies John Brady and Denise Mitchell, namely, the call on the Government to reinstate the State transition pension in order that workers can once again have the option of retiring, with the support of a pension, when they reach 65 years of age.  I have been contacted by people who are being forced to retire at the age of 65 years.  I am not embarrassed to say some of them were my classmates in school, as the clock ticks towards this major milestone in our lives.  I emphasise, however, that I was one of the youngest in my class.  Those whom I have met are in good health and enjoy their work.  People who have financial obligations and mortgages to pay simply cannot afford to be unemployed with no pension entitlement.  This is wholly unfair.  It is wrong that Irish law currently permits employers to impose mandatory retirement ages in their employees' contracts, in effect, facilitating ageism and creating a set of second class employment rights for older workers.  This should not be allowed to happen.<\/p><p>An argument used to support the current legal provision is that if people retire at an earlier age, there will be more youth employment.  Such statements have been dismissed time and again and I reject them.  A 2014 report from the IZA World of Labor research institute found the following:<\/p><blockquote>There is no trade-off in the employment of young and old workers:  Higher employment for older workers coincides with higher employment for younger workers ... Reducing the employment of older persons does not provide more job opportunities for younger persons.<\/blockquote><p>From a financial perspective, it is not in the country's interests to allow employers to impose this mandatory retirement age.  A worker forced into retirement at the age of 65 years is entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit of &euro;188 at the maximum rate until he or she turns 66 years.<\/p><p>Financially, it makes sense for an older worker to continue to contribute to the Exchequer rather than receiving payments from it.

As stated earlier, when the pension age is extended further the crisis will widen further.  Women, in particular, are vulnerable to this situation.  As stated by my colleagues, many women who worked for most of their lives and took a few years out from working to care for an elderly parent or their children now find themselves in the precarious position of their being entitled to only a very small pension or no pension.  These issues need to be dealt with properly.<\/p><p>In an article in last Tuesday's <i>The Guardian <\/i>the famous physicist, Stephen Hawking, dealt with the issue of globalisation and automation of production, the Internet and the many new ways of producing wealth.

These are serious issues that we need to deal with not only in Ireland but across Europe and the world.

I think we will have to have many more debates on this issue.  Discussions on pensions can often be very confusing.  This is because there are many different types of pension, including the State pension (non-contributory) which is means-tested and funded from general taxation; the State pension (contributory) which is not means-tested and is funded from social insurance; public service pensions; defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, which are private trusts set up by employers, and private pension arrangements like Personal Retirement Savings Accounts, PRSAs.  The challenges and issues relating to each of these arrangements are different and different solutions will be needed in different cases.  The contributions I have just heard in many cases demonstrate how confusing and complex these issues can be.  For example, the marriage ban was never the law in Ireland.  It has never been illegal for married women to work.  The marriage ban was a contractual obligation that applied mainly, although not exclusively, to public servants.  Public servants recruited prior to 1995 paid and still pay a lower PRSI rate of 0.9% and so they are not entitled to the State pension anyway.  They are not entitled to it whether they are men, women or whether married or not.  That is the work that works.  Sinn F&eacute;in is clearly confusing the State pension with the State contributory pension in that regard.  The motion as drafted does not comprehend most of those cases.<\/p><p>Another Deputy spoke about low pay.  A weekly contribution is worth the same regardless of how much is paid.  In other words, whether a person earns &euro;1,000 per week and pays 4% PRSI, which amounts to &euro;40 per week in PRSI, or &euro;200 per week and pays 4% PRSI, which is only &euro;8 per week, that counts as one contribution.  The contribution of a person on low pay paying &euro;8 per week is ranked equal to the contribution of a person on high pay earning &euro;1,000 per week and paying &euro;40 PRSI, so Sinn F&eacute;in's understanding in terms of how things work is wrong.  The motion appears to refer to changes that were made in 2012 and 2014.  These reforms were the restructuring of the rate bands under the State pension contributory and the abolition of the State pension transition which standardised the State pension age at 66.  The motion does not mention the positive changes in the State pensions over recent years.  It does not mention the increases in the rates of the State pensions this year and last year or the restoration of the Christmas bonus.  It does not mention the large increases in spending on these pensions from &euro;3.8 billion in 2005 to &euro;6.9 billion in 2015.  It does not mention the huge increase in pensioner numbers from 409,000 persons in 2005 to 577,000 at the end of 2015 and the projected further increases in the years ahead.  This, of course, gives rise to a major challenge to future sustainability and affordability, which, again, Sinn F&eacute;in does not appear to acknowledge in its motion.<\/p><p>The Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to make changes to the State pension would cost &euro;150 million next year and would, therefore, be a significant charge on the Social Insurance Fund and the Exchequer.  The cost would rise in 2018 and every year thereafter yet Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward no proposals in its motion to fund any of its plans.  Over the past five years, the Government has worked hard to bring the Social Insurance Fund from deficit to surplus.  This year, for the first time since 2008, the fund will have a surplus.  We have also reduced the Exchequer deficit considerably and intend to balance the books by 2018.  Prudent management of the public finances will allow us to continue to be able to pay the State pension and to make modest increases in the years ahead.  Running the Social Insurance Fund in surplus allows us the headroom we need to accommodate rising life expectancy and a spike in unemployment should there be another downturn.  We all know the awful consequences that can arise for current and future pensioners when pension funds are not adequately and sustainably funded.  By proposing to spend another &euro;150 million per annum on pensions without a funding proposal to match it, Sinn F&eacute;in is advocating an approach that will undermine the affordability and sustainability of pensions in the medium term.  This is reckless and irresponsible and it is bad for current pensioners and particularly bad for future workers and pensioners.<\/p><p>The fundamental objective of any competent pension policy is to ensure that pensions remain affordable, sustainable and retain their purchasing power or value into the future.  For this reason, I have proposed a counter-motion which outlines the challenges and the achievements in this area over the last few years and indicates the general approach the Government will take into the future.  The challenges we face are well known.  A welcome increase in life expectancy brings with it increased pension costs.  Without raising the State pension age, pensions will become unaffordable and unsustainable in the future and it will not be possible to maintain their value.  We will all lose out in that scenario.  The reality is that current workers aged 34 will be pensioners by 2050, and if we expect them to contribute to the pension system, we must be able to promise them that by the time they retire, they will be entitled to a pension which is at least as good as the one they currently fund for today&rsquo;s pensioners.<\/p><p>The changes to rates, bands and minimum contributions introduced for the State contributory pensions were designed to help ensure that the Social Insurance Fund was returned surplus, as it has done this year, and remains so.  The current Government, and previous ones, have sought to combine increases in the rate of the pension with reforms that make the system sustainable into the longer term.  This motion proposes that we ignore that reality and undo the important first steps we have taken to deal with this huge demographic challenge.  It is my view that where barriers exist to longer working, the Government, employers and workers can work together to remove these barriers while maintaining the safety nets available to people of working age.  We are not alone in having to face these challenges.  Every country in the developed world faces similar issues and the general approach adopted by nearly every country is to increase pension age in line with life expectancy and to attach greater conditionality in that regard.  Between 2008 and 2013, 12 of the remaining 27 EU countries increased the pension age for men and 16 increased it for women.  While these pension ages were largely lower than ours during that period, by the end of this decade, many countries will have a higher pension age than Ireland.  <\/p><p>In the 1970s, the State pension age was 70 and people rarely lived beyond their mid-70s.  Today, the State pension age is 66 and, thankfully, people regularly live into their 80s and 90s.  One does not to be an actuary or a mathematician to understand the funding and affordability issues that arise as a consequence.  There has been significant restructuring of the pensions systems in other countries.  For example, the UK - this also applies in Northern Ireland - recently merged the basic and second State pension into a unified new State pension.  This new pension has a rate of &pound;155.65 for people with 35 contribution years, which is less than &euro;185 per week, with the rate being reduced for people with fewer contributions.<\/p> <p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>We pay the full pension to people who in many cases have made contributions for only ten years.  As the Deputies will be aware, the current rate of the State pension here is more than a quarter higher than the figure I have given, even before the forthcoming increases.  I believe that we can take some comfort in the fact that, despite the financial crisis, we still manage to pay a State pension that is significantly higher than in many larger economies in Europe.  The result of our policies is that those over 65 have a consistent poverty rate of just 2.1% compared to 8% for the general population.  For neither men nor women over 65 is the rate of consistent poverty over 2.5%.<\/p> <p> In the future, there will be a number of challenges.  Clearly, if we are to maximise the benefits of longer life, we need to ensure people who can work longer are facilitated in doing so.  There is no compulsory retirement age in Ireland but individual employment contracts, including many of those used by public employers, contain a retirement age.  More flexible working and pension options should be developed to give people greater choice - for example, if they wish to remain in their current employment beyond 65.  If public policy is to encourage workplace reform that facilitates working beyond traditional retirement ages, then it is appropriate and necessary that the State, as the largest employer in the country, should be seen to take a lead with its own employees.<\/p> <p> In my role as Minister for Social Protection, I have received many representations, from public servants in particular, expressing frustration that they are being compelled by the State to retire from their current job at 65 or younger, regardless of the fact that they feel they have a lot more to give and would have a strong preference for remaining in the workplace.  I am aware of several cases where crucial personnel working in the health sector retired sooner than they wanted to and subsequently could not be replaced.  I have raised this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and I believe that there can be a change in this area, which, in turn, will provide leadership to the broader economy.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who will speak later, is of the same opinion.<\/p> <p> The contributory pension is just one element of a State pension system that produces similar outcomes for women and men despite very significant differences in income and contributions during working age, but I do acknowledge that there are anomalies and aspects that are unfair.  My officials are working on proposals to replace the current averaging system with a total contributions approach, which will provide a fairer basis for calculation of contributory pensions in addition to removing anomalies.  There is no pot of money for this change and, as with any such reform, there may be losers as well as winners if the reforms have to be cost neutral.  Crucial to the design of the final scheme will be credits for periods spent caring.  The position of women, but also some men, is central in this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700038#MM00300","speaker":"1236","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1481132100,"counter":405,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Personal Explanation by Member","time":1481132100,"counter":406,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700039#NN00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1481132100,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the House that, in accordance with Standing Order 46(1), I acceded to a request from Deputy Gerry Adams to make a personal explanation to the House.

It was a grievous loss for his family and should never have happened.  In the absence of the two Governments agreeing to a process to deal with the past, I sought to try to assist the family of Brian Stack to gain a degree of acknowledgement and closure.  I did so at their request.  What has happened over the last year points up the challenges of this course of action and the urgent need for a proper legacy process to be established.<\/p>  <p>  For the record, I will again set out the sequence of events and my efforts to assist the family of Brian Stack.  Austin Stack approached me in 2013 seeking acknowledgment for what happened to his father.  I met Austin on a number of occasions over the course of the following months, mostly on my own.  Austin and his brother Oliver made it clear to me personally and said publicly that they were not looking for people to go to jail.  They wanted acknowledgement and they wanted closure.  There is a note of that initial meeting, and I am releasing that today.  The computer stamp shows that this note was typed into the computer on 16 May, seven days after the first meeting with the family.  Austin Stack speaks of his commitment to restorative justice processes.  I believe him.<\/p>  <p>  I told the Stack brothers that I could help only on the basis of confidentiality.  This was the same basis on which I have tried to help other families.  Both Austin and Oliver agreed to respect the confidential nature of the process we were going to try to put in place.  Without that commitment, I could never have pursued the meeting they were seeking, which took place later that summer.<\/p>  <p>  The brothers were given a statement at that meeting by a former IRA leader.  That statement was made available publicly by the Stack family.  The statement acknowledged that the IRA was responsible for their father&rsquo;s death, that it regretted it took so long to clarify this for them, that the shooting of Brian Stack was not authorised by the IRA leadership, and that the person who gave the instruction was disciplined.  The statement expressed sorrow for the pain and hurt the Stack family suffered.<\/p>  <p>  Following the meeting, the family acknowledged that the process \"has provided us with some answers that three separate Garda investigations failed to deliver.  We would like to thank Deputy Adams for the role he has played in facilitating this outcome\".  Since then, the position of Austin Stack has changed.  In 2013, Austin gave me the names of four people whom he believed might have information on the case.  He told me that he had been given these names by journalistic and Garda sources.  Austin denies giving me names.  Why on earth would I say that I received the names from him if I did not?<\/p>  <p>  In February of this year, Austin Stack also claimed that he gave the names to the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  If Austin Stack was prepared to give names to Deputy Martin, why would he not have given them to me?  I was, after all, the person he was asking to arrange a meeting.<\/p>  <p>  At Austin&rsquo;s request, I contacted those I could among the names he gave me.  They denied having any information about the killing of Brian Stack.  I told Austin Stack this.<\/p>  <p>  During the election campaign earlier this year, the Fianna F&aacute;il leader and others repeated a lot of what was said in 2013.  It was obviously part of an election strategy against Sinn F&eacute;in.  However, in addition, allegations were made that I was holding and withholding information from An Garda.  It was in this context, and to remove any uncertainty or ambiguity, that I e-mailed the Garda Commissioner the names that Austin Stack had given me and which he said had come from Garda and journalistic sources.  I have never at any time described those named as \"suspects\".  I made it clear to the Garda Commissioner that I have no information on the death of Brian Stack.  The e-mail was sent only after I had spoken to three of the four.  There is a live Garda investigation.  I am prepared to co-operate with this.<\/p>  <p>  The position of the Fianna F&aacute;il leader, who was a Minister in successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments during the peace process, and of the Taoiseach during the period in question and on this issue is hypocritical, inconsistent and disappointing.  I have never sought publicity on these issues.  Any public comments I have made have been in response to others - first, when Austin Stack publicly asked to meet me and during the processes we established in 2013, and second, when Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il sought to exploit this issue as part of their election campaign of 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Today I make this statement in the D&aacute;il following an e-mail that I wrote to the Garda Commissioner being put inappropriately, in my opinion, into the public realm and then raised here in the D&aacute;il twice by the Fianna F&aacute;il leader.  I say \"inappropriately\" because there is a live investigation into the murder of Brian Stack and we in this Chamber should be mindful not to say anything that might prejudice this or any future court proceedings.  The Fianna F&aacute;il leader and the Taoiseach seem to be unconcerned about this.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin says I named four people whom I say I understand to be suspects in the murder of Mr. Stack.  Teachta Martin has misled the D&aacute;il.  I never made such a statement.  I have never described those named as \"suspects\".  He says that I said I took a note of the meeting between Austin and Oliver Stack and a former IRA leader.  I never said this.  I took no note of that meeting.  He says I took Austin and Oliver Stack to that meeting in a blacked-out van.  The Taoiseach even went so far as to say I drove the van.  That is not true.  I travelled with the Stack brothers in my own car to a pre-arranged place on the Border and then we were taken in a van to the meeting in the North, as had been pre-arranged.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il leader and the Taoiseach should correct the D&aacute;il record on these matters.<\/p> <p> After Fr. Alec Reid, Fr. Des Wilson, John Hume and I began our work to develop a peace process, successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments encouraged and facilitated meetings between Martin McGuinness and I and the IRA leadership.  Are the Taoiseach and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader now demanding that we should have named those we met?  Do they believe that it would have helped the peace process, a process which I hope we all appreciate?<\/p> <p> I recall a specific occasion when a meeting in St. Luke's with the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and Tony Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, was suspended to allow Martin McGuinness and I to meet the IRA.  On other occasions, initiatives involving the Irish and British Governments, the IRA, the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in were constructed to advance the process.  Meetings were adjourned to facilitate this.  These conversations helped to secure historic cessations.  Should those involved be named?  None of this would have been possible without talking to the IRA.  An Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin knows this.<\/p> <p> Our efforts led in July 2005 to the IRA announcing an end to\u00a0the armed campaign and engaging with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning to put its arms beyond use.  The process and progress could only have been secured on the basis of direct contact and confidentially.  Is An Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin demanding that Martin McGuinness and I should name those we were meeting in the IRA leadership and who decided to put their arms beyond use?  Is he demanding that the decommissioning body name those IRA members it met and who put those weapons beyond use?  Is he demanding that Cyril Ramaphosa and Martti Ahtisaari name those in the IRA they engaged with to facilitate the arms being put beyond use?  Should we now name all of those in the IRA who supported the peace process and took difficult, but courageous, decisions?  Others and I also assisted the Smithwick commission.  Should they be named?<\/p> <p> One of the most difficult legacy issues that we have had to deal with is that of the disappeared, a grave injustice to those families.  The Governments established the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains at my request and with Fr. Alec Reid's support.  As a result of our efforts, 12 of the 16 victims have been recovered and work continues on seeking information on the remaining four.  I have not given up on this.  Martin McGuinness and I continue to meet regularly with the commission.  The commission also meets former IRA people.  Should they be named?  An Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin knows all of this.  He was a senior member of the Government that established the commission.<\/p> <p> All of this progress was only possible on the basis of confidentially and trust.  That is why no IRA people were named during any of these initiatives and why they should not be named today.  It is an essential part of any conflict resolution process.  Sinn F&eacute;in has worked consistently to resolve the issues of the past.  As part of our commitment to this, I have met many families, like that of Brian Stack, and because I also have lost family members, I know how they feel and can understand their resentment towards republicans.  However, if the Taoiseach and An Teachta Miche&aacute;l Martin are interested in healing the legacy of the past for all families, including the Stacks, the Finucanes, the families of the Dublin-Monaghan bombs and hundreds more, they could begin by putting in place an international-based independent truth recovery process or make sure that the process that we set out in the Fresh Start agreement was working.<\/p> <p> My generation of republican activists who lived through and survived the war have a responsibility to try to bring the families of victims of the war, irrespective of who they are or who was responsible for their hurt, to a better place.  That is why I tried to do my best to help the Stack family in my engagement in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700039#NN00500","speaker":"1330","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481132700,"counter":410,"content":"<p>We will now return to the motion re pension equality and fairness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700040#OO00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481132700,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I am sorry to interrupt, but I wish to raise a point of order.

Any system whereby if one pays 520 full contributions, one may qualify for a full old age pension, but if one pays three times that - 1,560 contributions - one qualifies for something less than a full old age pension, is patently and obviously unfair.  We have sought to change this.  For example, I have published a Bill on the matter that I cannot move because it would place a charge of the Exchequer.  However, our efforts will continue.<\/p>  <p>  Numerous times, I have asked the Minister for Social Protection whether it is possible for the Department to find some way to deal with the situation of a person who chiefly starts working later in life being exempted from this averaging if he or she has paid very few stamps in previous years, for example, a student who worked during the summer holidays or someone who only worked for a small number of weeks.  Even before we change the system, surely it is possible to have such people averaged from the date on which they actually started full-time work.<\/p>  <p>  The motion refers to the increase in the contributions required from 260 to 520.  This change was introduced side-by-side with the averaging and compounds the unfairness.  First, people must get over the high fence in the shape of averaging.<\/p><p>Second, one has to get over Becher's Brook immediately one has surmounted that fence.  The change from 260 to 520 contributions has practical consequences.  I will give an example of real people, two women, in my constituency.  Invariably, those affected are women - in 95% of cases.  Both are from Limerick and one is a farmer's daughter while the other is a shop owner's daughter.  They both worked in their respective family businesses when they left school and no contributions were paid, luckily for one of them.  They got married shortly thereafter and entered the workforce later in life.  One of them worked for 12 years.  She had 522 contributions and 66 credits.  One can amalgamate them for the purpose of calculating the rate of pension.  That was an average of 49 contributions per annum over 12 years.  The result is that she is entitled to a full pension of &euro;238 per week from 7 March.  The other woman worked for ten years and seven months.  She paid 517 contributions and 28 credits.  Therefore, on the second criterion she would have qualified.  She had an average of 52 contributions per annum.  Although she only paid five contributions fewer than someone who is getting the full pension she is not getting any pension whatsoever.  That is unfair.<\/p> <p> There is a difficulty with the retirement pension for people who have reached the age of 65 who have been in gainful employment all of their lives.  I cast no aspersions nor do I look askance at people who draw social welfare.  However, in many cases 65 year olds who have worked for 40 years or more find it mortifying to have to go into the social welfare office and sign on for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  There is another implication as well.  If the retirement pension had stayed in place a single pensioner would be &euro;45 per week better off than someone on jobseeker's allowance so he or she is losing out.  The sum of &euro;45 per week is considerable for a pensioner.  A married person claiming for a dependant incurs a loss of &euro;70 per week, which is a very substantial loss.<\/p> <p> I was told by the previous Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that an interdepartmental committee was being set up to deal with the situation.  I asked the Taoiseach on several occasions about the committee's deliberations but he kept fobbing me off.  That is not an exaggeration.  I have reluctantly come to the conclusion now that the interdepartmental committee was a scam because when we raised the matter in the social welfare committee last week the Minister for Social Protection told us, more or less, if I heard him correctly, that the interdepartmental committee was a waste of time.  It simply analysed the problem and did not proffer any solution, but he hopes to devise a solution in the social welfare Bill which he will introduce in the first quarter of next year.  I sincerely hope he will because the problem is not going away.<\/p> <p> Two main sections of society are affected.  The first is women.  Let us face it, under successive Governments women in this country have been discriminated against quite a lot.  We should not allow the discrimination to be perpetuated by leaving these unfair provisions on the Statute Book.  The other group that is affected is the elderly.  Old age is something to be enjoyed not endured.  The elderly are not demographic time bombs or bed blockers, they are the people who built this country and they are entitled to live out their later years in some degree of peace, security and happiness and they should not be forced to go up to the labour exchange and sign on and show they are capable of work.  The social welfare officer usually says that he or she will say nothing about that anyway.  It is a case of a nod and a wink.  The person is getting &euro;45 less per week anyway so why bother.<\/p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s counter-motion does not address the core issues.  We know the money has been provided for 2017 and any changes introduced would have to be addressed in the budget for 2018 unless we can get money out of the sky but we want the matter dealt with in 2017.  Reading through the counter-motion I detect a lack of urgency in the Government's position on the matter.  We will not support the Government&rsquo;s counter-motion.  In fact, we will oppose it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700040#OO05800","speaker":"1227","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481133300,"counter":468,"content":"<p>With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is not present because I wished to pick him up on a couple of specific points he made during his contribution.  He spoke about the range of pensions that are available and about Sinn F&eacute;in not paying attention or acknowledging the positive aspects of the regime.  However, that was not a fair comment.  It was disingenuous in response to what Deputy John Brady was trying to do.  He was trying to highlight a specific anomaly that exists in respect of the State contributory pension, which primarily affects women.  That is the underlying problem.  It was very far into the Minister's speech before he recognised the point, but that is the fundamental issue.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter of fairness and equality.  Deputy Brady was correct when he made the point that when the additional bands were introduced it adversely affected women more than anybody else.  The concept of averaging is not a fair system.  In other words, somebody who enters the workforce as a young person, who takes time out and does not get credits, who re-enters the workforce for the latter part of his or her career has a low average, whereas if somebody only entered the workforce at 45 years of age and worked for 20 years to the age of 65, he or she would have a high average.  The averaging system is causing anomalies which are primarily affecting women who have not been able to get credits prior to 1994 and the matter must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  It is something that was raised in the budget and was discussed on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  Deputy John Brady is cognisant of the fact.  It is an issue of which we will not let go.  From a committee point of view next Thursday we will begin an in-depth analysis of pensions, but this area of the pensions sector in particular &ndash; the contributory State pension and averaging, which is unfair and does not lead to equality - is something we will examine in considerable detail.  The issue is not going away.  It is disappointing that the counter-motion tabled by the Government did not at least recognise the crux of the problem that Deputy John Brady was trying to highlight.  I do not say the Government had to agree with the motion but it should have been nailed down.  We discussed the issue on Committee Stage of the Bill.  We have all received representations on the matter and it must be addressed.

As Deputy John Curran said, the crux of the issue has not been addressed and we must thank Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing the motion to the House.  I also thank Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea for drawing up the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment.<\/p>  <p>  I am no different to many other Deputies and I have clinics in my office on a weekly basis.  Women have come before me and at first I did not understand what they were talking about.  I did not think something like that could have happened, that the averaging system could have been introduced.  Likewise, I found it hard to understand that it was another woman who introduced the change in 2012.  It is quite shocking to think one could start working at the age of 16, take a couple of years out to rear one&rsquo;s children and then go back to work until retirement age but not be entitled to a pension.  In those days there were no child care facilities.  If one did not have family support, one had to do it oneself.  Those people thought they would be entitled to a full pension when they came to retirement age but, regrettably, the averaging system was introduced and that affected such women adversely.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the amount in most cases that is at issue, it is the principle that is at stake.  The problem is the denial of equality to a person's entitlement to a full pension.  In most of the cases I have come across the money lost is between &euro;18 and &euro;23 per week.  It is not &euro;50, &euro;60 or even &euro;70.  It seems like a small amount of money but I do not deny that over time it adds up to a lot.  In many cases the women who came to me had not raised the issue previously or even spoken about it.  They were mortified to bring it up.  They were a little bit embarrassed.  However, as more women are coming across the issue online and discussing it over a cup of coffee they are becoming quite irate.  They feel rejected by the fact the Governments to which they paid their tax and PRSI through the years singled them out.<\/p><p>Why were they taken advantage of and why did they pull the short straw?  We are talking mainly about women, but in some cases men took years out to mind a bachelor uncle.  As Deputy Willie O'Dea said, some of them were far too proud to sign on.  In fact, some of the ladies in question did not know they could have signed on.  If they had, they would have qualified.  We did not have the Internet nd great communication skills at the time and the people concerned were disenfranchised.  As a female, it is regrettable that only I have a voice to represent the people who have been sidelined and feel let down.  It is very important that we discuss this issue and it must be more than a discussion.  Something concrete must be done in 2017.  At the very least, there must be engagement about reviewing the entire process.  It is disappointing that the Minister left the discussion.  This sends a very negative message that he is not prepared to engage, that he is not listening and that he does not want to hear about the inequalities of the past, but we are not talking about a time ten or 20 years ago but three years ago.  If it is being said we are ready for recovery, it has to be built on the efforts of those who built the State.  They include the women who stayed at home to rear and educate their children when they were receiving no other support from the State.  I spoke to one lady who had started work at the age of 16 years, taken a number of years out and had 1,016 credits, double the amount required, but she is still &euro;28 short.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700041#PP00300","speaker":"1231","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481133900,"counter":471,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy John Brady for raising this very important issue in the D&aacute;il.  I have raised the issue of inequality in contributory pension payments time and again in the D&aacute;il and raised it this time last year in Cork County Council because it is so troubling for so many families.  I raised it last October with the Minister for Social Protection.  It is unfortunate that he is not present, but the Ministers of State will convey the message to him.  He said there would be a review and that there would be winners and losers but that there would be no legislation to deal with the issue next year.  It needs to be dealt with now because there are no winners.  Everybody, particularly those in receipt of a reduced pension, is losing out.  The issue needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later.<\/p>  <p>  The Government needs to deal with the situation where people, predominantly women, who are working in the home minding children or caring for elderly relatives will find themselves in receipt of a reduced pension not just this week but every week for the rest of their lives.  The issue is ongoing .  There is also age discrimination.  Owing to the fact that this measure was introduced in 2012, people with the same number of PRSI contributions who retired after 2012 receive a lower pension than an older person with exactly the same number of PRSI contributions who retired before 2012.  A moral hazard is also being created where people who paid into the system could find themselves retiring on a lower pension than somebody who made far fewer contributions or none at all in the case of non-contributory pension.  <\/p>  <p>  The ending of the State transition pension is another aspect of the motion and I will hone in on it very briefly because so many people have been placed in such an unsatisfactory and difficult position.  They are being forced to retire at 65 years, but there will be no pension payble to them.  They are being forced to sign on for a year and will, as Deputy Willie O'Dea said, receive a jobseeker's payment.  They are also being forced to lie to the State by saying they are actively seeking work to receive that payment.  It is a case of a lnod and a wink and away they go with their payment.  We need to examine various options, including possibly writing off contributions or extending the home carer's credit.  The situation where people are unequal when it comes to the contributory pension must be dealt with.  It is unfair that people who have paid into the system for many years are in receipt of a reduced pension.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700042#QQ00200","speaker":"1284"},{"type":"speech","time":1481133900,"counter":472,"content":"<p>It must be acknowledged that the State pension is the cornerstone of pension provision in Ireland, particularly at a time when 60% of those in the private sector have no pension scheme.  I commend Deputy John Brady for bringing forward the motion.  It is imperative that we have a pension system that is secure, fair, sufficient, sustainable and, most of all, equitable.  While pension increases are very welcome, they must also be accompanied by the reform we so badly need.  The majority of people in Ireland rely on the State pension to provide a decent income in retirement.  The impact of the current method of calculation on women and retired workers forced onto social welfare payments has been huge.  The gender pension gap has widened in recent years to 37%.  This<\/p>  <p>inequality is directly related to women taking time out of paid work to care for children or family members and losing the opportunity to build enough PRSI contributions to qualify for a full contributory pension.  We must ensure pension equality for women is front and centre in pension reform.  There has been been ongoing discrimination against those who take time out of their careers to care for their children or elderly family members.  For every week I have been in office since February, a person has come into my office to tell me of their shock on reaching their 66th birthday and realising the payment they will receive from the State will be considerably lower than what they have planned for.  What is the country saying to those who take time out to care for their children, those who volunteer, those who selflessly put careers on hold and those who do the State a service, in many cases, by caring for the most vulnerable members of society who might otherwise have ended up in care?  I recently spoke to one lady who was losing &euro;30 a week because of the way the payment was calculated.  Another lady started working in 1966 and had built over 80 contributions.  However, only 52 can be counted.  She is receiving &euro;196 instead of &euro;230.  To add insult to injury, when the pension was increased by &euro;3, she received &euro;2.60.  So far, it has generally been women who have been affected by this anomaly.  How can we move forward to encourage having an equal place for women in the workforce when there is such open discrimination? <\/p>  <p>  More 65 year olds are on the dole than people of any other age.  This is because the Government abolished the transition pension while still allowing employers to get rid of older workers through mandatory retirement clauses.  Action by the Government to reform the State pension system is long overdue to ensure it is fair and sustainable and enables people to age with dignity.  The Minister must reform the way pensions are calculated.  We must value the contributions the people concerned have made to society and ensure they will not be penalised and confined to poverty on retirement in many cases.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700042#QQ00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1481133900,"counter":473,"content":"<p>It is tough going in a short space of time, but Deputies are doing well.

It is timely, given the recent attacks by Mr. Denis O'Brien and Mr. Dermot Desmond on the pensions of workers in Independent News and Media.  I express the solidarity of the AAA-PBP to those workers and the thousands of others whose pension benefits and rights to a decent pension are now being questioned and attacked as unrealistic.   I note the counter motion tabled by the Government and must say how pathetic it is.  It is part of a wider narrative to place the issue of pensions in a certain light.  We are told that because people are living longer, it is a problem, not something to be celebrated.  We can only fund pensions from a fixed pot of money.  That is a problem.  If we increase payments in one category, it means that we must cut payments for some other category.  That is a problem.<\/p><p>According to the Government, that the poverty rate among pensioners is lower than other groups is a problem.  This might partially explain its heroic efforts in the recent past to increase the poverty levels of pensioners.

When I raised the issue with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, he suggested the policy on changing the bands for a contributory pension was motivated by a desire to be fair to those who had worked longer.  Like most of what Minsters say on any of these issues, it is totally disingenuous.<\/p> <p> My amendment to the Social Welfare Bill on this issue was ruled out of order.  We could have made changes without having to continually battle on this issue, but it was ruled out of order by the Minister.<\/p> <p> The purpose of those changes was to save the State costs.  The State is very keen to make savings at the expense of workers but still bails out bankers to the tune of more than &euro;8 billion a year plus interest and refuses tax due from Apple.  By changing these bands the State will save &euro;50 million in 2017 and &euro;10 million in each subsequent year.  By scrapping the transition pension, the State saves &euro;75 million to &euro;80 million a year.  By increasing the paid contributions needed for a contributory pension to &euro;520 the State saves &euro;6 million a year, which is a nice bit of piggybank pocketing.<\/p> <p> Of course, as the years goes by and workers have to work until 68, more millions will be saved by the State.  This money is taken from the pockets of pensioners.  It will not be used to fund other essential services despite the self-serving platitudes of various Ministers because there is still a huge shortage in hospitals, education, special needs, etc.; it is not filling a hole.<\/p> <p> Regarding the \"problem\" of people living longer, what is often missed in this debate is that workers living longer than the past generations are fully paid for in financial terms because in recent decades Irish workers have become increasingly productive, based on the statistics.  It is entirely possible to maintain and improve the pension entitlements of workers who are living longer, but we cannot do it if we continue to widen the inequality in the share of national wealth going to workers in terms of wages and pensions compared with the share going to the wealthy in capital and profits.  That goes to the core of the so-called crisis in our pensions.  It is not the greater longevity of the workforce or the people, or trying to balance different groups' interests, but the fact that a greater and greater share of the national wealth goes to the wealthy rather than to social services or to workers' wages.  That is what is happening.  It is very clear from the way Independent News and Media treated its workers and pensioners.  What is happening at State level is reflected throughout the workforce.<\/p> <p> I again mention the &euro;3 billion we are rejecting from Apple and the countless billions we are refusing to take in taxes from REITs, multinational corporations, the hospitality sector and from the load of wealth that exists in this country.  This is the root cause of the crisis in pensions.<\/p> <p> This debate is timely, in a week in which the shareholders of Independent News and Media sanctioned a smash and grab of their workers' pensions in order to improve the financial position of Denis O'Brien and Dermot Desmond.  These are two people who do not by any stretch of the imagination need more money.  It is timely that we set out a rejection of the logic of a State that thinks forcing working people to work longer for less and discriminating against workers is a just cause or makes economic sense.<\/p> <p> I wish to outline the one peculiar and outrageous example of how the State thinks discrimination against women is acceptable, which goes to the heart of this motion.  Some months ago when dealing with a constituent I was amazed to discover that the State believes that it is acceptable to discriminate against women, because it is overwhelmingly women who raised families in this country before 1994.  The State made the adjustment to take into account the homemakers after 1994 and to penalise those who made their home before 1994.<\/p> <p> We have legislation that recognises that workers may take time off from the workforce to raise families.  While the State will take those years into consideration when calculating their contributory pension, it will not do this for women who raised families before 1994, which is ridiculous.  It is discrimination on a gender basis and on an age basis.  Many women, who recently retired and who raised families in the decades of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, in an era when women generally began their families much younger, suffered greatly in this State under a range of headings and now find their expected contributory pension has been reduced, often by as much as &euro;30 a week.  This is insulting and hurtful, and must end.<\/p> <p> I do not accept the argument that if we correct this discrimination we must hit some other vulnerable group.  This is nonsense to mask the State's contempt for these women and to try to justify the taking of &euro;30 a week from women who worked for decades and paid their contributions to the State.<\/p> <p> The revealing aspect of this debate is that the State is willing to legislate to discriminate and take money from some of the most powerless groups in our society at a key stage of their life.  Let us compare it with the lethargy and slowness to legislate for rent controls or to deal with corporate fraud.  There is a stark contrast in how we deal with one group as against the other.<\/p> <p> I welcome the debate and, of course, we support the motion.  This is not the end of the issue.  It will require campaigning, people power and political pressure to put an end to this blatant discrimination.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700042#QQ00500","speaker":"1367","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481134500,"counter":476,"content":"<p>Deputies Joan Collins, Clare Daly and Broughan are sharing eight minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700043#RR00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1481134500,"counter":477,"content":"<p>One of the most regressive measures introduced by the last Government was the 2012 pension cuts, which disadvantaged tens of thousands of women who had taken a hiatus in their working lives.  To put this in context, two thirds of those in the bottom two contribution bands are women, and they experienced losses of more than &euro;1,000 per year to pensions that were already low.  These penalties undervalue the crucial work women do in Irish society, not only in the workplace but also in social reproduction and the care work that is often unpaid but is absolutely essential to the fabric of society.  Women should not be penalised for these essential contributions to our society.  These reforms were also blind to the reality of working life in modern Ireland, where more and more people identify as underemployed, being in precarious work and often out of work for significant periods.<\/p>  <p>  I want to respond to the argument, made by people like the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that Ireland cannot afford to provide good pensions at 65 to all who need them, or that it would mean cutting elsewhere.  This is a trick deployed by right-wing politicians to pit every campaign for justice and equality in this country against other people looking for a decent standard of living.  It chimes with their efforts to create a free-market society - one where all of us compete against each other day in, day out for the crumbs off the table while a tiny number of people walk off with the cake.<\/p>  <p>  The truth - I believe the people know this - is that there are many people with a lot who pay far too little in tax, and whose tax dodging is paid for by the rest of us.  For example, businesses in Ireland pay less than half the European average in PRSI.  In complete contrast with elsewhere in Europe, personal taxes on working people raise three times as much as their employers' PRSI.<\/p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister provided me with figures, showing that a 2% increase in the rate of employers' PRSI would yield an enormous &euro;1.3 billion per year.  It is ironic that it was the former T&aacute;naiste and Labour Party leader, Deputy Burton, who introduced these pension cuts.  Today a former Labour Party Senator, who is now working as a lobbyist in Retail Excellence Ireland, has stated that one of her tasks is to reduce employers PRSI.  It seems that those who cut, then make sure that we cannot get any benefit from them.  The money is available to give every elderly person in the State a decent pension, to ensure people can retire at a humane age and to reverse the discriminatory penalties against women, but the Government has made a political choice not to do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700043#RR00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1481135100,"counter":478,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly to this important motion on pension equality and fairness.  I commend my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues for raising the matter in the House.  It is one I have raised many times as it affects a great many of my constituents in Dublin Bay North, especially women.  It has been brought to my attention consistently during the years.  <\/p>  <p>  I welcome the point made by Sinn F&eacute;in in the motion about developing the Social Insurance Fund to provide for a universal pension payment for all men and women.  We know that the gender pension gap is now 37% and that just 16% of women are in receipt of the full State contributory pension.  This proves that the time women take out of the workforce to care for children is not valued equally by the State.  I have previously asked the Minister how much money full-time carers save the State as they are simply not valued and rewarded sufficiently for providing that care.  They are further disadvantaged when they reach retirement age.  The homemaker scheme was introduced in 1994 to try to address the most blatant inequalities, but it did not work in bringing about equality for women.  The Minister has informed me that the estimated cost of backdating the scheme to 1973 is &euro;150 million, or &euro;160 million if backdated to 1953.  The State must take full responsibility for the imposition of the marriage bar for so long.  <\/p>  <p>  I fully support the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland in its call, made last week to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, for the introduction of a universal pension payment.  I fully support the calls made in the motion for pension rates and bands to be restored to their pre-September 2012 levels and for the reduction of the number of contributions required from 520 to 260, the number in 2012.  I also agree that the State transition pension should be reinstated.

The Government does not seem to recognise it as a priority.  It would be wrong not to mention the atrocious treatment of pensioners under defined benefit schemes, including the Irish airlines (general employees) superannuation scheme, IASS; the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, scheme and the Independent News and Media, INM, scheme.  It must be addressed by way of fundamental legislative change, not by piecemeal measures, in order that solvent employers will not be allowed to walk away.  It is interesting that the Minister has asked the Attorney General if she could intervene in the INM case.  Clearly, he want to keep journalists sweet as he did not share the same concern or want to intervene in the CRC case, in which the issues were very similar.  <\/p><p>Other Deputies have spoken about the fundamental unfairness for women who have hundreds more than the 520 PRSI contributions needed but who still do not qualify for a full contributory pension because of the ridiculous averaging system used.  It is so bad that one would almost be forgiven for wondering if the system had been designed deliberately to have that impact.  I will not reiterate the points made by other Deputies, but I shall point to the response one woman received from the Minister when she wrote about the fact that she was in receipt of a fraction of her full contributory pension because she had left work to raise her children.  The Minister wrote to her and said:<\/p><blockquote>When it comes to the view that this represents discrimination against women, it is worth being aware that ... it is a fact that women generally get more back from their PRSI contributions than men. This is particularly true for women with lower earnings and shorter contribution years, even though they may pay the same PRSI rate as men.<\/blockquote><p>To me, that is an absolutely contemptuous indicator of how much the Department devalues the work women do in the home and in rearing children.  She was told she was lucky to be in receipt of half of the pension paid to her male counterparts, despite the fact she had spent all of her adult life working.  It is unbelievable.  <\/p><p>I want to finish by reading an email from the husband of a woman living in my area.  She is set to lose out on a full contributory pension because she was forced to leave the workplace when she got married.  He puts it well in one or two lines:<\/p><blockquote>My wife will qualify for the State contributory pension in October 2017 but will only receive about 84%.  This is because she raised three children whose taxes are now being used to fund the State.  It seems somewhat ironic that the State is now reaping the benefits of my wife's decision to be a stay at home mother while at the same time the State is punishing her for doing so.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700044#SS00300","speaker":"1259"},{"type":"speech","time":1481135100,"counter":480,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I know that there was criticism of the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for not being in the Chamber for the debate.

Perhaps the Minister might be able to listen to debates while in the air if we get the Air Corps to upgrade the Government jet.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the motion and certainly support its intent.  I am not sure, however, if it really deals with many of the major issues that will affect those who will reach pension age in the coming years and find that they either have no entitlement to a pension or are only entitled to a reduced pension at best.  Far too often we meet people who are reaching pension age and worried about what will happen once they hit the age of 65 years.  Many people are being forced to retire at 65 years and sign on for jobseeker's benefit, which is totally farcical.  People who have always wanted to work are being forced to go to a labour exchange, which is absolutely ridiculous.  While I understand people are living and working longer, something must be done to support those who are being forced to retire at 65 years of age.  It is unacceptable to force pensioners to sign on to receive jobseeker's benefit having worked their entire lives.  I also support the call for the State transition pension to be reinstated.  It is a problem that the Bill does not indicate what the cost might be.<\/p>  <p>  There is also a problem with yearly averaging of contributions.  While I understand the nature of the call made to have the number of contributions required reduced from 520 to 260, I do not believe this is the real problem.  It would do very little in dealing with it.  The real problem is the yearly averaging of contributions.  In this day and age very few people will have a difficulty in reaching the 520 contributions required to qualify for the State pension as ten years of full employment is sufficient to reach that number.  In the past many women were forced to leave the workforce when they got married or chose to care for their children in the home, a decision which was commendable, but they were subsequently penalised for doing so.  In the next ten to 15 years many women will discover on reaching pension age that they will not be entitled to a pension at the maximum rate, despite potentially having worked for over 30 years.  This is a terrible anomaly.  I acknowledge that the Government has introduced the homemakers scheme to try to cover those who chose to care for their children in the home, but the scheme does not include those who cared for their children before 1994, which is hugely discriminatory.  It also only covers the care of children under the age of 12 years.  We all know that rearing children between the ages of 11 and  20 years is probably the hardest and it is also the most expensive period.  I am unclear as to the success of the scheme and know that there are many people who cannot avail of it and who will now struggle to receive a full contributory pension.  <\/p>  <p>  I have two examples to highlight the unfairness of the system.  Let us consider the case of a woman, or a man, who started work at the age of 17 years and then took 16 years out of the workforce to raise her or his children before returning and continuing to work until she or he reached pension age.  The person concerned will have accumulated the 520 contributions required without any difficulty but because of the 16 year gap in his or her employment record he or she will only receive a pension at a much reduced rate as he or she could have a yearly average of just 19, which would mean his or her pension payment would be reduced by &euro;81, which is disgraceful.  I ask the Minister of State to take this on board.  Despite having worked for over 30 years, he or she could potentially only be entitled to a pension of &euro;152 per week.  This is an actual case with which I am dealing.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>At the same time, somebody who comes to live in Ireland at the age of 55 and works for ten years prior to reaching pension age will have no difficulty obtaining the 520 contributions and could potentially have a maximum yearly average of 48, thereby being entitled to a maximum rate pension of &euro;230.  There is a clear anomaly which needs to be checked.<\/p> <p> Despite the fact the people in my first example could have worked for 30 years in Ireland, they have a reduced rate pension, but a person who only works for ten years before pension age could potentially have a maximum rate pension.  There is an inherent unfairness in this situation, which is clear to anybody.  Reducing the contributions is not the answer if we do not examine the workings of the yearly average.  I do not believe reducing the contributions from 520 to 260 will do anything for these people.  Instead, the focus should be on examining the yearly average, which is the problem, and how this affects people receiving their pensions.<\/p> <p> There are many reasons people could have a break in their records.  For example, if someone entered the workforce at 17 but decided to take a number of years out to return to full-time education, which happens very often now, thankfully, and subsequently went travelling, that is a break.  If people lose their jobs and are not entitled to a jobseeker's allowance payment because their partner is working and they cannot sign for credits, that is a break.  If people emigrated for a number of years during the recession, as so many had to, and then returned home, when they come to apply for a pension they will find that they will not be entitled to the maximum rate pension because of the gap in their record.  This is very unfair.  It is the yearly average that causes the greatest problems, in my estimation and in that of my office staff, and I believe these issues need to be re-examined very closely and very quickly.<\/p> <p> The other issue is the way in which the non-contributory State pension is assessed.  The qualifying income thresholds for the non-contributory State pension have not been increased in more than ten years and many people find they have no entitlement to a pension because of the income of their spouse or partner.  It is time for an increase in this regard.  I also have major concerns about the manner in which earnings are assessed.  Any cash income is assessed in the means test, but earnings of up to &euro;200 per week from employment are disregarded.  This is not the case for self-employed people or farmers, and every penny earned by self-employed people or farmers is taken into account.  This is very unfair and discriminatory.<\/p> <p> It is time for significant pension reform.  When I speak about reform I do not just mean increasing the pension age, as the Government intends to do.  I do not agree with this.  We must ensure fairness and equality, and there are many examples of a lack of fairness in our current system.  The fact there are more 65 year olds on the dole than any other age is an insult to our retired pensioners and we must examine the reasons.  This cannot be ignored.  We know they are not ever going to gain employment, unfortunately, because of their age.  Those over 50 constantly report how difficult it is to gain meaningful employment, so we cannot pretend that very many 65 year olds are easily going to gain employment after being forced to retire, and they should not be put in this situation.  It is ludicrous to force them to go to the labour exchange, a place they never visited and they do not know where it is.  I am not demeaning anybody who goes there, but they never went there.  They always worked hard and it is totally unfair.  People suffer greatly because of it.  They are intimidated by it.  It makes many people mentally and physically sick because they never went there and they do not want to have to go there.  It is unfair to put them in this trap for 12 months.<\/p> <p> Many women will not receive a full State contributory pension.  The fact that only 16% of those receiving a full State contributory pension are women is a shocking indictment on a system that penalises women who took time out to care for their families.  We should reflect on this.  The system has to be reformed and has to be looked at retrospectively so that those who cared for their children before 1994 are not the biggest losers, which they are at present.  This is very discriminatory.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700044#SS00500","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481135700,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I will share time with Deputies Healy, Donnelly and Ryan.<\/p>  <p>  The Social Democrats are very happy to support the motion on pension provision, particularly with regard to the State pension.  It is true to say pensions need urgent attention, and there needs to be very clear policy in the area and a roadmap set out for the future.  There is much uncertainty about the pensions situation at present, whether with regard to the changes to the State pension we have seen in recent years or private pension provision.  We need direction and leadership from the Government in this regard.  If we take the fact approximately &euro;3 billion is spent every year on providing tax relief to people who put away money for their pensions, we know 80% of it goes to people earning at the top rate of tax.  To some extent we must bear in mind the people subsidising this are people on low incomes who, perhaps, have no pension provision themselves.  This creates an unfair situation whereby we allow people to put away very big pension pots which benefit from tax relief and at the same time, for the same amount of money, we pay the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  The State pension must become the mainstay of pension policy and must be linked to the consumer price index in terms of increases, but should reflect a percentage of the average income.  We need to move to having certainty on the level of State pension.  It is also important there is confidence in the State pension and that the rules will not change, so that people who pay into it over their lifetime will not be hit with a rule change which negatively impacts on them.  This happened when the number of contributions required for a full State pension was increased.  This impacted in particular on women who had taken time out of the workforce.  There should not be midstream changing of the rules.  There should be recognition for time out of the workforce for child minding or other care responsibilities.  This should be reflected in the requirements for the number of contributions.<\/p>  <p>  Another point is with regard to people who are no longer entitled to the State pension or transition pension at 65, and who are told they must wait until 66 even though they are required to retire at 65.  We need to change the law in terms of contracts so people can stay beyond 65.  We also need to stop the situation, which is so insulting to people who perhaps have worked for 40 years, whereby they must, at 65 years of age, go on jobseeker's payment.  It is entirely unacceptable and should not have been allowed.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue is the extension of the pension age.

The Government could have done this in budget 2017 in all the areas the Deputy has raised but it refused to do so.  The Minister and every Teachta D&aacute;la in this House know that austerity has deeply and disproportionately affected women.  This is a fact which is backed up by all the reports that have been done by independent groups which have analysed budget after budget since 2009.<\/p>  <p>  This is not by accident either; it is by design.  Care work is highly gendered and leads women to put family needs before their own by taking themselves out of full-time employment and a normal career path which is, in fact, highly gender-biased towards men.  The fact that women in general take care and social support roles in our society means that when the State supports in these areas are cut it is women who are expected to take up the slack.  When women leave full-time employment or turn down a promotion because of family commitments this affects the credits they are able to build up, with knock-on effects for their pension entitlements.  Instead of acknowledging this the Government actually reinforces this inequality through legislation and pension rules.<\/p>  <p>  We still have not heard what Fianna F&aacute;il is going to do, although it has tabled an amendment as it always does.  It rarely support sensible, realistic and costed proposals brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in and the last time Fianna F&aacute;il was in power it slashed social supports while putting over &euro;20 billion into Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The effects of that decision are still with us today.  The crisis was caused by a cosy cartel of bankers, developers and politicians but it was low-income to middle-income households, lone parents, and many, mainly female, low-paid public and private sector workers who were made to pay for the mess.  Those who were not able to defend themselves at the time were made the key targets of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael when it came to picking up the pieces.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the motion to the House and hope that Fianna F&aacute;il and the other so-called Opposition Members of this D&aacute;il support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700046#UU00400","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1481136300,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I have spent the vast majority of my working life defending workers and their rights and I came in here to continue that work.  That is why I believe this motion is so important.  The impact of the gender pay gap is felt by women at every single level in society and most acutely by the cohort of women that will face retirement in the very near future.  I appreciate that there are people in this House who believe the gender pay gap is the fault of women themselves, for not wearing the right g&uacute;na.  I believe they call it \"dressing for success\" but the gender pay gap should be addressed by direct action from the Government and this House.<\/p>  <p>  I will tell a story about a man who, to protect his identity and his dignity, I will call \"Paul\".  I had the honour of presenting him with a badge to mark 50 years' membership of the trade union for which I worked.  On retirement at the age of 65 he had to go to the place he referred to as the \"labour exchange\".  He told me he was not on the dole but had retired after 50 years of working.  When the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was here earlier he tried to give us a lecture about what pensions were and how they operated but I will take no lecture from the Minister or anybody else about how pensions operate because I know, and so does Paul.  His was an integrated pension and he had to go onto the dole.  After 50 years of working, that man had retired and was not unemployed.  He had finished working and had finished paying tax in the days when, as my mother used to say, \"tax was tax\".  He paid every shilling he was supposed to pay and, God love him, he was also an activist in the Labour Party.  He asked me, \"Can we not contact the Labour Party and see what it can do?\"  I said, \"No, it was the Labour Party and its very best friends in Fine Gael who did this to you\".  It gave me no pleasure to say that to him.  People are entitled to the dignity of a decent retirement after 50 years of working so I urge Deputies, in particular those who think we can address the gender pay gap by dressing a bit more smartly, to support this motion.  It is important and enjoys the support of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the broad trade union movement, for all the reasons I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700046#UU00500","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1481136300,"counter":490,"content":"<p>By any standard this motion is very straightforward.  It calls for the reinstatement of transitional State pension, the restoration of pre-September 2012 pension rights and a reduction in the number of contributions required to qualify for State pension, from 520 to 260.  All these things are important and need to happen but central to all of it is the notion of pension and labour market equality for women.  In a 2007 report, Pensions - What Women Want, the National Women's Council of Ireland repeatedly emphasised the need to engender the Irish pension debate.  Gender, class and race are now recognised as the three main organising categories in society.  We also know that these categories overlap and cut across each other to produce inequality, poverty, power and privilege.  We see this very graphically in the ongoing pensions debacle where, as a result of a policy decision taken in 2012 by a Labour Party Minister, thousands of women are now actively discriminated against on the basis of their gender.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton's 2012 policy was, in essence, both gender and class blind.  For example, it failed to take into account the fact that, for most women, childbirth, caring and homemaking take up huge parts of their adult lives and also require them to move into and out of the labour market.  In hindsight, the 2012 changes to the State pension regime resembled something from another era when women's work inside the home was rendered invisible and of less value than participation in a male-dominated labour market.  The recommendations in the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion seek, as a first step, to address this inequality.<\/p><p>At the very least, such changes, if adopted, would not only be beneficial for women but would also form part of an anti-poverty strategy in that they are also beneficial to the many low-income groups which experience cumulative labour market disadvantage and a subsequent high risk of poverty in old age.<\/p> <p> The report from the Low Pay Commission on the over concentration of women in precarious work, which means low pay, uncertain hours and exploitation, is before the Cabinet.

A wide range of pension issues were raised in the debate and they involve different potential policy responses.  I intend to focus on the issues outlined in the motion, which were the main focus of the debate.<\/p>  <p>  Everybody's key objective is to ensure pensions are sustainable and of value into the future.  As has been stated, the cost of pensions has increased by over 60% in the past decade in real terms.  We are a growing and ageing population, and any insinuation that we see this as a burden on society is unfair.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I think we value older people more than ever and we can grow from the knowledge they bring to us.  The ratio of workers to pensioners will halve in the coming decades and the Opposition Deputies must acknowledge this.  While we will continue to increase the rate of the State pension to improve its adequacy, this cannot be achieved without reforms that will also ensure its adequacy.  A failure to do so would make the financing of pensions an even larger burden on already hard-pressed workers.  Very few people are looking to increase the rate of PRSI or taxes they pay, yet that is what would be involved in reversing the reforms listed in the Opposition motion.  I see no other funding proposals to match what is being sought this evening.<\/p>  <p>  A person who has not made many contributions to the Social Insurance Fund will be supported by the system through the State non-contributory pension, which is 95% of the maximum contributory pension depending on his or her household means, or in the increase for qualified adults payment of 90%, which is based totally on his or her own means.  This means for a couple, of whom only one spouse has a full PRSI record and contributory pension, the total income will be at least 195% of a full contributory pension.  If they receive less than this in the State pension payments, it is because their total income, including State pensions and other means is greater than 195%, and very likely more than the value of two maximum rate contributory pensions.  While this does not make them rich by any means, it makes them among the better off of those aged over 65.  People aged over 65 are far less likely to be in poverty than the workers who fund the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  Approximately half of those of pension age rely solely on the State pension, and over 70% of those in receipt of the non-contributory pension qualify at the full rate and over 80% of those in receipt of the increase for a qualified adult, IQA, qualify for the full rate.  Where people qualify for only a reduced rate of non-contributory pension or the IQA it is because they have significant other income and will, generally, have a higher total income than half of the pensioner population who rely on the State pension.<\/p>  <p>  We have a contributory pension system funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.  Anybody who has not paid into the system to a great extent will still receive a pension if he or she needs it.  The changes made in recent years have the cental objective of making the system sustainable, and failure to protect pension provisions into the future would hurt those most in need, many of whom depend solely on State pensions.  It would be particularly unfair to today's workers, half of whom are working women who have to pay for child care and mortgages, to expect them to pay more and more into a pension system that, as has already been pointed out, would be broken by the time they reach the age at which they will depend on it.<\/p>  <p>  There are issues with pensions, particularly with people being made retire before pension age.  No simple solutions are in the Opposition motion and there is no pot of gold to deal with the issues.  Even with the reforms attacked by the motion, the cost of pensions is increasing at over 60% per decade in real terms and only so many years of such growth can be managed before it all collapses.  There is a danger of unintended consequences and, therefore, a need for a thorough debate and consultation on any proposed changes.  I am glad to hear the total contributions approach will have a consultative process that will allow the various stakeholders to set out their priorities.  Having the process ahead of the introduction of legislation will result in more balanced legislation being introduced and a better informed and more genuine debate in the Oireachtas when it is brought before us.<\/p>  <p>  Pensions reform impacts not only on what happens now but on the outcomes for people in decades to come.  The total contributions approach reform is a great example.  It was announced in 2010 but was deliberately and rightly scheduled for 2020 by the Government of the time.  The Government recognised that PRSI had been extended to the self-employed only two decades earlier and that postponing it to 2020 would allow people the opportunity to build up the required contributions.  This Government may or may not be the one to introduce the legislation.  It will depend on goodwill on both sides of the House to pass it.  I can think of few issues on which cross-party consensus is more appropriate.  Pension reforms are long-term projects and failure to make the right choices now will impact greatly on the choices of future Governments.  It is in the interests of everybody that we have a sustainable pension system which provides a decent income to our older people if they need it or if they have contributed to it.  As the Minister outlined previously, there has been significant restructuring of pension systems in other countries to meet the rising costs of pensions.  The UK's new state pension is more than a quarter lower than our State pension.<\/p>  <p>  As a young woman who has met many women in my office and many organisations as Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I agree pension equality for women must be addressed, and it will be.  The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is working on proposals to replace the current yearly average approach to State pensions with a total contributions approach, which will provide a fairer basis for the calculation of contributory pensions as well as removing anomalies.  The issue of the age of retirement and people having the opportunity to stay in their employment beyond set retirement terms in many employment contracts is raised with me regularly as Minister of State with responsibility for older people.  The issue has been brought to all our attention.  The interdepartmental group on fuller working lives chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recognises that mandatory retirement ages can compel employees to leave employment even though they may be fully able to contribute to work and would otherwise like to remain in the workplace.<\/p><p>I can think of many people in that position.<\/p> <p> Deputies also mentioned the difference in the amount received and the fact that people often have to seek support which they never had to do before.  This clearly goes beyond social protection legislation and, as Minister of State at the Department of Health, I note that it clearly goes beyond my Department's legislation too.  The Minister for Social Protection and I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and the point that the largest employer in the country is the State has been made.  Thought has been given to what can be done to make progress in the area.  It is not, however, something that can be resolved through these proposals.  It would be dishonest to pretend it could.  The Government is very conscious of the issues that have been raised here tonight.  I hope Deputies understand why some of these changes were made and the costs that would be involved in reversing them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700047#VV00300","speaker":"1337","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481137500,"counter":495,"content":"<p>I intend to focus on the issue of gender and women in regard to the motion.  I commend Deputies John Brady and Denise Mitchell for bringing it forward.  As a woman, the issue of the shocking pension gap in the State really stands out.  It is also a critical issue for many women in my constituency.  Many Members have brought up the point about people calling into their offices.  Many of these women feel they are being discriminated against for having had to care for either their children or relatives.  The reality is that women generally take up this role and I agree with them 100% in regard to their feelings of being discriminated against.  On a very basic level, one has to look at the cost of child care in the State and how it impacts on women's capacity to remain in the workforce.  We live in a society where the cost of child care can be the cost of a second mortgage.  For parents with several children, the cost is completely out of reach.  Understandably, a parent, generally the woman, leaves her job to become the primary caregiver.  Often, women do not leave work fully but become part-time.  Many of those women do not realise the impact this will have on them later in respect of their pensions.  It is only when they come to pensionable age they realise that because they reduced their hours or took parental leave, their pension contributions will not be equivalent to those of a man.  The reality is that these women will have reduced pensions on retirement.  The gender pension gap in the State is 37%, which is fifth highest in the whole of the EU.  Only 18% of those receiving the full contributory pension here are women, which is appalling.  It shows how many women do not qualify and that, in turn, shows that there is something very wrong with our system.<\/p>  <p>  The motion is an effort to correct the reforms in 2012 which hit women very unfairly.  It is bad enough that the gender pay gap is around 14% but to think that the pension pay gap is knocking on the door of 40% is unbelievable.  Women who have worked their whole lives and, indeed, those who are still working deserve fair and appropriate provision for later in life.  Women contribute an enormous amount to the workforce and wider society and it is pitiful that we have come to a stage where we feel we have to fight for basic equality on pension rights, often after a lifetime of commitment to employment.  In many cases where women give up their jobs to raise children for a period or to look after an elderly parent or relative, they are saving the State money.  Nevertheless, they are met with the assertion that they do not have the full contributions for a pension, which is scandalous.  I urge Deputies to support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700048#WW00200","speaker":"1266"},{"type":"speech","time":1481137500,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I am not surprised that Fine Gael is not going to support the motion because it is not in touch with the ordinary people out there who rely on the contributory pension we are discussing or with the grave inequalities that have been brought about.  It is noticeable that the Labour Party Members who introduced these pension reforms back in 2012 have not even appeared in the Chamber nor, indeed, participated in the debate.  The motion will be voted on tomorrow in the Chamber.  There was a great deal of talk, in particular from Fianna F&aacute;il, and it is also noticeable that there is something absent from the amendment the party tabled.  Fianna F&aacute;il has spoken a great deal about the 37% gender gap.  It spoke about it yesterday in the Seanad and has referred to it time and again.  Yet, the amendment it has brought forward to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion does not address the issue at all.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has provided funding in our pre-budget submission, which was fully costed by the Department.

If we are serious about ending the injustices about which many Members have spoken, now is the opportune time to do so.  I urge all Members to do it.  <\/p>  <p>  I thank all those Deputies who have co-signed the motion.  Many of them referred to the number of people coming through their constituency offices on a daily and weekly basis and the difficulties that face 65-year olds who have worked for 50 years and more in some cases only to be told they have to sign on for jobseeker's payments.

There is a chronic lack of supply which has contributed to a housing crisis, unprecedented levels of homelessness, enormous social housing waiting lists, completely unsustainable rents and mortgage arrears.  Overcoming this lack of supply is vital but the most obvious way to do it, which is a well-funded scheme of housing from the Government, is not forthcoming.  The strategy in this Bill aims to facilitate proposes to provide only one third of the housing needed to clear waiting lists.  This is not an adequate response to the housing crisis and, in fact, things will get worse under Fine Gael's national rental strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the amendment made on Committee Stage in the Seanad which deals with the speculative hoarding of land.  It is essential that the new fast-track planning permissions are not held back for years on end, rendering the procedural changes useless.  The most efficient reform of planning would be more extensive use-it-or-lose-it policies.  There are 28,000 permissions outstanding and not acted upon in Dublin.  The solutions include introducing the vacant site levy earlier - 2018 at the latest - as well as a four-month limit on outstanding planning permissions.  What use is an expedited process if developers can simply hold on to the permission and not build?<\/p>  <p>  It is difficult to see how planning can be fast-tracked effectively without dealing with staffing issues.  Unless we are prepared to examine that question, any fast-tracking is open to result in shoddier planning rather than more effective procedures.  I am also concerned about the diminution of the role of local government in the planning process which the proposed changes seek to bring about.<\/p><p>The fact that decisions were passed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in a way that would allow county plans to be bypassed is very worrying, limiting further the role local elected officials can play in determining how their communities develop.<br\/><br\/>There has also been much discussion about the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment in the House.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the research of the Private Rental Tenancies Board which shows that 91% of landlords own three properties or fewer.  In that context, the amendment proposed by the Seanad to protect tenants in the case of five or more properties being sold off is the very minimum we need.  The Government's proposal that these protections be limited to the 0.54% of landlords who own ten or more properties is totally unacceptable.<br\/><br\/>I want to propose that we approach these issues from two perspectives.  The first is from the position that there is a housing crisis that affects the majority of people in the country and not just a small minority.  The second is that we need to consider tenants' rights as the issue at hand.  In the case of the latter, there is an equity issue to be considered in the introduction of security of tenure solely for tenants in a tiny number of properties which do not apply to other tenants.  We need to explore ways to protect all tenants, not just a few, in cases where properties are sold.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the amendment introduced by the Seanad to limit the exemptions offered to landlords in this case.  As housing expert Lorcan Sirr remarked in <i>The Sunday Times<\/i>, the Bill, as originally drafted, would allow any landlord worth his or her salt to drive a coach and four through it.  It is vital that the attempts the Seanad has made to close these loopholes remain.<br\/><br\/>It is important to highlight changes made in regard to receivers.  Many tenants are fearful of the results of receivership because receivers are not subject to the same laws as landlords.  This must be changed as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>I want to comment on the Bill as part of fulfilling the national rental strategy.  What we need to solve the crisis in the private rental sector is commitment to fundamental reform.  This does not just mean measures to facilitate developers, rather it means a Government policy that stops the entire housing sector being turned over to the market.  Without adequate rent security provisions or a major scheme of public housing construction, we will not be able to solve the biggest crisis in the country today.<br\/><br\/>The solution to this profound crisis cannot be found in simply speeding up the existing process.  It can only be found in changing the ideology that has underpinned how we have dealt with housing in this State for decades.  We need a Government which is willing to say that housing is a right for every person, that paying for it should not drive a person into poverty and that it is too important to leave its provision to private profiteers.  Until we achieve that, we will be putting a sticking plaster on a wound that cuts to the very heart of this society.  That is the essence of what is happening today.<br\/><br\/>I am sure every Deputy has received an e-mail from Focus Ireland.  We all received e-mails from supporters of the campaign.  My inbox is full of them.  I would like to read it because it is important.  It is from Mike Allen, who says:<\/p><blockquote>I am writing to you concerning the planning Bill that you will be debating this week and our campaign to close off one of the main routes through which families become homeless.  You will have received some of the almost 40,000 emails which have been sent by supporters of this campaign directed at their own TD and giving their own address.  We thank you for your courtesy in responding to these.<br \/><br \/>From front-line work, we see more than 20 families each month becoming homeless simply because their buy-to-let landlord has been forced to sell up.  This is the cause of homelessness for about a third of families becoming homeless.  The issue is not just about 20 families becoming homeless this month, but also about the almost 15,000 households who have a buy-to-let landlord who has arrears of over two years.  There is little doubt that without legislative changes most of these families will find themselves evicted from their homes over the next couple of years even though they may be completely up-to-date with their rent and have years left on their tenancy agreements. <br \/><br \/>The proposed amendment is both fair and proportionate, given the scale of human misery which will result from inaction on this issue.  Individuals, banks and lending institutions which entered into a buy-to-let arrangement did so in the full knowledge that part of the business plan was to provide a home for a tenant.  Many have benefitted from the section 23 and other tax reliefs and the Focus amendment limits their options if they want to sell so that they must sell the property with the tenant in place.  This is commonplace in commercial rents. <br \/><br \/>Focus Ireland recognises and welcomes the strong cross-party concern and commitment that exists on this issue.  We recognise that the Government's Tyrrelstown amendment is well-intentioned.  However, it provides protection for only a tiny percentage of all tenants and in our experience excludes virtual of the tenants who are at real risk.  The Tyrrelstown amendment is also undermined by the loophole that allows landlords to set aside tenant protections where they can increase the sale price by 20% through doing so.<br \/><br \/>While we understand that this provision is designed to address constitutional concerns, we believe it is misconstrued.  It is surely not the intention of the Constitution that a price should be put on the protection of the family home.  If goodwill alone was enough to solve the problem of homelessness there would be no child facing Christmas cramped in a hotel room.<br \/><br \/>We understand that the solutions to homelessness are complex and many will take a number of years to make a difference.  The hard truth is that there are very few policy changes available to us which can help quickly reduce the numbers of families which become homeless.  Focus's proposal, which has been drafted with expert assistance, is one of the very few interventions capable of slowing down the family homelessness crisis the short term.  They hope that the D&aacute;il will support it and in all truth if the D&aacute;il decides not to support such a simple measure it is hard for Focus to conceive of any meaningful measure which it would be prepared to take.<\/blockquote><p>That should be taken on board by the Minister because it is a fact that those living in buy-to-let properties will be the worst affected.  In cases where tenants are paying their rent in full, have no problems with the rent and are expected to remain in a tenancy agreement for a number of years, but whose landlord has to sell because of problems, the unit should be sold with the tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  That is the least we can do to protect families who could face homelessness over the next year or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700048#WW00800","speaker":"1306","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481138100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>Deputy Mattie McGrath is sharing time with Deputy Danny Healy Rae, ten minutes each.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700049#XX00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1481138100,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I am delighted to speak on the Bill.  I welcome many aspects of it, which address the under provision of housing.  It has become an acronym.  We are addressing the issue, but things are not happening.  More homes cannot be built because young couples living in the country who have sites and, in some cases, planning permission for housing cannot get money from banks.  I will not say what one would not get from the banks.  They will not approve any loans.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill refers to accelerating social housing and improving the rental sector, which are noble objectives.  I have been here for nine years and the crisis has been around for some time.  We are discussing what we will and will not do.  I was on the Committee on Housing and Homelessness, and compliment Deputy John Curran for his work.  We are all talk and no action.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, to the House and wish to refer to some matters that are his area of responsibility.  The OPW is under his remit.  The Bill proposes to introduce the streamlining of arrangements to enhance flood relief, which is badly needed.  A flood will come and sweep some of the officials away.  Tree-huggers, planners, the EPA, the NRA, TII and the whole lot of them were not to be seen last year when we were under water for months.  They could not be found, they were in hibernation.  One cannot cut a bus in a river or open an inlet.<\/p>  <p>  I hope what is proposed works.  I believe the Minister understands the situation.  He is a quantity surveyor, and understands what needs to be done.  We have to get rid of all the quangos.  It will be some job because, as far as I can see, they have mushroomed.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will also enable the Minister to make payments from the local government fund, which is vital.  Flood works were done in Clonmel, which were largely successful - I addressed the Minister of State about that last week.  We will have to drain the rivers.  We can build walls as high as the roof of the Chamber, but that would be a waste of time because dirt from roads and other wastage are flowing into them.  They were always clean, but now because of certain environmental agencies they cannot be touched.<\/p><p>Having completed the new sewerage scheme, which cost &euro;16 million, I met people in Clonmel who had made their living from the River Suir by selling eels to the now defunct Clonmel Arms.  When we put in the treatment plant, the water was pristine - it was almost as clear as the glass I hold - but there was not an eel in the river, or any other kind of life either, including plant life.  We need to check if the remedy and the medicine is worse than the pollution.  However, this is not about pollution.  I wish the Minister of State success in the many areas he has visited.  He visited my county, for which I thank him, and listened to the people and their families and understood their language.<\/p> <p> To get back to other aspects of the Bill, I want to refer to the building of more homes.  With the permission of the Cathaoirleach, I wish to refer to a press release that I issued in desperation on 28 September 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700049#XX00300","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481138700,"counter":506,"content":"<p>Is it on topic?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700050#YY00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1481138700,"counter":507,"content":"<p>It is on topic.  It was headed \"Less than 7 houses built in Tipperary in 2015\", referring to those built by the local authorities.  That was in September 2015 and we are now at Christmas 2016, going into 2017.  I stated that the latest house building figures released by the Department for County Tipperary - they were not my figures - confirmed the scale of underinvestment in the county.  The House must remember that we had Alan the Mighty, who was the Minister at the time, and, God, what he was not going to build, knock out of his way and get done.  It was unreal.  That was his way; he could not wait to get at it.  He was going to leave a legacy after him.  He left some legacy all right.<\/p>  <p>  In the press release, I spoke about the data from the building control management system managed by the Local Government Management Agency - again, they were not my figures - which showed that only six publicly available houses were built in County Tipperary up to the end of July 2015 while 2,920 people were on the approved housing list in the county.  The figure of approved applicants for social housing in County Tipperary is now well north of 3,000.  We are not even scratching the surface.  One would not know that Deputy Kelly ever came to Tipperary or was ever Minister with responsibility for the environment, although he was in Europe.  He pledged to stay there for five years when he got elected, but he came back after two and a half.<\/p>  <p>  In the press release, I noted that these numbers were incredibly worrying and pointed once again to the total failure of the last Government to address the scale of the housing emergency with anything like the speed that was required.  We can have all the Bills we want in this House, but nothing is happening.  There is no excuse for work: taking out a pickaxe and a shovel.  We built houses when all we had was pickaxes and shovels.  We had labourers, whom I salute.  I will not say they worked as Mary O'Rourke once said about some kind of a man because it might be inappropriate, but they worked very hard and built houses with no equipment or machinery.  Nowadays we have all the machines and equipment in the world along with designers, architects, special advisers and you name it, but we cannot build anything.<\/p>  <p>  From March to December 2014 no houses that could have been placed on the public market were built in County Tipperary, while only 30 one-off houses were built, although more people would have built one-off houses had they been allowed.  I know lots of couples that cannot get planning permission on their own land because the process is too rigorous.  They have the vision, passion and energy to build their own houses but they cannot get the planning permission or the loans because of all the red tape.  In 2015 the number of publicly available houses had not reached double digits, with only six houses being built for that purpose, while 50 one-off houses were built.  That was only 80 or so houses altogether in the two years.  I stated that it was now a matter of clear and certain judgment that the then Government had failed, as had the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in respect of his promises.  Deputy Kelly now speaks on Bills and what this Government should do, but he did nothing himself.  It is the kettle calling the pot black.  One would think he was on a different planet.  The Labour Party had many other issues as well when Deputy Howlin was the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  That was the situation.  I feel so sorry for the homeless and those who need homes.<\/p>  <p>  The buy-to-let scheme is a solution.  Some 200,000 units are being bought up by vulture funds while this Government wants to change the legislation to fast track cases through the Circuit Court.  I, with the land league and others, stopped Circuit Courts in their tracks from evicting people.  In many cases, county registrars - these people are not even judges - were basically throwing people out of their homes.  We stopped them in their tracks, but now the Government wants to change the law to allow them to take on that role again.  It will be cheaper, mar dhea, and there will be only so much in legal fees.  It is a Bill aimed at fat cats, although I mean no disrespect to the Cathaoirleach, who is an eminent lawyer.  I heard lawyers in this House arguing that it would make the process faster and easier on families, but it does not matter what representation those families have, they will be evicted from their houses unless this is stopped in its tracks.  We must not change that law.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the e-mail from the Simon Community, Focus Ireland and other organisations today, which Deputy Collins mentioned.  I got it as well.  There are 200,000 buy-to-lets in the country.  No one who is paying his or her rent should be fired out of the house.  Many pubs, shops and businesses are sold on with tenants in them.  It is standard practice every day of the week.  Why can it not be done here?  It is greed.  The banks and the vulture funds see a killing.  The greed must be stopped because it has gone on for far too long.<\/p>  <p>  A recent census report stated that more than 100,000 properties are vacant.  We are codding ourselves.  We need to take a dose of Epsom salts, pinch ourselves hard and smell the coffee.  These are houses that are available.  Many of them are boarded up and this Bill is only tinkering with the situation.  I see houses in my own area where finished estates have been abandoned for the past seven or eight years.  They should be subjected to a compulsory purchase order by the county council and a reasonable rate given to the developers and builders.<\/p>  <p>  There are some very good builders out there.  Not all builders and developers are monsters as portrayed by certain Members of the House.  Many of them are good people.  Small builders could make a big dent here and lift the rural economy too by getting a start.  T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre, if only they could get the money from the bank.  They are only out to make a small profit to feed their families, employ people and do the one-off houses.<\/p>  <p>  We are not examining many available options.  We have various committees and reports from those visiting various parts of Dublin, but this will all be an abject failure because we are not doing anything.  We have lost our way.  Our county councils have lost their way as well.  They have also lost the interest and the skills.  I do not know what they have lost, but they just cannot build the houses, although they could build them when they did not have any expertise.  We have architects to design one-bed, two-bed, three-bed and four-bed units.  Why can we not have the one design for all counties adapted as appropriate to the particular site?  It is because the architects would then not have their pound of flesh.<\/p>  <p>  We need to look deep and examine the quangos.  I wish the Minister of State and his successor well in dealing with them.  I know how involved they both are in the flooding issue.  I will not say much more because I think my time is nearly up.  However, I ask the Minister of State to go down to the place in Clonmacnoise I mentioned to look at the flooding issue there.  I know the Minister of State will go down to see that friend of mine in his constituency and that he will try to deal with those who are trying to keep out the floodwater.  However, we might as well be getting ready to get on the ark while we are waiting for the public officials and various departments to build houses.  It is not going to happen.  The wind is out of the wheels and the wagon is bunched.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700050#YY00300","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1481138700,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I too am glad to speak on the housing and rental crises again.  Nothing has been discussed more than this topic since I was elected to this House.  It was mentioned in the programmes for Government day after day and even before I came up here it was discussed in Kerry County Council.  So much has been said, but words are not enough because words will not build houses.  These Bills will not build the houses either, but certain things need to be done.<\/p>  <p>  I disagree with Deputy Mattie McGrath when he stated that the local authorities had lost their way in house building.  The Taoiseach also said that and I got very cross with him that day because that is not true.  How could the local authorities build houses when they did not have any funds to build them?  There was mention of 30 houses being built in Tipperary last year.  In terms of social housing, three rural cottages were built in County Kerry in the past seven years.  That is a fact.  It is the Gospel truth and nothing but the truth and it is a shame and a disgrace given the number of people on the housing list.<\/p>  <p>  We were promised &euro;62.5 million at the start of 2015 to address the housing crisis in Kerry but, as of yet, not one social house has been built.  There are only a few days left in 2016 and I know that no houses will be built before the end of the year.  However, 22 houses are to be built in Killarney.  They went out for tender during the summer, but they have been put out for tender again.  As a result of the restrictions the Department has imposed, no official in Kerry County Council would sign off on the tenders that came in and this now has to be put out for tender again.  It only went out the other day.  I worry about whether these houses will be built in 2017.  I hope they are but I am not so sure.<\/p>  <p>  Private builders are not building houses.  The only houses that are currently being built in County Kerry are one-off houses that are being built by farmers' sons, etc.  A few houses are being built by local people who have enough money to build a house but others cannot get money from the banks.<\/p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The developers and builders will tell us this.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath stated, rogue builders were blamed for the crash but many good builders also went down in the crash.  I am sorry for them because they provided valuable housing units and a good service.  They cannot dream of starting business again because they will not get finance from the banks.  While other lending institutions from outside the country will lend to them, they will do so at interest rates of 10% and 12%.  The average cost of a house in County Kerry is not &euro;400,000, &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 but between &euro;210,000 and &euro;220,000.  If builders paid an interest rate of 10%, their profit from building a house would be &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000.  Who would take on such a responsibility, especially given all the regulations builders must adhere to and the requirement to have the key turned in the door before they would be paid?<\/p> <p> Staged payments, which was how builders used to be paid, have been ruled out, which is also wrong.  An authority should be responsible for checking that a project is progressing and the works are being done to a satisfactory standard.  If problems are identified at the final stage, the final payment could be delayed.  Small builders and developers cannot start building because of the regulations in place.  The regulatory side is not working.  <\/p> <p> I will refer to a case I highlighted previously involving a young farmer who wanted to borrow &euro;100,000 from a bank to build a house.  He, his brothers and other relatives were in a position to do much of the work themselves.  Lo and behold, the bank insisted that he borrow &euro;180,000, even though his income ruled him out of accessing a loan of that size.  He is now at a standstill. <\/p> <p> Other problems have occurred on a long stretch of the N72 approaching Killarney.  Four families who had enough money to build new houses received planning permission from Kerry County Council and the council's road engineers passed their plans for road access.  Everything was fine but, lo and behold, in 2012, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, insisted that access to national secondary roads would no longer be approved.  County Kerry has more miles of national secondary road that any other county.  I have asked that this impediment be removed and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, to address the issue because the road in question is as straight as the barrel of a gun for 400 yd. in either direction.  There is no way the four families in question will be granted planning permission.  They will not be allowed to build in their own place but are supposed to move into Killarney, which is overcrowded and has no housing available.<\/p> <p> Deputies are being contacted by many people who are having their homes taken from them.  Why can the banks not do a deal with the local authorities to allow these people to lease their homes and become council tenants?  They could then purchase their homes when they get up and running.  Surely it would be easy to introduce such a mechanism given that the State has a large stakeholding in the banks.<\/p> <p> The Minister referred to the introduction of temporary, fast-track planning arrangements.  Why are the arrangements temporary?  Why does the Minister not propose to keep them in place once they are up and running?  At the current rate, we will not build enough houses in the next 20 years.  Why is the word \"temporary\" used to describe these arrangements?<\/p> <p> The Minister also stated that applications would be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As all Deputies know, An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not make decisions on planning applications for at least six months.  The organisation should be directed to respond within a quicker timeframe than six months.<\/p> <p> Reference was made to the introduction of new screening arrangements for the conduct of environmental impact assessments to streamline the process of determining planning for the consent for and subsequent undertaking of works, including emergency flood relief works, to be carried out by the Office of Public Works.  This is fine in cases where the OPW is responsible for the rivers.  In County Kerry, however, the OPW refuses to assume responsibility for even a fraction of the rivers or waterways.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, I am grateful to him for what he has tried to do for the county.<\/p> <p> One authority must deal with flooding problems.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has a say in this matter, which means people are threatened with the Garda, jail or the loss of farm payments if they go near a river.  Our rivers are clogged up and blocked for this reason.  When rivers cannot flow they flood houses and roads.  We have heard a ridiculous proposal from the OPW to create flood plains and build walls to hold back waters.  This is not the answer, which has always been to clean out the rivers and allow the waters to flow.  Time is slipping by and we will soon be into a new year.  Next year will go just as quickly or maybe even quicker than this year.  If something is not done to have one authority deal with rivers and flooding, we will be back to square one.  <\/p> <p> The Minister is a hard-working man who does his level best.  I give him that but he will have to get stuck into the Department that is responsible for the restrictions that are preventing local authorities from building houses because, as hard as he tries, his reputation is on the line. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700050#YY00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481139300,"counter":510,"content":"<p>Over the period from 2002 until 2006, the number of house completions rose each year to a peak of 88,200 in 2006.  In 2007, Ireland had the highest rate of house completions at 18 per 1,000 of population when compared with other European Union member states.  This was done with a planning system that allowed direct<\/p>  <p>public input.  The planning system did not put a brake on volumes and was obviously not an impediment to the development of housing.<\/p>  <p>  If planning permissions exist, there is no guarantee that they will deliver housing.  I can point to locations where that is the case, including in areas of high demand.  What is holding back some of those developments is the shortage of money to commence or complete them.<\/p>  <p>  The planning system can be slow, particularly when the applicant does not properly pay attention to the kind of detail needed to make a decision.  I have seen many planning applications improved by public input and the submission by the applicant of additional information at the request of the council.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the public have a vested interest in planning.  Most objections or observations are generated by those who live close to a proposed development.  They have, therefore, a vested interest by virtue of living in the locality.  This interest is generally maintained in their area long after the developer has dismantled the builder's compound and left.  Despite this, it is the members of the public who are being punished by the Bill.  They are being blamed for causing delays and more than 80% of the Bill is designed to cut them out of, or greatly limit their role in, the planning process.  The name of the Bill should be changed to the Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 because it has nothing to do with planning.<\/p>  <p>  If we want citizens to be active, as they should be in a republic, we cannot cut them out of such a vital process.  This Bill is fundamentally undemocratic and also conflicts badly<\/p>  <p>with the Aarhus Convention, to which we signed up and which gives the public the right to be consulted in a meaningful way on environmental matters that affect them.<\/p><p>There were things that could have been done to speed up the planning process, such as ensuring a sufficient number of planners, improvements to the quality of preplanning meetings, conditioning of planning decisions instead of seeking clarifications to further information, the extension of vacant sites levies and so on.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, will know if has looked at the requests for additional information that many of the issues that are highlighted therein with which the applicant has to deal often require expert input.  This will be absent because of the rush to make decisions.  Mistakes will cost communities and the Exchequer into the future.  If we do not learn from history it tends to repeat itself.  We have so much history in respect of this particular area.<\/p> <p> I live in a county where the population has quadrupled over four decades and so we have a lot of experience of development.  Many of the housing estates in the area were constructed with the benefit of what were known as \"Tully permissions\", a fast-track approach to planning permission with inadequate oversight, which resulted in short cuts being taken, the price for which was paid for not by the developers but those who live in the estates and the local authorities that ended up taking on problems that were expensive to resolve.  What we have now in terms of this Bill is \"Coveney permissions\", which will remove the local authorities from having a direct role in the planning process for the bulk of new housing estates and will sideline the public as though a disinterested nuisance seeking only to cause delays.  This will also sideline local knowledge and soft information in respect of developers who have a history of taking short cuts.<\/p> <p> The definition of what constitutes environment in respect of the Aarhus Convention is completely narrowed and, I believe, open to challenge.  The first section of the Bill deals with fast-tracking, which will fundamentally change the planning system.  The Minister is providing for guidelines to be written by himself or the Department.  He appears to be making this up as he goes along.  This Bill provides for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to pay a substantial fine to a developer from the public purse in respect of decisions not given within the specified timeframe.  The appeal process is provided for by way of judicial review, which, in effect, means there is no appeals process.  It appears also that the site notice is being dispensed with or will only be included in a guideline.  It is not clear how local authorities will deal with compliance.  Up to now the conditions set by the local authorities are included in permissions granted under appeal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The board must now decide on the substance of those conditions.  It is being asked to do so without the kind of considered expert background input that is available to local authorities in regard to roads, sanitary services, fire services, etc., from those who know the area best.  The public certainty that has been created over decades in this process is now being dispensed with.  The positive changes that have been evident in the development plan process, in particular, is being undermined as these plans can be materially contravened.  The planning process was publically understood and that brought with it a degree of public trust.  That will go.  It appears that the public will be able to make a submission to the relevant local authority but the CEO of the local authority may or not include their concerns in a summary of issues raised.  The CEO can also suggest that permission be refused but must also explain, if granted, the suggested conditions that should be imposed.<\/p> <p> Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for the taking-in-charge of estates.  This process was lengthened in subsequent legislation.  Section 180 now provides that seven years after a five-year planning permission has elapsed residents can petition to have an estate taken-in-charge.  This extension was further increased by another five years, such that this process currently takes 17 years.  Under this legislation, it is proposed to allow yet another extension of duration.  As I have often said, a person has more consumer protection when he or she buys a bag of crisps than he or she has when they buy a house.  There is nothing in this Bill that limits a developer who is dragging out this process, such that some people are confined to living on construction sites almost permanently.<\/p> <p> There are positive changes in Part 3 of the Bill in respect of residential tenancies but the Government could have gone further and sought to meet the call by Focus Ireland to legislate to ensure families in buy-to-let houses that are repossessed are not evicted.  Part 4 deals with student accommodation.  While such accommodation is definitely required the place where it is located is important, as is the relationship with the neighbouring community.  We must get this right otherwise there will be conflict.  The involvement of the Housing Finance Agency in lending for this purpose to local authorities and tier three housing associations is welcome.  The availability of finance for these sectors is likely to deliver housing units on the ground.  If the Government provided local authorities with funding to deliver local authority houses we would see more house delivery on the ground.<\/p> <p> I object to Part 5, as I have done each time I have seen in a Bill a provision to provide for the transfer of funds from the local government fund to the Minister for Finance.  This fund is made up from motor taxation and property tax.  In previous years we saw changes to the Local Government Act 1998 to allow for the transfer of up to &euro;540 million from the local government fund to the Exchequer for Irish Water.  In a previous year, approximately &euro;600 million was legislated for in the Local Government Reform Act for the same purpose.  Is it intended that the &euro;420 million that will be stripped from the local government fund will to go to the Minister for Finance or to Irish Water?  Why is this money being stripped from the local government fund?<\/p> <p> As I read this Bill, I got angrier and angrier.  It is all about planning permissions and has nothing to do with planning.  It is not about anticipating problems.  The old clich&eacute; comes to mind that if you fail to plan, you plan to fail.  I believe that this is deplorable legislation.  There is so much more that could be done to get houses built.  This legislation will result in greater lobbying of Deputies in respect of planning applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  People will be livid, and rightly so, when they discover that they have been cut out of a process into which they have a right of input.  As I said, planning permissions have been hugely improved by virtue of the input of local communities.  It is a disgrace that the public is being cut out of this process.  I do not believe that this will necessarily assist in the delivery of houses because the real impediment is the lack of funds.  Essentially what we need to do is deliver local authority houses.  That is the only thing that will help to rebalance the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700051#ZZ00200","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481139900,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Green Party also has serious concerns about the manner in which this Bill seeks to address the housing crisis.  We need to address it but we believe the measures being taken by way of this legislation are deeply flawed and may lead to a worsening planning system and housing outcome.  Our first concern is that the Bill seeks to address a problem that does not exist.  I would dispute that it is the planning system that is holding back housing development across the country.  The evidence is clear.  The Irish Planning Institute has estimated that planning permission has already been granted for 33,000 units in the Dublin area, with a further 7,000 in the planning process.  This indicates that the planning system has not failed in terms of delivering permission to build.  It is the problems in our financing and development sectors that need to be addressed.  The State also needs to start developing if we are to overcome the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  There is further evidence that this Bill seeks to address a problem that does not exist.  As I understand it, 88% of the planning applications made in the Dublin city area are approved within eight weeks.  The national average is approximately 67%.  In Dublin city, where the crisis is greatest, there is no evidence that the planning system is crucially holding up development.  If one talks to people involved in the system they frequently say that the reason a delay occurs is often because a developer submits a permission to test the waters and then subsequently makes changes to it.  It is not the local communities or local councillors who are holding things up but the developers who are submitting planning permissions which have not been fully thought through, in respect of which the communities have been consulted and are ready to go.  We all know that the key issue here in terms of the shortage of housing is the number of vacant units.<\/p><p>It just goes back to the central argument we have been making in recent weeks on the housing issue, namely, that it is all carrot to the development and construction industry and no stick.  We need a balanced approach.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Government and its predecessor did not proceed with the site value tax proposals we had set up in our time in government.  There was a problem with the immediate introduction of the tax in that the Land Registry did not have an accurate picture of who owned what.  We asked the Department of Finance to fix the problem and start doing land registration work to find out who owns what.  The process was started and I understand the work is now done.  The Minister of State may correct me on this if I am wrong.  The work would allow us to introduce a site value tax.  It would put pressure on developers across the board to use existing property and development sites in an effective and efficient way.  That would be the best planning tool.  It would be a neutral signal to the whole market that it should be efficient in the use of land and quick in development, rather than just sitting on sites that are not being used although they may be zoned correctly.<\/p> <p> With regard to targeting specifically sites that are left vacant, I cannot understand why we did not test the constitutionality of proceeding more quickly.  I would love to see a Supreme Court decision assessing whether we always have to be so cautious in looking after the needs of property owners as opposed to accounting for the public good that would arise from development.<\/p> <p> My broader concern is that this is a serious further undermining of the strength of local government.  I had the privilege to be a councillor for the Rathmines-Rathgar ward in Dublin City Council.  It was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding jobs I have done in politics.  Even since I left, powers have been taken back in respect of waste and other areas.  We are doing it here again.  The small details and changes should be noted.  The manager has to come back on any proposal related to public consultation within eight weeks.  That is fine but councillors are given only six weeks.  If the council meeting is at the wrong time, they may have no time in which to make any contribution to the process.  This undermining of our local government system is not characteristic of a clever planning approach.  We need to strengthen local government by giving councillors responsibilities and putting it up to local authorities to deliver the housing we all know is needed.  By thinking we can put councils to the side, we will continue on the approach we have taken, which involves an overly centralised system that does not result in ownership of development, particularly of our cities, which is what we need to get right.  If there is no ownership at local council level and councillors are not involved in the process from the start, even if one is giving permission for big developments, how can we get the other parts of the jigsaw right?<\/p> <p> Senators Grace O'Sullivan, Alice-Mary Higgins and Victor Boyhan and other colleagues in the Seanad tabled a number of very valuable amendments to the legislation.  We seek to make it better in the process.  I hope the Minister of State will be open to accepting amendments and will listen to those with a real interest and experience in how local government and housing works.  It is not opposition for the sake of it here; we are speaking out of the deep desire to get housing and planning right.  I do not believe this Bill takes us in the right direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700052#AAA00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481140500,"counter":514,"content":"<p>In the short time available to me, I will address in the main the residential tenancy aspects of the Bill.  The Bill is a pretence.  It purports to give protection to tenants when properties in which there are existing tenants change ownership.  Cruelly and grotesquely, it provides that where a landlord can get 20% more money with vacant possession in the sale, the tenants must leave.  It also provides that if apartments are sold in lots of under 20, the tenants have to go.  I understand that this number has been reduced to under five by a Seanad amendment.  However, 80% of tenants evicted from apartments are evicted by landlords with under five rental properties.  In a word, the Bill continues the cruel system under which tenants are evicted when rental properties are sold.  The Government continues to put the rights of property owners over the right to home.  It is fast-tracking evictions in the Courts Bill, which is also before this House.  The largest single group among the homeless has previously been in private rented accommodation.  This Bill will ensure that this continues.<\/p>  <p>  I will be proposing the amendment suggested by Focus Ireland, the homelessness charity.  The amendment provides tenants in buy-to-let properties will continue in residence despite the sale of the property in all circumstances.  Focus Ireland, the leading charity working with homeless families and those facing homelessness, says up to 20 families are becoming homeless each month simply because their buy-to-let landlord has been forced to sell by his or her bank.  This means that 40 children every month are losing their homes and joining the record 1,200 families who are already homeless across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Along with escalating rents, these evictions are one of the leading causes of family homelessness.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, more families waiting to face the same trauma.  According to the Central Bank, there are a further 15,000 buy-to-let mortgages that are more than two years in arrears.  Whether they know it or not, all tenants in these properties are at risk of eviction.  Other countries have found solutions to this.  Just up the road, in the North, banks that repossess a buy-to-let property are prohibited from evicting the tenant.  We must do the same.  If the Focus Ireland amendment is passed, the grotesque escape clauses in this Bill enabling eviction of buy-to-let tenants will fall.<\/p>  <p>  I will also be proposing the formal declaration of a housing emergency by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This would put the right of families to a home above the property rights of vultures and other landlords.  Landlords and the Minister for Finance would then be unable to block a halt to convictions and be unable to block a halt to rent freezes by citing a qualified right to private property in the Constitution, which is of course subject to the public good.  The Government itself has formally certified the continuation of a financial emergency as recently as June of this year to enable it to continue with pay and pension cuts under FEMPI legislation.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has said that a housing emergency exists.  My amendment would formally declare that to be the case.  The Taoiseach has asked the European Union to relax the provisions of the EU fiscal treaty to enable borrowing to build social housing but he has not declared a formal housing emergency at home.  Of course, the European Union knows the Irish Government is only going through the motions because a housing emergency has not been declared.  I noted over the weekend that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, called on the European Union to give flexibility under the fiscal treaty at the EU Finance Ministers' meeting.  He and the rest of the Government can now show they are serious by formally declaring the housing emergency.  It is time for an end to pretence and hypocrisy.  We must halt evictions for mortgaged and rented properties as a first step in tackling the housing emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700053#BBB00200","speaker":"1348"},{"type":"speech","time":1481140500,"counter":515,"content":"<p>N&iacute;l aon tinte&aacute;n mar do thinte&aacute;n f&eacute;in.  This old Irish adage means that there is no home like one's own home.  It is particularly pertinent at this time of the year.  As far as I am concerned, there is nothing more emotionally affecting in this job than a constituent who makes contact with one desperately seeking help to find a home or put a roof over his or her head and the heads of his or her family.  There are too many people in this country who cannot find suitable, affordable housing, and there are too many under constant strain, not knowing where they and their family will be living for the foreseeable future.  We have a crisis on our hands.  That much is clear but the Government has a plan to deal with it and rebuild Ireland.  This Bill will help to put the plan into action.  We have identified the tackling of the housing crisis as our top priority in office.  We have a Minister who takes his portfolio very seriously.  The Rebuilding Ireland policy document has been widely heralded as the most comprehensive strategy to ensure housing supply that a Government has ever produced in this country.  We know the five pillars: address homelessness, accelerate social housing, build homes, improve the rental sector, and utilise existing housing stock.  Therefore, I am very happy to see this Bill brought before the D&aacute;il.   It will facilitate the implementation of the strategy and help Ireland build more homes in the long term.<\/p>  <p>  There is clearly a problem with the housing market, however.  This has been identified and it is being addressed by the Government.<\/p><p>Ultimately, we need more houses.  For those who cannot afford suitable housing in this inflationary market, they need this problem to be addressed immediately.  Long-term strategies are well and good, but people need homes now.  Therefore, it is heartening that the Government is introducing this Bill which will allow for the rapid delivery of major housing projects and puts the vision of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy into practice.  Since the Bill will go a long way towards addressing an urgent need, I am happy to support it, although I have some concerns that I will mention.<\/p> <p> We are already seeing the Government's efforts beginning to bear fruit.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's figures show an annual increase of one third in the number of houses being built in the first nine months of 2016.  In combination with the launch of the help-to-buy scheme in the budget, this is a major achievement for the Government.  The Bill will allow fast-track decision-making processes, which a number of Deputies have alluded to, build on current successes and facilitate the delivery of more homes at an accelerated pace.  The Bill will allow the Government to reach its ambitious targets to increase the annual number of homes built to 25,000 while delivering 47,000 homes through social housing.  It will help to accelerate further the building and delivery of the affordable homes that we urgently need.<\/p> <p> In my constituency of Dublin Rathdown, I recently attended the official opening of Cromlech Close with the Minister.  In the Kiltiernan-Glenamuck area of my constituency, the Government is in the process of delivering 2,000 much needed, quality homes through D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.<\/p> <p> I have some concerns over the nature of the process to be employed in the Bill's implementation.  We need to deliver affordable homes and the Bill will allow us to do so at an accelerated pace.  However, it is important that local concerns are not neglected.  This matter has been mentioned by a number of Deputies.  The bypassing of local authorities to fast-track the process has caused concern for a number of constituents and residents' associations that have contacted me.  There is a number of sites in Dublin Rathdown where D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's local expertise is seen by many as invaluable in ensuring that local needs are met in the making of planning decisions.  For example, we are in need of facilities to care for older people in Dublin Rathdown, but D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was able to apply its local knowledge and expertise to reject recent plans to develop a nursing home at the Badger's Glen site that would not have been fit for purpose.  I will outline the reasons.<\/p> <p> Similar concerns have been voiced about developments on Deerpark Road and elsewhere in Mount Merrion where residents are concerned that proposed developments, such as that of the Union Caf&eacute;, will significantly alter the character of their community.  The lack of parking, recreational areas, sewerage, water pressure, open spaces and emergency access must be taken into account.  Such developments are not feasible.<\/p> <p> We need more homes, particularly in Dublin, but it is important that we bear in mind the needs of existing residents and communities when planning new housing developments.  A balance must be struck between providing homes on the one hand and overdevelopment or overcommercialisation on the other.  Urban environments do not have the dispersed settlements that planners have available to them in rural communities.<\/p> <p> I am encouraged by how the Bill provides for a nine-week mandatory pre-application consultation involving the local area planning authority, whereby there will be consultation with local authorities.  The Minister of State should ensure that this is communicated adequately.  Local authorities will continue to have a role in the planning of large housing projects.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister of State reassure my constituents and me that local knowledge will be taken into account in the fast-track process envisioned by the Bill and that local concerns will be duly considered, particularly in urban areas?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700053#BBB00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481141100,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this debate.  Everybody from both sides of the D&aacute;il recognises there is a housing crisis.  To put it simply, there is a lack of housing stock, be it new or second-hand.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has made excellent progress to date and is the first to admit that much more needs to be done.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has a number of main provisions, including more fast-tracked planning in respect of certain developments, a further extension of existing planning permissions, amendments to Part VIII in respect of local authority-owned land, changes to the requirements for an environmental impact assessment on proposed developments, amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2015 and making provision for the Housing Finance Agency to lend to higher education institutes for the purpose of providing student accommodation.  I wish to address each of these provisions individually.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the proposals on fast-track planning in respect of certain developments.  As matters stand, the majority of large housing planning applications are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It makes sense that, in order to accelerate the process, these planning applications should go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Instead of there being a two-stage process, there will be a single-stage one.  In real terms, the Department estimates that the total process of obtaining planning permission can be reduced from 77 weeks to 25.  This will be a major improvement and will factor into houses being brought to market more quickly.  Some stakeholders have reservations about this provision.  However, if the planning process is streamlined, it will be to the overall benefit of all involved.<\/p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland strategy committed to extending certain planning permissions that had already benefitted from one extension for a further period.  The Bill's second provision tackles this commitment in respect of permissions already granted for 20 or more housing units.  This provision will facilitate the early delivery of housing by removing the requirement for a developer to re-enter the planning process.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill will further fast-track the delivery of housing units through the amendments to Part VIII in respect of local authority owned developments.  The new provisions will mean that a local authority's own development proposal will take place at a maximum of 20 weeks from the time of public consultation.  This provision will make the process more efficient, with the net effect being housing units delivered more quickly.<\/p>  <p>  On a recent visit to Dundalk, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I met the CEO of Louth County Council, Ms Joan Martin, and members of her staff.  During that meeting, she outlined the situation in Louth.  There are 710 vacant properties in Dundalk and a further 758 vacant properties in Drogheda.  An innovative pilot scheme developed by the council under the guidance of Mr. Joe McGuinness, director of services, has already seen approval for 24 vacant properties acquired under compulsory purchase orders.  Of those, two have been allocated to tenants, seven are being reburbished and 15 are at survey and tender stage.  I have been calling for this innovative approach for the past eight months and I am delighted that it has proven so successful.  Surely the nearly 1,500 vacant properties in County Louth present an opportunity to reduce the housing list with ready-made homes in established neighbourhoods.<\/p>  <p>  During our meeting with Louth County Council, it was outlined that it had the potential to deliver more than 3,300 housing units under the local infrastructure housing activation fund.  These units are planned to be delivered in Newtown and the northern environs of Drogheda and Mount Avenue in Dundalk.  Louth County Council has 25 schemes at various stages of approval that will deliver almost 550 housing units in the next three to four years.  The council has other substantial lands, but significant loans are attached to them.  This issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The Minister is supportive of innovative solutions, possibly including a public private partnership, in order to free up the lands and the corresponding debts attached to them while delivering much needed housing stock.<\/p>  <p>  The next provision in the Bill that I wish to comment on is the new screening arrangement for certain types of works to determine whether environmental impact assessments need to be carried out.  The Bill provides that an application can be made to the planning authority, before making a planning application, on whether a proposed development is likely to have a significant effect on the environment.  The main benefit of this provision is that we would be in a position to fast-track planning applications and as a result deliver much needed housing immediately.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts are ones that I welcome with caution.  The measures to provide more security to tenants are welcome.  We must prevent a situation whereby large numbers of tenants in a single development are evicted at the same time, such as happened in Tyrrelstown this year.  We must protect tenants more.  We need to extend the definition of \"landlord\" to include receivers and lenders in respect of the repossession of a property.  A tenant should not lose his or her basic rights just because the landlord is in financial difficulty.<\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the provisions to improve the operation of the Residential Tenancies Board.<\/p><p>The speeding up of the dispute resolution timeframe, the reduction in the number of members on tribunals and the restructuring of the administration process will improve the experience of those in the private rented sector, including tenants and landlords.  One area about which I am concerned relates to the amendment to allow an order of possession to be made by the District Court.  I am concerned that this will simply lead to a speeding up the process of securing the vacation of dwellings.  We must protect the people who will be subject to those provisions.  I propose that a robust system be put in place to protect those who are affected.  For example, a protocol that would allow information to be shared between the Residential Tenancies Board and local authorities could be introduced in order that local authorities would be alerted when tenants do not vacate properties due to the fact that they have not secured alternative accommodation.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, the Department acknowledged this scenario and indicated that it would examine all possibilities.<\/p> <p> I wish to briefly comment on the proposed new provisions relating to the Housing Finance Agency.  I welcome the fact that it will be able to lend to higher education institutes for the purpose of providing student accommodation.  Institute of technologies, such as the Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, will now be able to access low-cost funding for the purpose of student accommodation and that will have the knock-on effect of freeing up valuable housing stock in places such as Dundalk.<\/p> <p> I thank the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the efforts he has made to date in tackling the housing crisis.  It will not be solved overnight but I firmly believe that the plans he has and the actions taken to date will go a long way towards solving the housing crisis, which came about as a result of the disastrous economic policies of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700054#CCC00200","speaker":"1331","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481141700,"counter":519,"content":"<p>Before commenting on the Bill, I wish to raise a couple of issues.  One of these relates to planning permission, in particular for people who want the opportunity to protect their properties.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, has just left the Chamber.  I live in County Wexford, a constituency with a substantial soft shoreline.  People there are losing their properties, which are falling into the sea, but because the area is a special area of conservation, SAC, or natural heritage area, NHA, the National Parks and Wildlife Service prevents them from protecting their property.  This is a real problem and something should be done about it because the situation is unfair.  I must speak to the Minister of State about Kilpatrick in north Wexford where some people have had their access routes washed into the sea.  They cannot gain access to their own property and they are relying on the generosity of neighbours who allow them to drive 4X4s across their gardens.  They are prevented from doing anything about the situation, which is particularly unfair.  The Bill could allow people to facilitate emergency works to protect their properties.<\/p>  <p>  In the time available, I wish to focus on affordable housing.  Previous speakers referred to those who have the capacity to purchase houses but cannot do so because properties are too expensive and to people who are in the social housing spectrum.  The large numbers of people who occupy the middle ground appear to have been forgotten.  The average industrial wage is &euro;33,000 and when one factors it up by 3.5 times in the manner specified by the Central Bank, the total amount is &euro;100,000.  People on that level of income have no prospect of buying a house.  They are left to rent forever.  It is a large coterie of people.  If one adds a second person on a similar income and factors up the numbers, one arrives at a total of approximately &euro;175,000.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland puts the cost of building a standard three-bed semi-detached house in Dublin at &euro;330,000.  The numbers do not add up.  We must do something about this matter, particularly in the context of the coterie of people in question.<\/p>  <p>  I do not wish to repeat what others have said.  I am determined that we do not ignore the people to whom I refer, who should be given the opportunity to purchase their own properties.  In the past, local authorities very successfully provided sites for them.  The charge for the site was &euro;5,000 and then the local authority went to the market and got a house built for X amount.  It is possible in areas outside Dublin to get a house built for &euro;170,000.  We might have to reduce the size of the house but that is possible because families are not as big as they used to be.  I am not talking about reducing the quality or design of homes.  In the past, the average home was 1,100 sq. ft. for families with three or four children.  There is nothing wrong with reducing the size of such a property to 900 sq. ft. for families comprising two adults and two children.  There would be a reduction in cost commensurate with the reduction in size.  We should consider taking such an approach.  Nobody should take what I say to mean that I am advocating a reduction in standards of house building.  I refer to houses that are well-designed internationally.  A house of 900 sq. ft. is big enough for a family of three.  The alternative is not to give them an opportunity to ever purchase, which would be wrong.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I am so determined in respect of this issue is because we have left those people behind.  There is nothing in the plan to help them to obtain affordable housing.  Given that the average industrial wage is &euro;33,000, we could provide houses for &euro;175,000, which would include the site and which would make housing affordable for the group of which I speak by reducing the levies and the tax take of the State from a property.  The calculation at present is that the State takes 35% in tax on a property.  I do not believe those who need a property most should pay the same level as those who are capable of buying their own property.  The State could intervene in a very positive way.  I gave a paper to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but it was not acted upon.  The Bill provides an opportunity for the Minister to act and I would be most grateful if the proposal could be considered.<\/p>  <p>  One other issue I wish to raise - it was also raised in the Seanad - relates to properties with existing planning permissions.  A very valid point was made about allowing planning permissions to be extended whereby people could sit on them and allow the market to increase and then take the opportunity to get a larger profit by selling their properties.  That is not what I am talking about.  Some developers are not in a position to get money from the banks in order to build.  In cases where sites are paid for, banks are giving approximately 60% and the remaining 40% comes from own funds or equity funds, which charge 15% interest.  Many developers are not prepared to build because the margin is too low.  What I am calling for is an extension of planning permissions in order to allow developers to get access to funding that might not be available now.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister to consider situations where planning permission has been given for the development of a single house.  If those permissions are still live, I am of the view that they should be extended for another two to three years.  That should be done.  We do not need planning applications to reduce in number or to run out of time, which can very easily happen.  What I am suggesting was done in previous planning legislation and it could be done in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to consider that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700055#DDD00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1481141700,"counter":520,"content":"<p>I wish to share time with Deputies Haughey and Eugene Murphy.

We must look at what is happening in the courts.  I am delighted that the Courts Bill 2016 has been somewhat derailed in terms of the change of jurisdiction from the High Court to the Circuit Court because all the Bill will do is speed up evictions, including those relating to buy-to-let properties.  The latter are still people&rsquo;s homes.  We heard earlier that those people should be protected.  We must start at the beginning and protect people in their own homes.  The Circuit Court and the county registrar&rsquo;s list are simply not working.  They are not fit for purpose.  They take no consideration whatsoever of individual families that will lose their homes.  They constantly bring them back, either before the registrar or the Circuit Court and they continue the trauma and damage that is being done to families in this country by threatening their homes and by allowing the banks to continue to threaten them.<\/p><p>The local authority does not have the means to respond to the numbers being threatened with repossession.  We should stop it through legislation and prevent families from losing their homes.  We did it with all of the larger accounts and transferred them to NAMA.  Why can we not set up some sort of agency that will take over the mortgages that have gone wrong, keep people in their homes and allow them to work it out?  Why do we allow vulture funds to come in here, clean up on our tax arrangements and, again, threaten small businesses and families in their properties?  It is not acceptable.  We are crying crocodile tears in respect of this Bill if we do not address the kernel of the problem, which is what I have just outlined.  <\/p> <p> Alongside that problem, there are those homes that have been repossessed by the banks.  I think the number is somewhere in the region of 400 for Bank of Ireland, mainly centred around Dublin, all of which are empty.  Ulster Bank has repossessed somewhere in the region of 500.  Again, they are all still empty.  If we have a housing crisis, why are the banks allowed to leave those houses empty without enabling the local authorities or the voluntary sector to purchase those houses and to put tenants into them who are waiting to get a roof over their heads?  It is simply a crazy situation.  We are told by AIB that next year, it will have about 6,000 cases that will be coming down the line in respect of repossession.  Bank of Ireland has told us that the repossession cases will increase dramatically in 2017.  This Bill is looking at the process to allow planning permission to be granted more quickly.  Have we learned nothing from Irish Water or the HSE?  The minute there is a problem, we think of something major like a major agency - another quango - or more legislation to deal with the problems.  Why do we not look back to the county councils?  I have listened carefully to every speaker here.  All of them have complimented their own councils, identified sites and asked for action on them.  The only thing that is short in respect of the delivery of housing by councils is the fact they do not have the money.  <\/p> <p> The council lists are being massaged.  There are those who cannot go on the list but who cannot raise a loan.  In my opinion, they are in need of housing.  There are those on the HAP scheme who are thrown to some ruthless landlords who will not look after their property.  There are those on the RAS scheme or rent allowance who suffer the same plight, are facing no standards and poor accommodation and are wondering when they will have secure accommodation.  <\/p> <p> Like others here this evening, I can pick out three different sites in my constituency that would adequately house homes and care for the elderly.  Those sites are owned by the HSE.  There are existing buildings on those sites that could be refurbished and re-presented as living units within a setting that provides care for the elderly.  There are vacant houses in counties nationwide that for some reason, councils fail to bring to the letting stage because of some notion that they need all sorts of things done with them.  I have seen vacant houses in my constituency that were vacated for some reason or other but are ready to live in and yet the local authority will board them up and allow them to be damaged beyond belief when it will cost a fortune to repair them and not let them.  Somebody has to ask them why because every county has a chief executive officer.  These people are paid well and have enough staff and yet they do not deliver in the context of the crisis we face.  We can look to the banks for a solution to some of these problems because they have the houses.  We can look to the courts and the legislation surrounding that to keep people in their houses.  It is my firm belief that if we insist that county managers, or CEOs as they are now known, do their job, we will have sites that will be developed.  <\/p> <p> My fear about this Bill and An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that it bypasses local input from councillors and people who know how these developments can happen.  There is nothing that can replace local knowledge.  We must ensure the development of houses fits into the area for which it is planned, that it does not infringe on the rights of other residents in that area in respect of size and dimension of the properties and that we have good planning.  There is no better way to safeguard that than to have it locally focused.  The danger is we will now attempt to reduce the size of apartments or else build them to the minimum standard that is required.  It will be up to councils and community activists to ensure the future tenants of these properties are protected because there is nothing as bad as imposing a development for quite a number of houses on an existing site in a city or urban area where there are no facilities.  All the discussions I have heard have centred around the provision of housing.  We must be extremely careful about the quality of those houses and the manner in which they are planned and there must be council input into those housing proposals.  There is nothing strange about that.  If you look back to the 1950s when most of the local authority houses were built, they were built well, were provided with green areas and were accessible to urban areas and they worked.  Many large families were reared in three-bedroom houses.  Many parents had 11 children in a three-bedroom local authority house.  We have to go back to arranging our construction and the delivery of houses around the sensible notion that you can have houses built by local authorities in the local area and put through the local councils with the local councils being made responsible for them.  What is so wrong with that?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700055#DDD00500","speaker":"1248","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481142300,"counter":524,"content":"<p>A key feature of this Bill is the introduction on a temporary basis of a fast-track planning procedure for residential developments of 100 units or more.  This would allow for applications of such developments to be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is believed that this change will lead to a substantial reduction in the length of time for the completion of the approval process for large-scale housing developments.  In practice, the vast majority of large housing planning applications are already appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which has been making the final decisions on these proposals.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to recognise that under this Bill, members of the public can still make submissions relating to large housing developments.  During the mandatory nine-week pre-application consultation period, members of the public can raise concerns with their local authority.  If a member of the public makes an observation at this stage, the ordinary charge of &euro;20 will still apply.  I hope I am reading this correctly.  <\/p>  <p>  It is to be hoped that the board will have the capacity to deal with the additional planning applications and meet the 16-week statutory guidelines for disposing of applications during the consultation phase, as outlined in this Bill.  I raise this issue because staffing levels at An Bord Plean&aacute;la are approximately 25% below 2008 levels and its income is 22% less than it was eight years ago.  However, Fianna F&aacute;il supports this change as one of a series of measures which are necessary to drive the much needed increase in housing supply. <\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Last year 12,666 new homes were completed in the State.  This highlights the extent of the current supply shortage when we consider that the ESRI has estimated that in the coming years an increase in output to a minimum of 25,000 new home completions per annum is required to meet demand.<\/p> <p> The absence of an adequate supply has led to significant increases in house and rent prices, thus placing considerable pressure on the living standards of households throughout the country.  In this regard I welcome the commitment in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan to deliver an average of 25,000 units per annum over the period of the plan.<\/p> <p> While Rebuilding Ireland begins to grasp the scale of the housing emergency, ultimately the Government will be judged on its ability to deliver on the commitments set out in the action plan.  The lack of supply has had significant implications for the private rental market which has seen substantial price increases in recent years.  As a result many individuals and families on modest incomes have struggled to meet the cost of rental accommodation.  This has led to a changing profile of those presenting as homeless with many households that would normally have their accommodation needs met through the private rental sector at risk of homelessness.<\/p> <p> In respect of the rental sector, I welcome that the Bill provides for an enhanced role for the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  It is to be hoped that the expanded powers for the board will facilitate an accelerated resolution process in instances of disputes between landlords and tenants.<\/p> <p> In the last two decades the rental sector has become an increasingly important element of the Irish housing system.  At a national level, 20% of households are renting from a private landlord.  However, at 34%, the percentage of households renting in Dublin is considerably higher than the national figure.  In the view of a number of experts, an effective housing system depends on a larger role for the rental sector into the future.  This must be based on greater affordability and security of occupancy for tenants.  I hope the Government's rental strategy to be announced next week provides a clear roadmap in this direction.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has repeatedly stated that rent inflation in Dublin and other urban centres is severely impacting on disposable incomes, pushing people into homelessness and posing a risk to our economic stability and competitiveness.  Therefore, rent certainty measures are required to reduce the unsustainable rent inflation of recent years and increase security of occupancy for tenants.  The Fianna F&aacute;il policy on rent certainty centres on a rental index based on a five-year historical average of rents in each local authority area.  This would help to prevent the excessive rent inflation that we have seen in recent years.<\/p> <p> Some of the recent proposals on rent certainty made in the D&aacute;il, albeit aimed at increasing security, would likely have the effect of discouraging supply.  It is important that any measures to increase rent certainty are sensitive to some of the rather particular features of the Irish rental market.  These include the preponderance of landlords who own a small number of properties and the considerable amount of encumbered buy-to-let mortgages among such landlords.<\/p> <p> It is important that measures aimed at increasing security of occupancy for tenants do not undermine efforts to expand the supply of rental properties.  In a report published last year, the National Economic and Social Council suggested that making mortgage interest fully tax deductible when rental income is being calculated could encourage the increased supply of private rental accommodation and enhance security of occupancy by incentivising landlords to offer long-term or indefinite leasing arrangements.<\/p> <p> Given that the housing emergency is in large part a problem of inadequate supply, it is essential that there is a considerable increase in social housing provided by local authorities and approved housing bodies as we have done in the past.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay North, the effect of this inadequate supply is apparent from the fact that there are over 6,000 applicants on the waiting list for social housing.<\/p> <p> There have been some crucial changes in the profile of housing provision in recent decades which have important implications for the current crisis.  In 1975 a considerable proportion of the overall housing completions, 33%, came in the form of social housing provided directly by local authorities with the remaining 67% delivered by the private market.  By 2005 there had been a substantial shift away from social housing provision, with the private market accounting for 93% of overall housing delivery.<\/p> <p> In this environment it is unsurprising that the Irish Council for Social Housing has stated that social housing stock in Ireland, at 9% of overall stock, is low compared with the EU average of 17%.  A lack of building by local authorities, combined with an over-reliance on provision by the private sector, has contributed to the current shortage of supply.  In this context, I welcome the commitment in the Government action plan to provide 47,000 units for social housing between now and 2021.  This will see local authorities partaking in substantial social housing construction for the first time in a number of years.<\/p> <p> Given the reduced social housing output in recent times, it is encouraging that there is a renewed acceptance that providing housing for those in need is one of the State's most basic responsibilities.  However, in light of the very limited output on the part of local authorities over recent years, additional staffing and expertise may be required to drive the substantial increase in output.<\/p> <p> The Bill gives legislative effect to a number of the key proposals contained in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan which was published earlier this year.  While I welcome many of these measures, ultimately the Government will be judged on its ability to deliver on the commitments set out in its plan.  It is incumbent on elected representatives across the political spectrum to vigorously pursue solutions to the current housing emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700056#EEE00200","speaker":"1360","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481142900,"counter":526,"content":"<p>I know that my time is limited, but I appreciate Deputies Haughey and McGuinness giving me some time on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  Santa Claus is just around the corner, but sadly many children are worried about whether he will know where to come this year.  That is because so many families are living in hostels and hotels.  We all know that Santa will know where to come, because he is the master of everything.<\/p>  <p>  It is unbelievable that in this day and age we cannot bring some sanity to this situation.  As Deputy McGuinness said, when the country had far less we could solve problems far better.  I do not believe the provisions of the Bill will solve any problems.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and everybody else genuinely want to solve this and are working hard to try to do so.  However, I do not believe fast-tracking house builds will work.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency many houses have been vacant for a long period.  I do not understand why banks take families to court to put them out of houses, and two or three years later the houses are falling into disrepair.  We have people on housing lists everywhere and families put out on the roadside and having to get accommodation through the local authority.  I do not believe this fast-tracking will work.  At the end of the day we will have to go back to the local authorities and let them do what they used to do over the years, namely, build the houses and house people in them.<\/p>  <p>  I think the Minister of State, Deputy English, will agree that planning in rural areas is becoming very prohibitive.  I will give one example.  I know a couple in their late 50s living in an old two-storey house.  Because of rules and regulations laid down by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in recent years, those people who now want to replace that house with a bungalow on the same site are not allow to do so.  At this stage in their lives it makes sense for them, but they are not allowed to do it.  These are the types of situations that arise.  We cannot allow them to develop and must nip them in the bud.  That type of prohibitive planning does not help the situation at all.<\/p>  <p>  I have much more to say about flooding, etc., but I will have to avail of another opportunity to do that.  I again thank my colleagues for sharing their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700057#FFF00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1481142900,"counter":527,"content":"<p>T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.  In general we welcome some aspects of the Bill and what it attempts to do.  For example, Part 2 Chapter 3 of the Bill, dealing with miscellaneous constructions and amendments to the Planning and Development Act, allows for streamlining of existing arrangements for approval by local authorities of their own development proposals, including proposals for social housing projects and infrastructure servicing for both public and private developments.<\/p><p>We welcome this aspect.  The strengthening of the Part 8 planning process used by the local authorities for council housing will prevent planning delays.  We have, however, concerns about tampering with the planning process to speed up so called delivery.  Consultation and pre-planning should be four to six weeks and this Bill will bypass the planning process.  Part 2 of the Bill, relating to planning and the development of strategic housing developments, will introduce a fast-track planning procedure for residential developments of 100 units or more and for large-scale student accommodation projects of 200 or more bed spaces.  This proposal to fast-track private planning developments by bypassing local authorities and going straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a profound change to our planning system.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not the same as a local authority.  The inclusion of a greater use of pre-planning engagement with local communities and residents is essential.  My colleague, Deputy Eoin &Oacute; Broin, said in the House last week that the Government has not provided an evidence base for this proposal, nor has it demonstrated that the move will not undermine good planning and further alienate communities from the planning process.  The problem with this provision is that it appears the Government is tampering with planning law in order to facilitate a few developments in certain areas.<\/p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill proposes an amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 but this does not go far enough and an opportunity was missed.  Sinn F&eacute;in has categorically stated many times that the Minister missed an opportunity to amend the Bill and insert rent certainty provisions.  The provisions contained in the Bill are weak.  Couples and families who are working in good jobs come into my office in Dublin north west, yet they cannot afford to keep up with rent increases at the moment and are now in danger of becoming homeless.  The consequences of these continual rent increases are not trivial and affect everyone who is dependent on the private rental sector for accommodation - the middle income working families who cannot afford to save to buy a home, the low income families who are paying up to 60% of their disposable income on rent and the students whose numbers increase every year - with fewer properties available to meet this growth.  The situation is such that many parents have to decide between paying rent and covering increasing back to school costs.  In some cases, families are being made homeless because of an inability to pay the rising rents or to secure rental accommodation.<\/p> <p> With the number of children now in emergency accommodation, it is clear that household poverty is increasing.  The Government must recognise that rent certainty is key to alleviating the pressure on these households.  Sinn F&eacute;in brought forward a Bill last week that would have provided rent certainty for landlords and tenants alike but this was rejected by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael parties.  Our Bill would have linked rent increases and decreases to the consumer price index, which would have provided some stability for the market.  The Government&rsquo;s housing action plan offers little hope for those in the private rental sector, other than a vague pledge to commission a White Paper to be included in the plan.  For example, the proposal to strengthen tenants' rights in developments of more than five units - the Tyrrelstown amendment - is weak.  The overwhelming majority of those living in the private rented sector will not benefit from this change.  This means that those families at risk of homelessness due to buy-to-let properties being repossessed by the banks will continue to be at risk of homelessness.  The tenants who are managing to pay these high rent prices have little or no security of tenure.  As it stands, the property can be sold from under them at the whim of the landlord.  A report by the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, on local authority inspections of rented accommodation shows that 55% of properties inspected were substandard.  The sale of any rented property should not lead to the termination of a tenancy.  Section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act should be reviewed to remove sale as a justification for the termination of a tenancy in any case where the property is in the ownership of an institutional landlord or where the landlord in question works as a property professional.  The strengthening of the powers of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, is welcome as long as it is properly resourced to carry out the additional functions as required.<\/p> <p> Last year, the previous Government promised to deliver 500 rapid build housing units with 134 of them to be built before last Christmas.  Unfortunately, we have only got 22 so far this year and we are told more will be delivered throughout this coming year.  While I accept that will happen, it is at far too slow a rate.  I know problems are being encountered with communities and objections and all sorts of problems being thrown at us, but we must be ready for them and overcome them.  The cost of the 22 units in Ballymun, at approximately &euro;205,000 each, excluded the cost of the land which belonged to the local authority.  Underground services were also available there.  The cost of those rapid builds was way over the top and we could have built ordinary houses, although I will not dispute that rapid build houses are a very high standard.  The rapid build houses we are about to build - some have started in Cherry Orchard and in Finglas  - cannot be delivered quick enough.  It certainly is very slow.  We will not have them available until the second quarter of next year.<\/p> <p> We are in an emergency with 130,000 people on the housing waiting lists, almost 6,400 people who are homeless and over 2,000 children living in hotels without cooking facilities.  They are in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation.  They have nowhere to go.  Many of them must leave their accommodation in the morning and come back in the evening.  We have chaos when it comes to families.  Children's rights should be protected much more.  It is an example of how we have let our children down.  They have had to manage in hotels, with no rooms of their own and no place to play.  They are literally under a curfew in many of these hotels.<\/p> <p>Homeless people are still dying on the streets.  The last Government promised that the homeless crisis would be totally solved in 2016.  We now have a massive crisis which is even worse and it is, unfortunately, getting worse and but for the volunteers out there, delivering meals and looking after the homeless on our streets, there is absolutely no doubt that we would have even more deaths on our streets.  Single males and females who are now on the Dublin City Council waiting list will be looking at waiting for ten or 15 years to get a place.  It is just impossible now for a single person on the housing list, never mind the families who are on the list.  Some people with large families are being told they could be ten or 15 years on the housing waiting list.  This is how bad the crisis has become and how bad it is hitting our society.  We judge a society by how we look after our people and house them.  We are not doing it and it is not working.  Something radical is missing in the approach of this and the previous Government.<\/p> <p> With regard to local authorities and the fast-track planning process, revenue will be lost to local authorities by fast-tracking, doing away with the local authority process and going straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes a decision that needs judicial review, what citizen can do that?  They would not have the money to access the judicial review process and this is what we are talking about.  That is the only point in the process that would be left to them.  The Minister of State has said that these measures would end up being temporary, but it is very clear that they could end up being permanent.  We are in such a crisis now that it is going to continue into the foreseeable future.<\/p><p>We will end up with a permanent system that has been messed around and a planning process that has been changed.  It would not be to the benefit of many cases to tamper with planning permission.<\/p> <p> One of the biggest issues we have when dealing with housing is the procurement process, which needs to be accountable and speeded up.  We need to find a mechanism to speed up the entire procurement process.  The State needs to build social and affordable housing.  We constantly rely on the private sector, which is where our downfall is at present.  We are waiting for it to come up with the 10% under Part V.  We will never get on top of the crisis while we are dependent on the private sector.  It is possible to look at a situation where the State hires companies or building firms to build social housing and pays them a fee to do so.  This is a possible way to look at it but we need to get down to build the houses ourselves.<\/p> <p> The aim of the Bill is to speed up the planning process, but tampering with planning, particularly when it comes to local authorities, is dangerous and we need to be very careful about this.  I am disappointed that Part V has not been mentioned and we have not revisited it with regard to the 10%.  Previously we had a provision for 20% social and affordable housing.  There were other provisions with which I did not agree, and I welcome the changes in other areas, but while there is flexibility in this regard, 10% is a very low starting point.  We need to get real.  We have an emergency and it is not getting any better.  It is quite obvious that it is continuing, and despite all the measures put in place by the Government, we still have a serious emergency.<\/p> <p> While we oppose the Bill in its current form, and we will table a large number of amendments, we accept there are good measures in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700057#FFF00300","speaker":"1303","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481144100,"counter":530,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, the country was horrified at the mass evictions attempted by a vulture fund at Tyrrelstown in Dublin and a receiver at the Eden estate in Cork city.  One of the stated aims of the Bill is to prevent this from happening again, and a section of the Bill is becoming known as the Tyrrelstown amendment.  The Bill's original proposal was to reduce the maximum number of evictions that a landlord could carry out at one time to 19.  When the Bill was debated in the Seanad, three Senators, Senators Colette Kelleher, Lynn Ruane and Alice-Mary Higgins, tabled an amendment which was carried, which reduced the figure from 19 to five.  Press reports seem to indicate the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is not satisfied with this and is considering proposing on Committee or Report Stage that the number be increased from five, perhaps to ten.  He is quoted in the press as saying in this regard that he does not believe we should try to bring small landlords into the category because it would disincentivise people staying in the landlord market if we do so.  The Anti-Austerity Alliance believes the amendment proposed by the Opposition Senators was a modest proposal because 70% of tenants in the State live in properties owned by a landlord with four properties or fewer and would receive no protection from the measure.<\/p>  <p>  Next week, we will move First Stage of a Bill to come before the House on Second Stage in January, entitled the anti-eviction Bill.  The Bill will contain a proposal to outlaw sale as a grounds for eviction.  Of course the landlord should have the right to sell a property, but with our Bill the tenancy as well as the ownership of the property will have to be transferred.  Our anti-eviction Bill will also provide for the circumstance where a landlord states he or she needs vacant possession of the property in order that a relative might move in or move back in.  To deter abuse of this reason for demanding vacant possession, the Bill will state this can and should only be done if six months' rent is paid back to the tenant by way of compensation, and in the case where a tenant has had occupancy for five years or more, one year's notice will need to be provided to the tenant.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill under debate provides for the deletion of a second six-month grace period for a landlord to evict.  Under current law, a tenant with six months' occupancy is classed as having a Part 4 tenancy and is considered to have a four-year lease backdated to the date the tenancy commenced.  Under current law, landlords can evict in the first six months and again in the six months immediately after the expiry of the four year lease.  What the Bill under debate proposes represents an improvement but still falls short of providing proper security for tenants.  This is because under the Bill a landlord cannot evict if the proper notice is provided in the run-up to the expiry of the four-year lease.  The anti-eviction Bill we intend to move in the House next week will provide a tenant with Part 4 leasing rights after not six months but two months, and will make the Part 4 leasing rights indefinite.  In other words, it will end the right of the landlord to evict in the run-up to the expiry of the four years.<\/p>  <p>  We hear a lot in debates on housing, and in the debate on the Bill, that attention needs to be paid to the question of supply.  We agree with this, but not in the way in which the issue is posed from the Government benches.  In one year 90,000 houses could be built, as they were in 2006, and it would not necessarily reduce rents.  The assumption it would is based on crude neoclassical economics where an abstract law of supply and demand is crudely applied to housing as if it always applied in all circumstances.  In fact, the only thing that will reduce rent is a supply of affordable housing and not just supply of any old housing, because what the market will supply if it is left to its own devices is unaffordable overpriced housing and rent.  This is what happened with the supply during the housing bubble and what will happen again if the Government repeats history by endlessly bleating the mantra of supply as the solution to all housing problems.  Relying on the invisible hand of the market to solve the rental crisis will not work because the invisible hand does not exist.  What is needed is a massive new supply of affordable and social housing, and the State taking responsibility for building social housing on a very significant scale would be necessary to tackle the rental crisis.<\/p><p>There are many problematic aspects to the Bill and I have outlined some of them.  I am sure there will be many, many amendments on Committee Stage.  Although there are some positive aspects to the Bill they are mainly quite cosmetic and do not deal with the real issues.  If our and other progressive amendments are not accepted on Committee Stage we will seriously consider voting against the Bill on the grounds that it does not get to grips with the housing crisis.  We will see what happens when the amendments are put.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700059#HHH00200","speaker":"1281","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481144700,"counter":532,"content":"<p>I find it ironic that the Minister tells us this Bill is an essential ingredient in the plan to tackle the worst housing crisis in the history of the State.  The Minister claims the Bill will address the key problems which have caused the housing crisis.  What are those key issues and what are the solutions?  The Government states that if this Bill goes through it will fast-track planning processes so that developers will not suffer delays.  It will streamline the role of local authorities and elected councillors so that developers do not suffer undue delays in planning.  It will extend the length of planning permission given to developers and fast-track and streamline environmental impact statements.  It will empower the Minister to take up to &euro;420 million from the local government fund.  It will place a slight delay on vulture funds or landlords evicting 20 tenants at a time, or ten, depending on what the Minister finally decides, and we are told that the great gain for those of us in the private rental sector is that the landlord will no longer be able to evict for the first six months or any subsequent Part 4 of the tenancy, but can still evict every four years for a multitude of reasons.<\/p><p>So this is the solution to the housing crisis but the problem is that none of us believes that these things are the cause of the housing crisis.  We do not have 140,000 families in housing need because developers face delays in planning permission.  Does anyone seriously expect us to believe that, or that 6,000 people are homeless because of the need for environmental impact assessments?  We do not have record evictions and repossessions, rent rises and the threat of further evictions because locally elected councillors have a say in the planning process.  We have a crisis in the housing market because we have a market in housing.  As in every market the priority is profit for developers, builders, estate agents, bankers, financial companies, corporate landlords, REITs, vulture funds and equity funds and we have a crisis because of the refusal of this and other Governments to build publicly funded and local authority housing on a need basis.  We have a crisis because of the refusal of this and other Governments to countenance the idea of controlling rents and strengthening the rights of tenants, rights which go right back to the Land League two centuries ago.  We will not solve this crisis and will, in fact, continue our reliance on the market, with blind faith in the same market that got us here.  All the other reasons given by the Minister for the housing crisis are nonsense; it is our reliance on a housing market that has got us to where we are and we will not confront the vested interests of those who are making a fortune out of that market.<\/p><p>I like the writer Naomi Klein very much.  She is a Canadian journalist who has written some very insightful things about economy, climate and crises in the world.  One of the things she famously said, in <i>The Shock Doctrine<\/i>, is that every elite in the world knows how to use a crisis.  As the saying goes, &quot;one should never waste a good crisis&quot;.  Even when the crisis is engineered or caused by the policies of the elite within the market system, the elite still knows how to use that crisis.  By God, the elite in this country and the Government are using the housing crisis to force through a serious wish list for developers and corporate landlords.  There are tax breaks, tax-free incentives for landlords, tax breaks for vulture funds and cheap funds for developers.  There has been a cut in the standards for apartments for developers and we are fast-tracking development and handing over public lands to developers for nothing.  We have cut the numbers of social housing that must be provided in private developments, right down to 10%.  We will go to heaven and back to ensure that developers and landlords achieve the level of profits they need in order to get them to build and rent.<\/p><p>Finally, as in every crisis we are not just presented with false solutions that go nowhere in trying to deal with the actual problem.  When we ask questions about the proposals we are shouted down and accused of standing in the way of the solutions.  Various Ministers and others have been scathing of anybody in any community who questions projects because of their concerns over the housing crisis.  If residents question the closure of a community hall or the bulldozing of a park they are accused of NIMBY syndrome by people whose own record of concern for the housing crisis is dubious and leaves a lot to be desired.  One cannot question the logic of modular or rapid housing or a development that might provide housing if it gets in the way of some other community facility.  The hypocrisy is sickening and the people in working-class communities who refuse the property rights of developers by trying to protect a facility in their area are lambasted for doing so.<\/p><p>The AAA-PBP wants massive investment in local authority-owned and built housing.  We want to see rent controls and an end to evictions at the behest of vulture funds and landlords and we want public lands in the hands of the public.  We want the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend, O'Devaney Gardens and the Oscar Traynor sites on the northside to be used to provide 100% public housing and that will not be done by this Bill, or by this Government.<\/p><p>It will be of no surprise to the Minister that we will table amendments.  We will point out that rent controls are viable, as they are in most civilised European cities and even in the United States of America.  We will state that we need to stop evictions and have to fund local authorities to build the good quality, high standard housing that is needed in each area for the elderly and for families.  These measures are possible but the political will is not there and this Bill will represent another failure to deal with the housing crisis created by a market in housing.  It will join the failed strategy of the previous Ministers, Deputy Alan Kelly and Alan Shatter, to speed up evictions, to put people in homeless situations and to provide profit through all sorts of tax mechanisms which enriched the very few who represent the housing market.

Whether he likes it or not, I understand the industry.  It annoys me that the people in this Government who make the decisions around the supply of housing do not seem to understand it.  They do not even seem prepared to talk to the people who do understand it.<\/p>  <p>  I want to give credit to a few people who have been putting some very sensible ideas into the public domain in recent times, namely, Mel Reynolds, an architect who runs a builders' blog, and Cian O'Callaghan, Linda Fox-Rogers, Enda Murphy and Gavin Daly from the University of Maynooth geography department.  Mel Reynolds did a graph for me, starting from 1975, showing the number of completions and the cost of housing which shows that, in actual fact, they go together.  The notion that if we increase supply the price will go down cannot be backed up by history because history says otherwise.<\/p><p>There is a reason for it.  There is a major barrier, in that it is not profitable to build housing for people on low and moderate incomes.  It becomes profitable only if they are allowed to borrow huge sums of money or if the Government helps in some way.<br\/><br\/>At one time, the Government helped out in housing by investing in the social housing stock and supplying social housing.  Sadly, for too long the Government has given up that tack and gone a different way.  Now, we incentivise developers to build.  This year and last year, despite all the best evidence, we decided to reduce the size of units to make it more financially attractive for developers to build.  This year, we brought in a first-time buyer's grant, which was also designed to incentivise developers, given that it was going to drive up the unit price .  Then, the Government got the Central Bank to reduce the deposit required to qualify for a mortgage from 20% to 10% of the price.  This was also going to incentivise developers and drive up prices.  Now, we are going to reduce good planning outcomes in order to do the same.  You could not make it up.  It is nonsense.<br\/><br\/>Yesterday, I read a brilliant piece written by Daniel Bentley, editorial director of the London think tank Civitas.  It is about the housing market in England and it is identical to the problems we have here.  It looks at the history of how England has run into trouble in housing for the very same reasons we have run into problems here.  It is worth putting on the record:<\/p><blockquote>There is a paradox in modern housing policy ... The aim of rolling back the state from housebuilding has turned its role from one of subsidising supply into that of facilitating ever greater amounts of spending power, making housing unaffordable for so many.<br \/><br \/>Margaret Thatcher recorded in her memoirs that, by the mid-1980s, &quot;everything in housing pointed to the need to roll back the existing activities of government&quot;.  She also felt that, in terms of building, owning, and managing housing stock, &quot;the state should be withdrawn from these areas just as far and as fast as possible&quot;.<br \/><br \/>In truth, the decline of council house building was already under way by the time Mrs Thatcher came to office.  But she accelerated a process which saw annual local authority output fall from 154,000 homes in 1967 to the low hundreds during the New Labour years.  The consequences of this have been far-reaching, and are at the core of today&rsquo;s housing crisis.<br \/><br \/>Not only did housing supply go into terminal decline, as is often noted, but the subsequent dependency on private sector housebuilders for new homes encouraged governments to permit &ndash; and increasingly to actively promote &ndash; the accumulation of purchasing power in the for-sale market.  This weakness among policymakers for stimulating effective demand has been disastrous for affordability, and is engendered by the simple fact that private-sector developers are only able to build as many homes as people are ready to buy.<br \/><br \/>This much is obvious and has always placed a natural limit on private-sector output, which is why for most of the 20th century it was topped up by publicly funded building.  It is a straightforward question of market absorption: more buyers means more new homes, fewer buyers means fewer new homes, and in the absence of a major public housebuilding programme, the effects of the cycle are reflected in the ups and downs of total output.<br \/><br \/>In this context, the answer to an under-supply of new homes appears always to be to increase people's ability to purchase them.  But there is a further complication, which is that those new-build homes must also be purchased at or above current market prices.  This is a function of the residual land value model, in which the price a developer pays for a site is worked out from how much they think new homes can fetch on the open market (minus building costs and the developer's margin).  The result is that developers can never afford to sell their homes below current market prices.<br \/><br \/>This means that housing supply rarely places any downward pressure on prices, while builders are constantly yearning for more demand in order to keep output going.  Governments, desperate to increase supply without funding it directly, have usually been happy to oblige &ndash; even as prices have raced away from earnings.  The housing market has thus become subject to an enormous increase in effective demand over the past half a century, with little if any effort ever made to contain it.<br \/><br \/>The process began with the liberalisation of credit, which started in the early 1970s but really took off in the 1990s with the relaxation of loan-to-value multiples and the introduction of buy-to-let mortgages.  This last point played a central role in the expansion of the private rented sector as landlords bought three million homes between 1990 and 2015, an entirely new source of demand in a for-sale housing market which was until the late 1980s the preserve almost entirely of owner-occupiers [or social housing].<\/blockquote><p>Developers do not want to build, given that there are better things to do with their money.  Due to the margin they would like to have, there are better ways of making money.  Do you know who would like to build?  I am tired of saying it here.  People forever think the developer and the builder are the same person.  The builders would love to build.  However, the pillar banks are practically closed to builders.  The builders are not seeking to make astronomical money turning over a profit on one unit.  A builder would be happy to make &euro;5,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;8,000 clear profit per unit.  The developer is a different animal.  The developer is an investor.  Developers are investing in commercial property in this town, given that it is lucrative to do so at the moment.<br\/><br\/>We have an amazing city for rental in the commercial and housing markets.  In fact, it is out of control.  Only three cities in Europe are deemed less attractive for investment in property.  That is an amazing fact.  What are we doing about the fact that the developer still does not have a huge appetite to build all the houses we want?  We are just throwing carrots at the developers.  We are reducing regulation, introducing financial measures to drive up prices and encouraging young people to buy.  Allowing a young couple to get a mortgage with a deposit of just 10% rather than 20% of the price is almost like a trap into debt for the best part of their lives.<br\/><br\/>The Government has a few options.  It can encourage builders into the game by organising finance for them.  Where will the money come from?  Over and over we are told that the State cannot borrow all this money on the books at less than 1%, given that to do so would break EU rules.  I recently read a report by Mr. Seamus Coffey of the Fiscal Advisory Council.  He said the ongoing debate around capital for housing had featured regular reference to the idea that our fiscal rules in some way prohibit additional capital spending.  He said it was not true.  He said &euro;2 billion of additional spending had been announced in the past nine months and said, if we so wished, it could have gone to housing.  He said we could have increased overall spending by even more if we had raised sustainable tax revenues to fund it.  He said we chose to use neither of these for additional funding for housing, although it was possible within the rules.<br\/><br\/>I saw answers from the Minister last week in which he admitted that a three-bedroom house in the Dublin area could be supplied by a local authority for less than &euro;210,000, with all services included, ready to go, from start to finish.<\/p><p>In the countryside, that figure is below the &euro;160,000 mark, which is a fact.  I have seen the figures lately for Wexford in respect of a few projects that are coming on stream.  The average price of supplying a house through the local authority in Wexford is going to be under &euro;160,000, including services.  When I hear the Government tell us about the wonderful idea of NAMA supplying 20,000 units which will sell for approximately &euro;330,000 each, I do not know what planet it is living on.  Why would the Government allow NAMA to supply 20,000 houses at &euro;330,000 each when even the local authorities in Dublin can supply a house for &euro;210,000?  I do not know the answer to that or understand the Government's thinking.  Is there a rationale behind it?  We will not even go into how NAMA will do it, the deals that will be done behind the scenes, how questionable that whole organisation is at this stage and what builders will be working for it.  Will it be the same fellows it looked after through the NAMA process?  It will hardly be the fellows that it shafted.<\/p> <p> This is nonsense.  Why will the Government not make the local authorities fit for purpose to deliver the housing?  If they are not fit for purpose at the moment, why do we not make them fit for purpose?  If they do not have the personnel to make it happen, address it.  No one has asked them to build the units.  That was never going to happen.  For a long time now, they have employed builders.  If they come up with a project to build ten or 20 houses, they ask X number of builders to price it and usually give it to the lowest tender.  It will be keenly done.  They probably need extra architects, engineers and surveyors within their own ranks but even if they cannot get them, people could be employed to do that work.  I do not see why the local authorities would not be able to recruit their own staff, however.  After that, the State should borrow this money at less than 1% and invest in infrastructure.  The notion that one should invest in crucial infrastructure is hardly rocket science.  Of course, it makes sense.  We are not even close to investing at the average European rate in terms of crucial infrastructure.  We are way behind.  In fact, the experts would say we were running to stand still because we are looking at an investment per annum in infrastructure which, to the best of my knowledge, is around the &euro;4 billion mark.  The fall off is actually around the same in terms of depletion.  In fact, we are running into trouble.  The State must take a different approach to investment in infrastructure.  There are huge problems around the construction industry and the way we supply housing, but we are not addressing them.  It is as if we do not want to know how it should be done.  If the Government relies on the private sector and developers to solve the housing crisis, it will be waiting for a long time.<\/p> <p> The Bill looks at problems around planning.  Planning is not the problem.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la issued a report in the summer which stated that the number of appeals for housing developments received over the past two years had remained low with 35 cases of the 30-plus units in 2014 versus the peak of 568 in 2007.  This is not the big problem.  Planning is not the problem.  Why would it be?  There are permissions to beat the band already given in Dublin.  There was nothing to prevent building except for a lack of interest.  They are controlled by developers who have better things to do with their money at the moment and while they are waiting, the value of the land and permissions on which they are sitting is growing by the day.  They would have to be off their heads to start building.  It makes sense to them to wait.  The Government is giving them an incentive to do so.  It has never dealt with the elephant in the room which is the taxation of landbanking.  When the crisis came in 2007 and 2008, anyone involved in the building game could have told one that the biggest problem of all was landbanking and the manner in which the whole industry got out of control because of the price of land.  One had a small number of people in control of a huge amount of potential development land and they sat on it for as long as they liked.  They were able to demand what they liked for it when it suited them.<\/p> <p> We are not in a very different place today.  They are again sitting on land.  As the Government brings in more of these measures, little bits of it will trickle out.  They will probably sell the land here and there rather than develop it themselves because that will be more attractive.  I reckon it is currently more attractive to developers to sell land now that these nice incentives have been brought in for them.  These incentives are for the developer and nobody should be fooled into thinking that they are for the people of Ireland who are in need of houses.  No one should be fooled into thinking that the people who are crying out for houses will be able to buy one of the Government's NAMA houses.  They will be too expensive.  The only explanation I can find for the approach the Government is taking is that it has sold its soul to neo-liberalism and does not want to move away from it.  Its approach is 100% neo-liberal.  People with experience on the ground and academics who have done the research are saying we must do things differently.  The private sector will not supply the Government with houses when and at the price it wants.  The State must start to build its own houses on its own land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700060#JJJ00500","speaker":"1355","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481145900,"counter":538,"content":"<p>This is the first major Bill to give effect to the D&aacute;il's response to the housing crisis.  As such, it must be welcomed even though its provisions will have to be monitored closely as to its overall purpose, which is to reduce radically the timescales involved in the planning of housing developments.  The ultimate solution to the housing crisis is obvious but difficult to achieve; a significant increase in the supply of housing units.  A significant barrier to rolling out the massive increase in builds is the unnecessary and bureaucratic delay caused by the current planning framework.  A national emergency like the housing crisis demands that we remove the barriers that delay the construction of housing units.<\/p>  <p>  These are emergency measures and I welcome that this is reflected in the time-limited structure of many of the provisions, with 2019 being the current expiration date.  This sunset clause is subject to extension by the Minister and Government of the day until 2021 should the need arise.  However, any such extension must be based on hard evidence.  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment enshrines that the extension of emergency measures will be contingent on a comprehensive review of the policy and the involvement of Parliament in its scrutiny.<\/p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendments on residential tenancies contain a constructive yet impactful suite of measures designed to give greater certainty and protection to tenants, while recognising that more than 90% of Irish landlords own three properties or fewer and are, in many cases, involuntary landlords.  They are not professional landlords and are, in many cases, under massive pressure themselves.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The most effective system of tenancies worldwide is one that involves larger and more institutional investments in the rental sector.  We need to transition to that model in a controlled way to protect tenants and the vast majority of landlords, who are also fellow citizens and who never intended to be in this position.<\/p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il will not demonise any sector or pitch one vulnerable group against another.  In that context, the reduction of the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment from 20 units to five will offer secure occupancy for more tenants, and this is only right.<\/p> <p> We have to remember that for the tenant, the property in question is his or her home for which he or she is paying.  The retention of a tenant's deposit where landlords are in receivership is also addressed by our amendment.  Further amendments will be introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il which will further enable tenants to remain in their homes with confidence about their future development.  The core of our amendments and support for the Bill lie in learning from the lessons of the past, and we will provide practical and measurable yet impactful policies to aid the Government in tackling the housing crisis.<\/p> <p> As a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, I know we will deal with the Bill and amendments next week, but I would like to take this opportunity, if the Minister of State will allow me, to be somewhat technical about a number of items I would like to bring to his attention in advance.  I wish to assure that this is done with a view to helping him and his Department to provide answers and allow the Bill to pass all Stages next week, if possible.<\/p> <p> I note a preplanning stage with the board includes the local authority and is a nine-week process.  Section 5 seems to suggest that a separate preplanning process has to take place with a local authority before the next step.  I am not 100% sure about this section, but that is how I have read it.  If that is the case, even though it is clearly stated in the Bill that there must be a meeting within four weeks, the outcome will not be time bound and there is no end date to the process, if I am reading the section correctly.<\/p> <p> Section 6(5) refers to a four week process.  I may be conflicted about the meaning, but I do not think I am.  If that is the case, there is a problem because the first date of public consultation with a local authority involves what I understand to be the board and the local authority planning process, but section 5(4) refers to the details of the preplanning process with the local authority.  I am not sure what the process will be.  I have been told it is a nine-week process, but my reading of the Bill seems to suggest that there will be two preplanning processes, one with a local authority and a second with the board and local authority, prior to the submission of an application to the board.<\/p> <p> I refer to material contravention and the strategic housing development in regard to material contravention.  I have reservations about this, as do most people.  We all know material contravention contravenes a local area plan or a county development plan which has gone through a statutory process and statutory public consultation process.  Does the amendment clearly state that a development of 100 houses or more that materially contravenes a plan can get planning permission?  That is what I understand, from my reading of the Bill.  I have some reservations and concerns about that.<\/p> <p> I refer to the environmental impact statement or the appropriate assessment for a European site.  Having gone through a nine-week process, additional information will then be requested in terms of whether reports or impact statements need to be carried out.  Each county development plan has done some appropriate assessment on the environmental and Natura sites within the document.  It should have been clear from the start whether this is required.  We should not have to wait until this section to find out whether it is needed.  Another 16 -week process has to be gone through to arrive at a solution.<\/p> <p> Having gone through a nine-week process, I am not sure whether there will be written confirmation that an application is suitable to be submitted to the board directly for planning permission.  There is a clause that states if the application is not up to standard, it will be back to square one.  I hope that someone will not have gone through a nine-week process only to be told that he or she will have to go back to the start again.<\/p> <p> As I said, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which met today.  If the debate is not finished today, I ask the Minister of State to give us an extra 24 hours to submit amendments, as was requested at the committee meeting.  I do not know whether the Minister of State will facilitate that request.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700062#LLL00200","speaker":"1357","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481146500,"counter":540,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I will discuss some of its provisions but also broader issues that will help in the delivery of jobs and rural development, which is a significant issue nationally and, more specifically, in the north west.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Focus Ireland on its campaign that involved 40,000 e-mails being sent to Members on behalf of the 20 families who become homeless every month and the 15,000 households who have buy-to-let landlords in arrears of more than  two years.  I have responded personally to each and every person who has contacted me from every corner of my constituency and advised them, as I do now, that Fianna F&aacute;il is tabling amendments to the Bill to enhance security of tenure and occupancy for tenants.  These amendments will remove the ability of receivers to evict existing tenants from rented properties that have been repossessed.  They also include a provision that where banks or vulture funds appoint receivers to rented properties, they should be required to take on all of the legal responsibilities of a landlord, including those relating to Part 4 tenancy obligations, maintaining the property and the obligation to return a tenant's deposit in full.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the new fast-track planning procedure, and any risks associated with it can be overcome if carefully managed.  The rationale for the new planning procedure comes from the fact that at the current time the vast majority of large housing applications are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Most often, the board upholds the local authority's decision.<\/p>  <p>  Under the new procedure, developers who want to build developments comprising more than 100 units will be required to engage in an extensive preplanning consultation process with local authorities for the first time.  This must be completed within a prescribed period of 16 weeks.  It is important to note that this process will not impact on the ability of third parties or local authorities to raise objections or make appeals.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the proposed changes do not have an impact on the democratic role of councillors in setting local area development plans and county development plans.  Any decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la adheres to the objectives and zonings set out in those plans.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities will continue to be the primary decision-makers for planning permissions for developments of fewer than 100 units.  Given the deficits in housing supply throughout the country and the persistence of historically low levels of construction activity, especially for multi-unit developments, we have to take any measures we can to help to get the market moving.<\/p>  <p>  While we support the amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, some amendments are required to enhance security for tenants in the private rental market.  The Bill does not deal with the serious issues raised by the Tyrrelstown case, in that receivers and lenders are not considered to be landlords under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  At the current time, lenders or receivers may seek to summarily evict a tenant without giving him or her notice as required under law.  Our amendment removes the ability of lenders or receivers to summarily evict a tenant.  It proposes on page 3, after line 27, to insert a new section to the effect that receivers appointed to mortgage properties and lenders who have initiated repossession proceedings are regarded the landlords in relation to existing tenancies and, where appointed, the receiver of the property shall be under the same tenancy obligations of landlords as specified in Part 2 of the Residential Tendencies Act 2004 and associated regulations.  This amendment ensures that where a bank or vulture fund appoints a receiver to a rented property, it should be required to take on all the responsibilities of a landlord.  Receivers would have the exact same obligations as landlords to existing tenants under Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act, such as provisions relating to the security of tenure, the maintenance and upkeep of the rented property and the obligation to return a tenant's deposit in full.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to a matter I raised in the House in October with regard to an objection to a planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la made by An Taisce, a body that has received &euro;6 million in State grants over the past five years.<\/p><p>Quite honestly, while it has a role to do what it does and to look after our national heritage, I do not think objecting to an application by an enterprise which currently employs 14 people and could employ a further ten is part of its function, particularly where the objection is on whether a road is suitable for extra traffic.  I am disappointed by the situation.  Nor am I saying anything here behind anyone's back.  I have made my views very much known to the relevant people.  I think it is disgraceful.  The Minister of State is from a rural area.  He knows what 14 jobs means to a rural area and he knows what 24 jobs could mean.  That is what we have lost.<br\/><br\/>I am sorry to say that the board has since refused permission for this business to expand.  In its decision notice it stated, &quot;It is considered that the development proposed to be retained would interfere with the character of the landscape, and would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard.&quot;  The decision notice further stated:<\/p><blockquote>Provision is also made for supporting rural communities through facilitating sustainable activities or uses in rural areas.  Section 4.1.4 of the development plan supports industry and enterprise locations in Sligo City and its satellite towns, as well as in key support towns and other settlements.  Policy provision is also made in Section 4.1.4 for development that needs to locate near a natural resource, as well as in Section 4.2 in relation to rural development and enterprise policies, including specific provision for rural resource-based enterprise.<\/blockquote><p>In my view, there is no more rural based an enterprise than a vegetable business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700063#MMM00200","speaker":"1344","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":542,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be straying beyond the terms of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":543,"content":"<p>An Bord Plean&aacute;la comes under the planning and development aspect of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00300","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":544,"content":"<p>That is true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":545,"content":"<p>This is where I am coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00500","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":546,"content":"<p>We will give the Deputy some latitude.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00600","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1481147100,"counter":547,"content":"<p>Given I have the time, as background, this application was made to Sligo County Council more than a year ago.

This principle or philosophy has not only utterly failed us by failing to provide homes - note I use the word homes - for our people but is the policy that caused the crisis in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  As I sit in the Chamber and listen, having listened on other days too, I note the narrative that is being shaped, but the narrative is not being shaped in my name.  The narrative is that local authorities, bad planners, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, objectors or An Taisce are the causes of our crisis, but the cause of our crisis is simply that we did not build enough houses.  The local authority was not provided with money so that there would be a balance in the market.  We need both the public and the private sector.  Rather than face reality, we construct a narrative to justify a Bill that is a developer's charter.  Even worse, this will intensify the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  More specifically, the national housing emergency - I call it that and I noted Deputy Seamus Healy called it that earlier on - has arisen for many reasons.  There has been the failure by successive Governments to provide funding to local authorities for what is now a period of almost ten years.  There has certainly been eight years of no money.  For example, the last time Galway City Council built a social house was in 2009.  I have repeatedly stated that in this Chamber.  The last time we built a house was in 2009.  We got quarterly reports on a regular basis.  The fault did not lie with the planners or the councillors.  We bought the land, zoned it and approved Part 8 schemes, but each time we sought funding it was not given.<\/p>  <p>  The quarterly report dated 10 October 2016 tells us that 4,720 households, somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 people, are on a waiting list in Galway city that goes back to 2003.  Interestingly, when a parliamentary question was tabled on the up-to-date figures, the reply contained figures for 2013.  The Minister of State might double check what is happening in terms of figures.  The report is dated 10 October and those figures are rising. <\/p>  <p>  The second reason for the crisis was the failure of third level institutions to plan proactively for and build student accommodation.  According to the Bills digest we received from the Oireachtas Library, the Higher Education Authority in 2015 estimated that there was an unmet demand for 25,000 bed spaces which was having an impact on the private rental sector.  That is my experience in Galway.  The authority stated that those shortages were most acute in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The National Economic and Social Council estimated that in 2015 there were 9,000 student households renting in the private sector.  The number will have gone up considerably since then, thereby adding to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  A third reason for the crisis is the systematic reduction of planning, engineering and housing staff at local authority level.<\/p>  <p>  The fourth reason, which I have mentioned already, was the utter reliance on the private market to provide homes, which it spectacularly failed to do, but which this legislation utterly fails to recognise and acknowledge and which will actually worsen the situation.<\/p>  <p>  A further reason for the crisis is Government policy.  A fundamental change was brought in by the last Government.  A person on a waiting list is no longer entitled to a social house.  This has been a fundamental change in policy that was brought in by the Labour Party and Fine Gael and one that is being continued by this Government.  A person no longer has a right to a house, regardless of how long he or she is on a list.<\/p><p>From 2003 onwards, in Galway city, people on the housing list have been entitled simply to social housing support.<br\/><br\/>What we now have is what is known as a housing assistance payment.  People who have been on the housing list in Galway city since 2003 received letters today informing them that they have no choice but to sign up to the housing assistance payment and come off the waiting list.  When I highlighted this issue in my previous life as a local councillor, I was informed by various party councillors that I was telling lies.  I will be the first to apologise if I am wrong but I am informed, as are the applicants who receive the letters, that there is no choice but to go on the housing assistance payment scheme and that those who do so must come off the housing waiting list.  The best that can be done for those in receipt of the payment is to be placed on a transfer list.  This means someone who has waited from 2003 until 2016 for a home must come off the waiting list.<br\/><br\/>A further reason for the crisis is that, with the housing assistance payment, more and more people are being forced into an unregulated private rental market without any security of tenure.  Into this frame came the National Asset Management Agency.  To take a local perspective, I have not seen a single social dividend from NAMA in Galway city.  On the contrary, the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel, which has a convention centre and many bedrooms, lies empty next door to the Galway Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, while the latter struggles to provide accommodation for its students and the housing crisis in the city continues.  It is a scandal that this hotel, which was owned by the State until 2007, remains empty.<br\/><br\/>The former Anglo Irish Bank building in Galway city also lies empty.  Commercial accommodation located beside the private bus station remained empty for a long time, although it and the Corrib Great Southern Hotel were sold to developers in recent years.  Mystery surrounds the building that once housed Anglo Irish Bank.  One must ask how we can have so many empty commercial buildings and hotels when people are sleeping on the streets of Galway and elsewhere.  There is no escaping the answer to that question.  It is, as Deputy Wallace stated, because Government Deputies have sold their souls to neo-liberalism.  That is, without doubt, what has happened.<br\/><br\/>I believe it was a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government which introduced the land aggregation scheme that was subsequently pushed by the previous Government.  The scheme has become a complete mystery, with no reference to where the land held under it is or to where it has moved.  Obviously, the land in question remains physically in the various counties but legal ownership has been transferred to a body in Dublin.  This was not mentioned.  How many acres of residential zoned land are held by this body somewhere in Dublin?<br\/><br\/>Significantly, the Government, in the text of the Bill, refers to providing housing units, rather than the provision of homes and communities.  The Bill fails to integrate its proposals in any meaningful way with existing policies, for example, integrated public transport policies or smart travel.  The Government has failed to provide the House with an analysis of what is owned by the city councils and local authorities, including Galway City Council, and how much land is held under the mysterious land aggregation scheme. <br\/><br\/>The powers of local authorities have been significantly reduced, leaving them with only a consultative role.  The value of the public consultation process in respect of city and county development plans has been undermined.  Most significantly, the role of members of the public in the planning process has been reduced.  This is notwithstanding the fact that judges have repeatedly pointed out that the public's role in the planning process is crucial and that members of the public are the eyes and ears of the local authorities in respect of planning transgressions.  Judges have gone so far as to refer to members of the public as part of the planning trinity, consisting of the developer-applicant, local authority and members of the public.  What the Government is doing in this Bill is further excluding the public from the planning process.  While I welcome the decision not to increase the &euro;20 fee for submissions on planning applications, I deplore the Government's failure to take this opportunity to abolish the fee and actively encourage citizens to take part in the planning process.<br\/><br\/>I note the concerns expressed by the Irish Planning Institute in its letter to the Minister.  I fully share these concerns which I propose to briefly outline.  The institute states that with regard to the pre-application discussion at local level, it is unclear how the discussion and decision making at board level will operate in practice.  It points out that the proposal further removes communities from their respective local authority and development plan.  This, combined with the stated aim of reducing the use of oral hearings, is also of concern to the Irish Planning Institute, particularly in light of Ireland's obligation under the United Nations Convention on Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, known as the Aarhus Convention.  Having refused to sign the convention for a long time, the Government is now completely ignoring it.  The Aarhus Convention clearly states it is vital to encourage rather than reduce public engagement and community involvement at all stages of the planning process. <br\/><br\/>The Irish Planning Institute also refers to the danger of overemphasising the provision of numbers of housing units and repeating mistakes of the past.  It points out that this is not a numbers game and we should be discussing the creation of homes and communities.  As I indicated, the institute refers to the failure to integrate with existing transport policies.  It points out that the planning system cannot and should not be made the scapegoat for failures in the housing market.  It also notes the lack of evidence used in making the decision to remove planning applications for projects involving more than 100 housing units.  There is no evidence that moving decisions in such cases to An Bord Plean&aacute;la will speed up the process.  In desperation, the Irish Planning Institute emphasises the need to ensure that planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la are adequately staffed.  I note that a survey carried out by the institute indicated that the number of planners in planning authorities decreased by one third between 2006 and 2015.<br\/><br\/>The Bill proposes to make cheaper finance available from the Housing Finance Agency to third level institutions.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify whether this refers solely to universities or is the institutes of technology sector included.  This step has been taken to address the unmet demand of 25,000 bed spaces to which I referred.  My concern is that while it is a good idea to provide cheaper finance to build student accommodation, no conditions are imposed to ensure accommodation for students is provided at an affordable level.  It is amazing that cheaper finance can be provided to build student accommodation but that it can not be given not to ordinary citizens who want to build homes.<br\/><br\/>On the change to moving orders for possession in specific cases to the District Court, I note Threshold's concerns that this amendment will speed up the process of securing vacation of dwellings.  While this may be a welcome development in terms of efficiency and reducing costs, it will have the most unfortunate effect of leaving more people homeless.<br\/><br\/>While I welcome the limited steps taken to introduce security of tenure and the decision to reduce the threshold in respect of the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment from 20 units to five units, these changes do not go anywhere near providing security of tenure in a market where the policies pursued by successive Governments have forced an increasing number of people into the private rented sector.  The Bills Digest of November 2016 cites a <i>daft.ie<\/i>reference to the rate of rental inflation, at 11.7%, as being the highest ever recorded.  The figure has since increased.<\/p><p>The utter failure to analyse the reasons behind the housing crisis, and this Bill, will intensify the housing crisis.  The city and county development plans will be in danger and under threat.  The fast-tracking of applications is not based on evidence and, in my opinion, is unnecessary without evidence being put before us.  <\/p> <p> I recently received a letter from a man who, with his wife and two small children, has been renting for seven years and was recently furnished with a rent review which proposes an increase in their rent from &euro;1,100 per month to &euro;1,500 without any consultation.  This person is a professional and his wife is a trainee professional.  They were struggling to meet the original rent, child care costs, high taxes and travel costs and they are now living with fear and uncertainty as they cannot afford the proposed increase in rent.  Rents in Galway have rocketed and they cannot afford them and they fear they will be out on the streets.  This is having a huge affect on them mentally and physically.  It is not my way to refer to personal letters but it is important to do so at this point to try to personalise the many facts that I have outlined.  I am not sure if it is worth appealing to the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Government to pause and ask questions as to what actually caused the housing crisis.  The Government needs to stop scapegoating and repeating a narrative that suits its own purposes.  We are not here to be negative.  My aim is not to condemn the Government but to highlight issues, one of which is the housing crisis which I have seen worsen since I was first elected as a councillor in 1999, which is 17 years ago.  My first speech in 1999 was on the rising cost of housing, which cost has continued to rise unabated in the past 17 years, unfortunately.<\/p> <p> At the risk of boring the Minister of State I reiterate that the main reason for the rising cost of housing is the utter failure of the local authorities to build houses in Galway and throughout the country because of the utter failure of Governments to provide funding.  I do not accept the reason given that it was too expensive to build or that the Government did not have the money to do so because during all of that time it gave money under various schemes to private landlords, including the rent supplement scheme, which was supposed to be a temporary measure.  It has now become the housing assistance payment, which is permanent, with applicants in Galway city being told it is now the only game in town.  All of this time Governments had money but they chose to give that money to the private market.  <\/p> <p> I am not here to demonise landlords.  They have an important role to play in the provision of affordable housing and rented accommodation.  However, this must always be balanced with direct provision by Government through the local authorities.  Instead of bypassing the local authorities the Government should be resourcing them to build on the land they purchased at huge cost.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700064#NNN00800","speaker":"1316","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481148300,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I will try to respond to as many questions as possible.  I am conscious that Committee and Report Stages will be taken next week and we will have another opportunity then to address many of the issues raised.<\/p>  <p>  I thank Members for their contributions this evening and last week.  There was also a lengthy debate on Report Stage of this Bill in the Seanad, during which many of the concerns expressed here were dealt with and we also took on board some amendments.  We are not suggesting that this Bill is the full solution.  It is only part of the solution.  We are all agreed that the real solution is to increase the supply of housing and, in particular, to increase social housing provision.  Those who say that the solution is not to be found in increased supply are wrong.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Wallace and others say that increased supply will not solve the problem.  Six or seven years ago, from 2008 to 2014, rents across many towns were half the price they are now because there were many vacant properties and there was no shortage of accommodation.  In the areas surrounding Dublin, including Wicklow, Kildare and Meath, it was possible to rent a property for &euro;700.  The cost of renting in these areas now is &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month.  Supply is an issue and so increased supply will help to resolve the housing crisis.  What we need is a combination of social and private housing.  We accept that, and this strategy seeks to address both.  The changes proposed in this Bill will help increase supply of social and private housing.  As I said, we will have an opportunity to tease out these issues further on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  One of the reasons for the introduction of the fast-track planning provision, which is temporary, is to try to encourage those who own sites and land and are in a position to build houses to do so now when we need them rather than in seven or eight years time, although I accept it will be 2018 or 2019 before any houses will be ready.  We are seeking the reactivation of sites in the near future rather than in the long term.  Different approaches are being taken in this regard.  Many people referred to carrot, sticks and levies and so on.  A site levy will come into force in 2019.  Based on advice from the Attorney General, owing to the Constitution, it cannot come into effect until then.  We are required to give people due notice that they will be taxed for inactivity on sites.  We are prepared to take another look at that provision with a view to strengthening it, if necessary.  The matter is currently being examined by an urban renewal group, of which I am chairman.  My officials and I are prepared to look at the possibility of increasing the amounts in question.  Regardless of that, the site levy cannot come into effect until 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The aim is encourage construction through reduced planning timeframes and other incentives such as infrastructural funding in order to encourage activation on sites in the near future.  That is our sole aim in terms of the planning changes.  The aim is not to remove powers from local authorities.  Like Deputy Connolly, I was a councillor for many years.  I agree with the Deputy that there has been a housing crisis since 1999.  Councillors are involved throughout the planning process  and what is provided for in the Bill relates only to zoned land.  The issue of material contravention does not arise.  However, I will check that.  The land concerned must be zoned land before the process begins.  I will have that issue clarified for the Deputy.  If we need to tighten up the wording in that regard, we will do so.  This issue was discussed during debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  The process relates to zoned land only.  Material contravention is an issue for councillors.  As I said, this process relates to zoned land.  In my view, in terms of the planning timeframe, currently councillors do not have a direct role in relation to planning applications.  They can make representations and can raise issues with a planner officially or unofficially by way of telephone or at a meeting, but there is no formal setting within which they discuss large-scale planning applications, although I always believed they should be able to do so.  When I was a councillor, we asked that we be allowed to do that and we did it for a while but because most people did not put the time into it, the system did not work.  In terms of the process now being introduced, following nine weeks of consultation and during the four week period during which the manager must make a submission, there will be an opportunity for a formal council meeting to discuss an application.  I will have that clarified for Deputy Casey.  As I understand it, there will be a nine week consultation process following which the manager then has four weeks within which to make a submission on behalf of the local authority.  During that period, there is an opportunity for councillors to have a formal discussion and have their views recognised and put forward in the submission.  This opportunity is not available currently.  Councillors will have a greater say in planning of a large-scale nature in that they will be able to point to situations that need to be addressed.  This will strengthen the process.  The aim is not to take away local authority powers, rather it is to fast-track planning temporarily for a number of years.  <\/p>  <p>  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment calls for a review after three years.  We also discussed that issue in the Seanad.  We agree that there will be a need for a full review of this process before any decision could be made to extend it for a further two years.  If all goes well, there may not be any necessity to do that.  If it is beneficial and it is working and it needs to be continued we will consider extending it for a further two years.  I can assure Deputy McGuinness, who expressed concerned about this, that this process will not be permanent.  I do not propose to go over many of the issues already covered by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in relation to the Part 8 process.  In regard to the delivery of social housing, as things stand, there is no cap on the timing for a Part 8 process, be that in respect of housing or infrastructure such as a road or a bridge.  Part 8 could go on for years.  That is not satisfactory either.  We need the Part 8 process to work quicker, faster and in a more streamlined line to deliver social housing, which is the purpose for which it is generally used.<\/p><p>This Bill is capping that timeline, which is welcome.  It should strengthen the position of those who really want to deliver social housing.  I sometimes question people's commitment to social housing in some local authorities, but certainly not in Galway.  In some areas, the system has been abused and dragged out without end.  That is not good enough.  This House, in the budget just gone and in the commitment in Rebuilding Ireland, has committed &euro;5 billion in taxpayers' resources to deliver social housing and the infrastructure to make it happen, in addition to other housing.  We added 50% to the budget for housing a few months ago.  However, if we cannot fix the processes for delivering social housing, we cannot spend that money.  The objective is to sort out the process to get the money spent as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> In respect of the Tyrrelstown amendment, there is some protection for people in a development with five units, as it now stands.  The figure originally proposed was 20.<\/p> <p> There is a rental strategy to be published in the next week or two that will deal with all the issues on rental raised tonight.  I will not go back over them all.  We discussed them at length in the Seanad and I have no doubt but that we will be doing so on Committee and Report Stages.  The strategy will deal with many of the concerns people have over rent.  We are committed to this matter and we recognise that there has to be a proper rental strategy to give tenants greater security and service, make renting more of an option and increase investment in rental property.  Despite the best intentions expressed here and the view that the State should provide all social housing, we are not in a position to do that.  The strategy should see approximately 130,000 units being built over the next four or five years.  We call them units because all types of housing are included.  We do not have the money to build all the units and we should not do so.  Apart from not having the money, we do not have the necessary capacity in the system.  I have no doubt but that the combination of private and social housing, and various forms thereof, is the right way to address this.  If one decided tomorrow to proceed entirely using social housing, one would not achieve the objective.  The idea is that, over the timeline of the strategy, or over the next four or five years, we will build the capacity in local authorities to deliver social housing.  The commitment is to deliver 47,000 units over the next five years and to be in a position thereafter to deliver about 10,000 per year, which is the position we were in once and where we should be.  If people want to go further thereafter, that will be fine too.  However, it is not possible to switch it on overnight.<\/p> <p> The capacity of local authorities to deliver social housing has been eroded, and this was the case well before the construction crisis.  We have decided to rebuild capacity and put money behind this.  That is a joint decision of the Houses.  Some &euro;5.5 billion in taxpayers' money is a lot of money to drive a social housing agenda.  We have been very clear with all the local authorities that it is real and that all parties in the House have committed to this at a minimum.  Others want to do more and that is fair enough, but everyone is agreed on the minimum.  We have explained to local authorities that the money is available and that they should make their plans for social housing, make long-term plans and have a pipeline of projects for 2018, 2019 and 2020 to build on what is done in 2017.  In the past, the local authorities were told to do that but the money was pulled away.  That will not happen now because the House is in full agreement that we have to tackle this issue.  The strategy is an ambitious one to rebuild social housing capacity but it is appropriate and correct.  We can add to it down the line if necessary.  The strategy will certainly deal with the current crisis.<\/p> <p> Members referred to the social housing waiting list.  The updated figures are being compiled and they will be published in the next six or seven weeks, or even sooner if they are ready.  We have never hidden any figures here.  That is not what we are about.  We are about using the statistics and figures to address the problem.  The Department, Minister and I published the figures on the homeless, those in emergency accommodation and rough sleepers.  The figures are published every month and are not hidden away.  We are dealing with this and not trying to hide from it.  We will not hide.  The plan is a very open and transparent one that seeks to address the problems and create solutions.<\/p> <p> The HAP is a solution for many.  Some like that but not everybody on the social housing list, numbering 4,000, 3,000, or 2,000 in Galway, would take a social house tomorrow if they got one.  Quite a few are happy with HAP and some would prefer a social house.  The HAP might offer a solution for the next two or three years while we catch up with supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700066#PPP00200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1481148900,"counter":553,"content":"<p>They have no choice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016120700067#QQQ00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1481148900,"counter":554,"content":"<p>It is not a case of having no choice.

HAP has been designed to address this.  The recipients are not being put off a housing list.  They are still on a transfer list, which is the housing list.  People have come off HAP and have taken a social house.  They are quite entitled to do so if their number comes up and if they are next on the list.  That is a local administration issue.
