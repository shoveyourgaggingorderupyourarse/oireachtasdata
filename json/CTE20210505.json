I remind those present that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the Leinster House complex only.  As normal, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated on MS Teams.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a formal request to the Business Committee that pre-legislative scrutiny for the Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2021 be waived.  The Bill complies with the advice of the Attorney General and provides the necessary powers to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to continue to administer justice in accordance with the Constitution.  The need for the Bill arose following a recent Supreme Court judgment in the Zalewski case.  The request from the T&aacute;naiste to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee in order that it might give its opinion on the request.  A copy of the request has been sent to all members.  Following today's meeting, we are required to communicate our opinion to the Business Committee in order for it to decide on the application for a waiver.  I welcome Ms Tara Coogan and Ms &Aacute;ine Maher from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and thank them for the briefing they gave some members last week.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to persons in their evidence.  The evidence of a witness physically present or who gives evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or may charges against any person or entity by name or in a way in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such decision.  <\/p> <p>  The opening statement was circulated to members in order to allow them to commence their consideration of this matter.  I invite Ms Coogan to make some brief opening remarks on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I am appearing before the committee to discuss the Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2021.  As the Chairman noted, the urgency in respect of this Bill arises from a recent Supreme Court decision which , on the one hand, saved the WRC's adjudication service but, on the other, found certain provisions within the statutory framework giving the WRC its powers to be constitutionally repugnant.<\/p> <p>  In essence, what this Bill proposes to do is address those immediate matters identified by the Supreme Court.  Currently, all matters before the adjudication service in the WRC would be held entirely in private.  That has now been found by the courts to be inconsistent with what is known as administration of justice.  While the Supreme Court is not saying that everything and anything must be done in public, some consideration must be given to those matters and we will address that issue in this short Bill.  The second issue, which means that adjudication cannot continue and cannot be effectively concluded until this provision has been introduced in law, is  that the Supreme Court was very critical of the fact that there was no provision in the statutory framework for the adjudication service which provides for the administration of an oath or affirmation and an associated penalty for a person who may wilfully give false evidence or mislead an adjudication officer.<\/p> <p>  Those are the two matters that the Bill will immediately address.  Due to the nature of the WRC and the various items of legislation under which it is responsible for carrying out investigations, these amendments will also need to be carried to be carried to the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  My Department has been co-operating with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While these amendments relate to procedural matters within the WRC and, as such, do not really relate to the policies under these particular Acts, it has been proposed that these matters would be addressed in this very short Bill in an effective way so that we can get over the difficulty that means that adjudications cannot be concluded and address the immediate concerns the Supreme Court orders identified.  Unfortunately, those orders had immediate effect so we were not given any grace period by the Supreme Court.<\/p> <p>  There are other small procedural matters that we propose to amend.  They relate to the independence of Labour Court members.  While it has never really been an issue, industrial relations legislation is missing that express statement so we are proposing to carry those amendments as well.<\/p> <p>  This is an immediate and urgent measure that we are proposing to take so that we can continue to provide the service to the people of Ireland in the WRC.  However, it is clear that once we have overcome this obstacle, we will have to examine the lengthy judgments of the Supreme Court, consider policy matters in more detail and engage with the committee in the more normal legislative process.  I am here to take any questions members may have and appreciate the committee giving me this time.  I am here because this is genuinely an urgent matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coogan.

I thank both officials for the briefing they provided.  It was very useful.  I fully appreciate that this is an urgent situation.  I am very concerned, as I think we all are, by the idea that hearings cannot now proceed and that an awful lot of people have been left in limbo.  We teased out some of these concerns at our meeting but, for the purposes of the record, I have a concern about people who have commenced cases.  Many cases do not finish quickly.  In an ideal world, a person would get in and get out in one day.  As anyone who has been before the WRC, the Labour Court or other forums will know, however, one does not always get in and get out in one day.  Very often, a further hearing can be scheduled for a date a couple of months into the future.  For those cases that have been partially concluded, we are going to have to make special arrangements, although I do not know if that is possible or how it can be done.  Given the strength of the view expressed by the Supreme Court, it strikes me that they cannot be concluded under the same system.<\/p> <p>  When An Bord Altranais, as the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland was formerly known, changed over, there was a facility for people who started under the old system of fitness to practice hearings to retain that.  However, I do not think that is going to be the case in this instance and I welcome Ms Coogan's view on this.  In the event that it is not, consideration must be given to a person who started under one system believing it was going to be one way.  I refer specifically to the anonymity, which is very attractive for some workers and, perhaps, not for some employers.  We need to consider that and try to figure out how to treat a person who took a case and is halfway through it now.  We must also be cognisant of the need for private hearings.  There must be some involvement from the stakeholders as well.  It cannot simply be that an adjudication officer just decides because there will be instances where both parties may want the hearing held in private.  Perhaps that should be facilitated.  I fully respect what the Supreme Court said but my understanding - and I am open to correction on this - is that it found that hearings cannot always be in private and that there must be some sort of latitude.  I caution that some workers would be very hesitant about coming forward if they do not believe they can have some level of anonymity and that must be catered for just as it is for whistleblowers, where it is very important.<\/p> <p>  On the oath, it strikes me as a bit odd that we would have an oath in any event but I understand where it comes from and appreciate that it might be necessary.  However, an affirmation is much more preferable and inclusive.  It includes everybody, so I favour that.<\/p> <p>  I made this next point at our meeting but will make it again for the record.  Time is ticking and we appreciate that but I raise the provision of a fairly robust review clause, bearing in mind that we will do this quickly.  Of course, it must be done quickly and I appreciate that.  There are people waiting but we must recognise that when we act fast, we sometimes do not get everything right.  Since that might be the case, there should be a very robust provision for review that includes engagement with people who are using the system, not a desk-based review but something that actually talks to trade union officials, employer representatives and employment rights lawyers so we get the sense of whether it is working or not.  I am conscious of the requirement to act in haste.  In that context, we may repent at our leisure.  If, however, there is a review clause built in, we can then test the measures that have been introduced.  The purpose of this is obviously to ensure that the measures work for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#B00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.  We are not going to be making a blanket provision to have absolutely everything in public.  There will be a provision.  The way it is proposed to be drafted, the policy will be that it is for parties to raise the issue with an adjudication officer and the parties will be given an opportunity to state their cases.  This means that there will be a decision made on this particular issue.  Obviously, there will also be an issue in the context of the naming of decisions because there is a public website, which is very useful and which is a very good way for justice to be visible.  Again, that is another matter the adjudication officer will be given absolute discretion to enquire into but also decide on.  That is one of those situations where an adjudication officer could, in the interests of special circumstances and depending on the types of people making claims, whether individuals who do not have legal representation may not understand what is involved or the fact that there could be a minor at the heart of a particular complaint, especially on the equal status side, make a decision and offer reasons therefor.  Again, there would be an understanding why something was done in a specific way.  That kind of discretion will be built into the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I agree that when this settles down we will have a better understanding of what is involved.  At the moment, depending on which side of the House I am speaking to, we almost have Supreme Court procedures being introduced, on the one hand, and then others looking for something else.  The WRC is a very unique place.  It deals with very simple matters and very complex matters and what we are trying to do is find the right balance whereby we are ensuring the administration of justice, that fairness is at the heart of it, that it is transparent and of a standard but at the same time it does not become a ten-year process.<\/p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy mentioned was what will happen to hearings currently in train.  I suspect some that have been halfway heard and that, where there was an adjournment, may have to be started again.  This might have to be before a new adjudication officer, in certain circumstances.  This is due to the fact that there might have been evidence obtained or a situation that took place without the oath provision.  As a result, there will be some disruption.  There is no point in me telling the Deputy this is all hunky-dory.  There will be some challenges.  The people in the WRC are doing their utmost.  They are consulting, talking and engaging with and writing to parties in order to try find solutions.  What everybody is being offered is an opportunity to revert to mediation which is a quick and private process.  Unfortunately, some of these issues will arise in the next few weeks as matters proceed.  There are some cases which will be able to proceed and to be concluded but there is now this issue, which is a real risk issue.<\/p> <p>  On the review clause, I have spoken to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, OPC, about the inclusion of such a thing and welcome any other members' views on it.  I see no problem with something like that.  As a civil servant, I must carry out reviews.  Every 12 months there is a post-enactment review, which I carry out.  There is absolutely no harm in doing something like that so I will talk to the OPC about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coogan and Ms Maher for presenting.  Unfortunately, I missed the previous briefings so maybe I will go over ground that has already been covered.<\/p> <p>  I would first like clarification that there is no need for retroactive provision in respect of case that have already been determined, there is no way in which there is any frailty for those.  My second question relates to what the frailty was in respect of false evidence.  Was it purely the fact no oath was taken or does this raise the need for some penalty provision being available to the WRC where someone fails to answer honestly?  I thought penalties of that nature could not be imposed other than by a court.  As a result, I am wondering exactly what line has been drawn by the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>Ms Coogan indicated there may be other policy matters raised by the judgment which may have to come back to the committee.  Perhaps she will indicate what those might be.<\/p><p> I was involved when much of this reform went through.  We were trying to reform an extremely legalistic provision where the process was slow, there was duplication and people were bringing in armies of lawyers.  The process had become very legalistic.  It is encouraging that it has stood the test of a challenge, other than in respect of what seemed relatively minor areas of difficulty, notwithstanding the importance of correcting them.<\/p><p> I commend the WRC on the work it has been doing and those who helped to bring through the reforms.

Going forward, however, this will be an issue.  Thankfully, we do not have to revisit the thousands of decisions that have been made at the WRC in the past six years.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on penalties.  The Supreme Court obviously felt there was a need to have the oath.  It was not really the oath or the affirmation but, rather, the idea of having a potential penalty associated with wilfully giving false evidence.  This is about the \"liar, liar\" type of person, or somebody who is wilfully misleading or abusing the judicial process.  It is to ensure there is a type of penalty associated with that.  It was a kind of package deal.  Since the WRC is not a normal court, \"perjury\" is not the associated term.  We will be providing for an offence.  I will be honest with the committee in saying I cannot see this becoming a regular feature but if a person was blatantly and clearly misleading or maliciously giving false evidence, the matter would then be referred to the courts for normal prosecution.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the policy matters, some concerns were expressed about the independence, skills and qualifications of the persons who are carrying out the adjudication service.  While O'Donnell was categorically clear that there was no constitutional requirement for these persons to be fully legally qualified, there are a number of minority decisions that disagreed with that particular provision.  We would look at the recruitment, skills, training and development and making sure people have the relevant skills and necessary understanding.<\/p> <p>  Another issue, which I should have mentioned and which will be addressed immediately in this Bill, is the unique statement in section 40 of the Workplace Relations Act that the Minister may revoke a warrant of appointment.  That would never happen in practice but the reality is that these words were somewhat alarming to the Supreme Court.  We will now provide a clear process setting out what would happen if a Minister were to revoke or remove an adjudication officer from office.  There is now the issue of adjudication officers as administrators of justice and what this means in the context of the system.  These are the kinds of bigger questions we must tease out.<\/p> <p>  We will have to look at some of the issues that are in the minority decisions.  While they are not binding, they will certainly have a persuasive element.  I hope I have addressed everything for Deputy Bruton.

There is simply no way around that.  The Supreme Court has given us quite a bit of leeway on how to do this.  We can do it in a way that will be fair and will address any genuine and real concerns out there.  For example, on the idea that hearings would be in public, the reality is that hearings are currently held like this meeting.  A person could, in writing, ask the WRC to sit in on a hearing, albeit remotely.  Most people who ask to sit in on hearings of this nature are family members, and sometimes it will be a member of the media.  I do not believe this will become a place that is overrun by members of the public observing proceedings.  There is sometimes a benefit to hearings being held in public.<\/p> <p>  We are giving broad discretion to the adjudication officer, the fundamental decision maker and the person who is in control of the facts of a particular case, to address issues such as anonymity and privacy.  I want the committee to understand that the WRC has done Trojan work trying to catch up with Covid-related delays.  It has carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders and has done whatever it could to put in place a very effective remote hearing system.  When we had this decision, the WRC had just started scheduling very large numbers of cases and for once it did not have the constraints of room availability, etc.  As such, there are some benefits to this type of scenario.  Unfortunately, there will be disruptions but I am sure that once we get over the initial changes and the shock they will bring, as well as the unfortunate delays, the WRC will be in a position to resume hearings again.  As I said, there will be some cases in which, in the interests of justice, it will be necessary to start again.  I appreciate that will be very frustrating for parties.  I hope they will understand.

It was approved by a huge majority in the Parliament, with 660 votes in favour and just five against, as was the resolution that accompanied ratification, albeit by a slightly smaller majority.  It reflects the Parliament&rsquo;s desire to approach this new relationship in a positive and constructive manner.  It also demonstrates strong solidarity with Ireland.  We continue to enjoy the solidarity of our fellow member states, as well as in the ratification process.<\/p> <p>  It is worth recording that the ratification obviously took an awful lot longer in the European Parliament than it did in Westminster, where it was scrutinised in 24 hours before its ratification.  That is a positive thing and the European Parliament was correct to accept provisional applications from 1 January, and to allow the opinions of the European Parliament to be gathered and fed into the resolution we passed.  It is worth reminding members that Michel Barnier&rsquo;s address to the European Parliament last week noted that Brexit was, to some extent, a failure on the part of the EU.  As we approach the launch of the Conference on the Future of Europe next Sunday, it is reflecting on learning its lessons and helping to ensure we feed that into a renewal of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  The accompanying resolution sets out the Parliament&rsquo;s position on scrutinising the agreement into the future.  These matters are not fully settled yet and we can discuss those further.  The overriding message from the parliamentarians was that we want to open up a range of mechanisms and that we want to make them a conduit for implementation of anything that emerges as a difficulty in a pragmatic manner.  These mechanisms can also be used for non-compliance and avoid the necessity for infringement proceedings, which we saw in March.<\/p> <p>  I would like to focus on the Northern Ireland protocol in particular, which I am glad to say emerged as a key priority in the debate and in the resolution.  In my contribution to the debate last week - in which more than half of Irish MEPs contributed - I noted that a poll carried out in March in Northern Ireland recorded that just 5% of people polled in the North trusted the UK Government to safeguard their interests in the negotiations on the protocol.  As I mentioned, John Hume's great achievement in respect of the Northern Ireland issue was to internationalise the Northern Ireland dispute.  He not only brought in US involvement but also EU involvement.  We are at a critical juncture in the constitutional arrangements on the island of Ireland and in the UK, and in relations between the EU and UK.  It is critical that we maintain that EU interest in the future of Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I spent many months raising awareness of sensitivities in Northern Ireland in the European Parliament.  I am glad to say that the language adopted in the resolution states that the European Parliament wants to engage in \"ongoing and enhanced dialogue between political representatives and civil society, including with Northern Ireland representatives, on all aspects of the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland and the broader Northern Irish peace process\".  This is dedicated towards the idea of developing connective tissue between the European Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly, and between Belfast and Brussels.<\/p><p>It commits the EU in the future to playing this role in ensuring peace and stability in Northern Ireland.  The EU should clearly not make any concessions to those engaged in violence but the unrest has demonstrated that we must ensure the protocol works for all communities.  As I have said, one of the ways to do that is through those channels of continued and sustained dialogue between Belfast and Brussels.<\/p><p> I have held the strong view that a dedicated parliamentary structure is required for dialogue between Belfast and Brussels in order to facilitate the kind of open and constructive debate that needs to happen.  This would help dispel criticism that decisions are being imposed on Northern Ireland by Brussels.  As members are aware, the Northern Ireland Assembly will vote on the protocol in December 2024.  That seems an awfully long time away now but it is important that we strategise in anticipation of said vote.  Much will be determined by the Northern Ireland Assembly elections of May 2022, but we must develop strategies to that end.<\/p><p> I have spoken for five minutes so I will not continue to refer to the paper I submitted to the committee yesterday.  I encourage members to look at the balance of it and I hope I can come to the other matters in the question-and-answer session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":31,"content":"<p>The sound is coming and going.

It is great to see him, albeit virtually.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on some matters, the most important of which is his final point.  The Chairman alluded to it, namely, the suggested parliamentary structure between Belfast and Brussels, which would be really progressive and important.  I would appreciate it if Mr. Andrews could, for the sake of the meeting and the public record, take a moment to elaborate on the idea.  A number of people in Northern Ireland have also raised the prospect of observer status for Northern Irish representatives and it something we have seen before in the case of accession states, for example, Croatia, before they join the EU.  They did not have voting rights but they were able to participate and shadow the work, particularly in the European Parliament, as well as the European Committee of the Regions on a local authority level.  What are the thoughts of Mr. Andrews on that?<\/p> <p>  I have two specific questions on the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA.  I raised the first with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, last week.  In an address to the European Parliament, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke about enforcement capabilities and the fact that the European Union will have teeth in order to ensure this agreement is followed.  What sort of role will the European Parliament play in this?  Crucially, what is the role of member state parliaments and governments when it comes to enforcement?  The enforcement of the withdrawal agreement has led to a number of legal challenges from the European Commission against the British Government over the implementation of the protocol and various unilateral mechanisms so I am interested in how that will fall in with the TCA.<\/p> <p>  The second point concerns improvement.  We are all quite aware that while we are glad there is a TCA and it was not a no-deal position, it is relatively thin and the agreement certainly pales in comparison with what we had when the UK was part of the European Union.  On the basis of a small margin in a referendum result, the British Government has pursued a very hard Brexit, which is disappointing.  What is the scope to build on this agreement and perhaps get greater co-operation?  I am specifically thinking of areas such as veterinary matters or sanitary and phytosanitary concerns.  This might take pressure off the protocol in one way while ensuring the EU and the UK can remain very close partners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#B00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>If we keep the engagement brisk, members will get a chance to contribute again as there is no shortage of time today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#B00400","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The committee might hear me better without my headset.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>It seems a little better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#B00600","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Richmond for his question.  There are three options for what I might term connective tissue between Brussels and Belfast.  We could have a Northern Ireland delegation of the European Parliament.  This is something I have in mind to do and it is something that could be done without requiring any permission from governments.  Currently, there is a joint consultative working group under the withdrawal agreement comprising expertise from civil servants.  There is, however, no representation of civil society, academia, experts in human rights or parliamentarians.  It is a good mechanism but it meets once a month and cannot make any binding decisions.  It must feed into the joint committee.  There is a real need for a parliamentary option.<\/p> <p>  The primary way to deal with this would be to carve from the parliamentary partnership assembly a subcommittee dealing specifically with Northern Ireland.  There would be Members of the European Parliament and MPs from the UK, with the potential to have MLAs involved.  Failing that, there could be a Northern Ireland delegation from the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  I have raised with the President of the European Parliament that there should be a Northern Ireland Assembly office located within the European Parliament building because of the special status of Northern Ireland.  We must really remind ourselves all the time that Northern Ireland is in a totally unique position because it is in the Single Market for goods and it will be affected by EU laws that we make in the European Parliament and in the Council.  We are guardians of the Good Friday Agreement into the future so it is really critical we establish some better connections with the Northern Ireland Assembly and leave the door open.<\/p> <p>  On the question of enforcement capabilities in the context of the agreement, the role of the European Parliament is evolving.  In the resolution we set out our ambitions for how we will be involved.  Normally, with trade agreements, the European Parliament is entitled under treaties merely to be informed of what is happening.  We have sought from the European Commission an inter-institutional agreement, which gives stronger powers to the European Parliament.  The European Commission has indicated it will involve the European Parliament in the bigger questions, such as the power that the Commission has to end the TCA with 12 months' notice or to amend it.  Any of those steps would include the European Parliament.  The process is really evolving and the European Parliament is trying to decide exactly where its supervisory position will be.  Will it be within trade and foreign affairs committees or will the UK co-ordination group continue?  All that remains to be seen.<\/p> <p>  On the question of member state parliaments, much can be done.  Within the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement we must really put new energy into that.  I am particularly concerned with North-South and east-west co-operation.  That is strands two and three.  I am surprised the scrutiny function of this committee has not changed post Brexit.  We relied, to a certain extent, on Whitehall to analyse some of the proposed regulations and directives coming from the European Union and we could do more to scrutinise future legislation, with a particular focus on how it might affect Northern Ireland.  Perhaps the scrutiny function could be reviewed.<\/p> <p>  It is probably worthwhile mapping the multiple reviews that are coming up under the TCA and the withdrawal agreement, whether they concern the grace periods we have heard so much about, the four-year review of the protocol or reviews of fisheries or the TCA.  All of these are pitfalls so it would be worth mapping when those reviews are due and what are the issues.  In developing its work programme, the committee to tailor it to some of the potential minefields that lie ahead.  The Deputy is absolutely right that this is a thin agreement.  It is supposed to be a foundational agreement with additions on security and defence, recognition of professional qualifications, data and financial equivalence.<\/p><p>All these things remain to be settled and all of them are minefields.  This committee will probably be well served by mapping all of that out and figuring out how to contribute in some way to safeguarding Ireland's interests, and, indeed, Northern Ireland's interests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#B00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Andrews for his presentation and engagement.  I agree with him about the parliamentary structure.  That is an important matter.  He mentioned the legacy of John Hume in internationalising the Northern Ireland issue.  It would be a tribute to his legacy, as a former Member of the European Parliament, if the European Parliament could be proactive and recognise its role in the Good Friday Agreement.  I encourage Mr. Andrews to push that engagement with the Northern Ireland committee.<\/p> <p>  Beyond the Irish MEPs, what is the extent of the engagement within the Parliament around the trade and co-operation agreement?  I got the feeling that when Brexit happened, the Parliament had moved on.  Brexit had happened and it was left to the Irish MEPs, such as Mr. Andrews and Deputy Harkin when she was there, to fight the fight because Europe had taken the view that it had moved on.  Is it the same with the trade and co-operation agreement?  Are we the only country that is actively engaged in monitoring it, given the impact it will have?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Andrews spoke of the passing of the agreement representing a new phase.  The papers this morning are reporting on the situation in Jersey, where the French Government is threatening to cut the power to the island as a consequence of a dispute on fishing.  Our own fishing community here is alienated once again from this agreement because of the impact it is going to have on it.  Mr Andrews mentioned in his submission that there are 27 issues yet to be sorted out around the protocol.  At what stage are we going to move on to the constructive part of this new phase?  He also stated that progress on those the 27 issues is slow.  Is it slow at EU level or at UK level?  How can we inject urgency into that position?  Resolving those issues would allow us to build confidence in the protocol within the unionist community, to show that it actually works in the best interests of Northern Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  I will deviate slightly from the topic.  Mr. Andrews mentioned the Conference on the Future of Europe starting way back in November, which seems like a long time ago.  This was our priority at that time but events have overtaken us.  Given what Michel Barnier has said, how would this and the events of Brexit feed into the work of the Conference on the Future of Europe in a measurable way?  What can Mr. Andrews say about that conference, as something real as opposed to something that is happening within the EU bubble?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#C00200","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":39,"content":"<p>The Deputy's comments on John Hume are very well received.  In fact, the President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, quoted extensively from John Hume in her state of the Union address in September.  He continues to be a very influential person.  Billy Kelleher and I, on Mr. Kelleher's initiative, are seeking to name one of the buildings in the European Parliament after John Hume.  I am not sure how that is going but it is something we can continue to pursue.<\/p> <p>  As regards the non-Irish MEPs, they are very interested in all these issues because they have an impact but the further east and south one goes, the less interest there is.  It is not a first-tier issue any more; there is no doubt about that.  However, there are serious concerns around data adequacy and financial services among non-Irish MEPs.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Calleary referred to fisheries.  The French Government is very exercised about this and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, made the point to this committee last week that this was a suboptimal outcome for Irish fisheries.  That is accepted and hopefully the Brexit adjustment reserve can go some way to mitigating the damage that has been done to the Irish fishing fleet.  The protocol has dominated the relationship between the EU and the UK in the first few months.  There have been little skirmishes around recognition of the EU ambassador in London, for example, and obviously the Article 16 situation did not help things.  There are many more issues to be resolved now between the EU and the UK that go beyond the protocol.  We have mentioned that security and defence issues must be resolved.  The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, COP26, is coming up and the UK will look to the EU for solidarity around developing outcomes from COP26.  The same can be said of the G20.  The Johnson Government will look to move on beyond the protocol, which might explain the better atmosphere in the exchanges between David Frost and Maros &Scaron;efovi since their first informal meeting in April.  I mentioned 27 issues and that is just with the protocol.  There are many other issues regarding the trade and co-operation agreement that we are seeking to resolve.  The very specialised committees under the trade and co-operation agreement are open to all member states.  Ireland will attend all of those committees but lots of other member states will attend those specialised committees as well.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Conference on the Future of Europe, as Monsieur Barnier said, it has forced people to think about these things.  Whenever there is a crisis in Europe, it is an existential one.  Nobody ever has a conference on the future of Ireland.  The very idea that a state is somehow contingent on the way it manages to deal with crises as they come up is a slightly negative narrative.  We need to focus on outcomes and making sure we can create the circumstances for job creation, viability of businesses, prosperity and growth in our economies.  That is what citizens want.  They do not want to hear about inter-institutional agreements or the balance of power between the institutions.  None of that is of any concern to them.  It is going to be very hard to get traction on a public consultation on this.  There is a website where anybody can contribute their views on the future of Europe, there will be a launch next Sunday and the Irish Government will carry out public consultations.  However, in the Institute of International and European Affairs we did a public consultation on the future of Europe - I believe Senator Chambers and Deputy Richmond were involved - and it was difficult to get public engagement.  In the context of what is happening now and what people's real priorities are, it will be difficult to get engagement but that remains to be seen.  It will be based on the political will and effort put in by the member states.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, followed by Deputy Haughey.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#C00400","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I think Deputy Haughey is next.

Mr. Andrews' submission states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tNo less than 19 technical committees will oversee implementation of the [trade and co-operation agreement], under the auspices of the Joint Partnership Council.

It is at the parliamentary assembly level where MEPs will have a role to play.<\/p> <p>  The role of Northern Ireland citizens in the Conference on the Future of Europe will be at the consultation phase.  There will be a role for Irish parliamentarians from the Oireachtas in the Convention on the Future of Europe, which will meet three or four times.  Two of those meetings will be physical with the third one- and maybe a fourth - being virtual.  It is likely there will be four representatives from each member state parliament.  They will absorb what has been found based on the input from citizens across the European Union.  It will be the duty of whoever represents Ireland at this convention to make sure they know the concerns and anxieties of Northern Ireland citizens.  We can pretty much anticipate some of those things.  Nevertheless, it will be down to those Oireachtas representatives at the convention to feed that information into the final outcomes of these processes.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Haughey referred to the strident tone of Ursula von der Leyen.  There is a major trust issue.  The UK Government has consistently demonstrated a lax attitude to rule setting, which goes back to the withdrawal agreement itself, when David Davis said it was not binding.  Grace periods were extended unilaterally to the internal market Bill in September 2020.  Even internally in the UK, there were issues with the prorogation of the UK Parliament, along with lax attitudes to standards, norms and rules that generated a serious amount of doubt as to whether the UK signed up to an agreement to which it will adhere.<\/p> <p>  The level playing field terms of the trade and co-operation agreement carry strong powers for the European Union to enforce those terms and, potentially, allow for the triggering of rebalancing measures, which means tariffs.  This would be negative for Ireland and has to be avoided at all costs.  That is why we need to put fresh energy into the political structures in order that we can depoliticise and dedramatise all of the potential conflicts and minefields ahead of us.<\/p> <p>  That is also why it would be useful for the committee to map out that timeline of what is coming down the line.  Take the grace periods, for example, one is concluding at the end of June regarding meat products under the withdrawal agreement.  Another one was unilaterally extended to the end of October with medicines at the end of December.  Each of them potentially could trigger political disputes that would imperil everything else in the agreement.  We have to be careful about all of this.  That explains, to a certain extent, the rather strident approach of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  She reflects pretty well the view in Europe of this UK Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I was going to ask what the view in the European Parliament on the British Government was.

They will not have any input or oversight, apart from what is in the joint consultative working group at this time and through the UK Government.  Polling shows Northern Ireland does not necessarily trust the UK Government to properly safeguard its interests.  That has brought the entire Northern Ireland people together on a political issue and unified them in a way almost unprecedented in Northern Ireland's political history.<\/p> <p>  As one of the academic papers pointed out, what is required is the earliest possible upstream visibility of proposed legislation coming from the European Union regulations and directives and how they might impact Northern Ireland.  The sooner we can establish that, the sooner we can then counteract the narrative that Northern Ireland is forgotten about and yet is impacted.  The sooner we can counteract the possibility of voices in the Northern Ireland Assembly claiming the first they heard of EU law was when it was being transposed into Northern Ireland law, the better.  It is critical that we strategise for the better involvement of Northern Ireland parliamentarians in the scrutiny of upstream legislation in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p>That is really critical.  It is not just me who is saying this.  I have had widespread support in the Renew Europe group from MEPs from Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Germany for establishing something of this nature.  It is a pretty open goal for us to able to achieve that.  Let us see how the parliamentary assembly gets up and running.  There is no significant interest or enthusiasm on the UK side in respect of the parliamentary partnership assembly.  It did the trade and co-operation agreement but the UK attitude seems to be that this institution will not automatically be set up and that it really depends on whether both sides are inclined to do this.  One thing this committee should watch carefully is to see whether that UK-EU parliamentary assembly is established because it is the only political level at which the trade and co-operation agreement can be overseen in all of its implications.  It is our view as MEPs that the withdrawal agreement should also be overseen by the parliamentary assembly.  <\/p><p> Regarding the question about the digital green certificate, again, it was supported with a very large majority in the European Parliament last week.  What that did was give a negotiating mandate to the MEPs who will represent the European Parliament in discussions with the member states about how the regulation would look.  Those discussions between the European Parliament and member states started on Monday.  One of the things the European Parliament has called for, which I support, is for members states to not be in a position to impose quarantine measures on EU citizens travelling within the EU who are in possession of a digital green certificate demonstrating that they have been vaccinated, have recovered from Covid or have had a recent PCR test that was negative.  We want to get tourism and hospitality up and running and we want people to enjoy their free movement rights under the treaties.  There are also many cross-border workers.  It does not affect Ireland but on the Continent, cross-border workers being able to go back and forth without having to observe some of the public health restrictions is a significant issue.  <\/p><p> This has been widely accepted in the European Parliament.  There is enthusiasm for it.  There are some concerns about its interoperability with third countries, in particular the UK, but the UK is developing an app and it is its intention that it will be accepted in other countries.

The unilateral decision to extend grace periods triggered the infringement proceedings.  The UK has until 15 May to respond to that.  The next step would be a reasoned opinion and it could end up before the European Court of Justice.  However, there is a question as to whether the UK courts would enforce a ruling of the European Court of Justice under that mechanism so it is really untidy and it takes an awful long time to resolve those issues.  There are specific mechanisms for dispute resolution within the trade and co-operation agreement that can lead to enforcement measures, up to and including suspension of parts of the agreement, up to and including ending the agreement completely so we are never more than a year away from a no-deal outcome because one of the parties can end the agreement with 12 months' notice.  We want to avoid all of that and the very complicated institutional architecture that has been created in other trade and co-operation agreements is designed to avoid all of those potential pitfalls and outcomes.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Richmond mentioned at the beginning, this is a very thin agreement.  It is full of pitfalls from what has already been agreed.  A range of issues remain to be agreed.  My concern is that Northern Ireland could become collateral damage and that it could add to the uncertainty and instability in Northern Ireland.  This is one of the things we are watching very closely.  That was one of the main reasons that I was persuaded that ratification now was the right thing to do.  We were all anxious that we would not ratify until there was full compliance with the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the protocol but we were convinced that because of the dispute resolution mechanisms, which are far less unwieldy than what was on offer before that, it was worthwhile putting that in place.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>It does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#E00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":52,"content":"<p>It was interesting to hear Mr. Andrews say that MEPs across the board are still interested.  I thought that some of that interest might have diminished as other issues took hold.  Is there any sense of frustration and of wanting to move forward or because of the particular set of circumstances, does Mr. Andrews get a sense that they are willing to stay with it not just for now but for as long as it takes?<\/p> <p>  My second question refers to the proposals by Mr. Andrews about some kind of Northern Ireland delegation to the European Parliament.  Could he flesh this out to look at where this starts and finishes?  Who would set it up?  Who would take on responsibility?  Mr. Andrews mentioned civil society at Northern Ireland level as well as parliamentarians.  If we look at civil society, where does one start?  Who is involved?  How does that feed into the European Parliament itself?  Would it be through a special committee or some other mechanism?  What would its role be?  What would it do?  How much influence might it have?  Would it be consultation only or would it have specific influence?  It is an excellent idea.  It must be meaningful but at the same time, it must operate under the current legal basis.  Mr. Andrews mentioned observer status.  In respect of countries that were going to join, these were people who were elected as MEPs so there was a specific structure for that.  Any detail Mr. Andrews could give me on a proposal for a specific structure would be welcome.  <\/p> <p>  My third question relates to the conference on the future of Europe.  Having been in the European Parliament during the referendums on the Lisbon treaty, the Stability and Growth Pact etc., I agree with Mr. Andrews that people are not interested in the different competences and institutions.  Essentially, they want to see that Europe works.  Whether this is around a vaccination programme, investment post pandemic or a response to climate change, that is what most people want to see.  I agree that for Europe to work more efficiently, we probably do need treaty change but can we deliver it?  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#E00500","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":53,"content":"<p>Deputy Harkin knows the European Parliament better than I do.  I have only been here a year but I have been astonished by the level of knowledge.  If we look at what has happened since 2016 when the referendum happened, we can see the number of MEPs who came to visit Ireland, visited the Border and had an opportunity to engage.  It was an eye-opening experience for most of them.<\/p><p>They were surprised by the degree of division that remains in Northern Ireland.  There is an interest in it.  There is a strong sense of sympathy for the nationalist position among MEPs, apart from the Irish MEPs, in the context that the partition was a historical mistake.  Unionism probably has does not have as great a listening ear in Brussels as nationalism.  I see that as a problem because all communities in Northern Ireland must be listened to and their voices must be heard regarding the protocol.  There is a continuing interest in the issue but it is very much reduced.  We will not find it on the European Council agenda for a long time to come.  It is a tier-three issue at this stage compared to where it used to be.<\/p><p> To flesh out my thoughts on this, first, there will be a UK delegation, which is an official delegation of the European Parliament.  I am a member of the South African delegation and there is a US delegation.  That is an official delegation that will be set up.  I suggest we would have a carve-out of the parliamentary assembly specifically dedicated to Northern Ireland with representatives of the Northern Assembly and the European Parliament, but I am hastening very slowly on that because it would have a great number off pitfalls.  The questions Deputy Harkin posed are practical as to who is involved, the buy-in from all communities in Northern Ireland and what powers this might have.  Let us remind ourselves that the parliamentary assembly under the trade and co-operation agreement merely has the power as a forum to exchange views.  That might seem like a talking shop to most of us but one of the great deficits as a result of Brexit is the proximity between members of the Oireachtas and Westminster and of officials from Ireland and the UK.  I read recently that John Major remembered the peace process and much of the progress that was made under his tenure was created in the margins of the European Council between himself and Albert Reynolds prior to the Downing Street Declaration and in the run-up to the Good Friday Agreement, after which both of them had moved on but they both made a major contribution.  That is where this sits as a carve-out of the parliamentary assembly.  Alternatively, there is a possibility for somebody like me to simply set up a Northern Ireland group within the European Parliament.  That does not require approval from anybody.  It would be just an interest group which could develop over time.  However, I want to see what we get out of the parliamentary assembly and if that can be set up at all.  Those issues remain to be seen.<\/p><p> On the Conference on the Future of Europe, it is all about investment, climate action, recovery, vaccines and making sure the European Union works for citizens, but there is also another issue since the last time we probably reflected on it, which is the massive decline in democracy and pluralism across the globe.  The democracy index produced by Freedom House at the beginning of the year noted that less than 20% of the global population live in free countries and that democracy has been backsliding across the globe for 16 years consecutively.  The European Union is an island of pluralism, rule of law, democracy and internationalism.  There is a bit of restating some of those values that bind the European Union together.  There are problems within the European Union.  Let us be open and honest about that with respect to Poland, Hungary and the rule of law.  The Conference on the Future of Europe is an opportunity I hope will be taken to restate those values and to be definitive that these are values that are worth defending and restating.  It is not insignificant considering what is happening across the globe, particularly on internationalism, which is such a key interest for Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>We will move on to a second round of questions.

I am surprised there is not more debate within unionism on that, but there are voices within unionism that recognise, and this comes out in polling all the time, that the harder the Brexit, the greater the support for unification of the island of Ireland, with the corollary being that if Brexit works or if it is seen to work it may strengthen the Union.  I am somebody who supports the unification of the island of Ireland and I am surprised unionists are not strategising more about the practical implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement and all that goes with it.  If we can achieve some progress on the protocol, the grace periods and all the constitutional anxieties that arise in unionism regarding its status within the UK and deal with some of those issues, we can move on to having proper discussions about the practical implementation of all the consequences of the withdrawal agreement.  <\/p> <p>  I have spoken to many people in Northern Ireland.  This issue is not necessarily something one can talk about in public but I have had very constructive discussions with people in North from all communities.  Those discussions have informed the proposals we put before the European Parliament and they have been adopted in the resolution that accompanied ratification last week.  Hopefully, in due course when we get past these protocol issues and restore stability that might be possible.  In practical terms, while the Assembly elections in May next year do not permit a great degree of flexibility, it may be something that will take a little bit longer than originally anticipated but that does not mean it is any less relevant and 12 months is a very short period in Northern Ireland politics.  We will stand by and carry on having continual and structured dialogue with our colleagues north of the Border and hopefully it will be to the benefit of all communities in Northern Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Andrews for that reply.

That is where the pushback comes from and it is why the resolution does not use the exact wording I had proposed.  That is practical and there is enough in the wording to progress the proposal.<\/p> <p>  I have spoken to people about a referendum on Irish unity.  There is a position that if the outcome of any referendum on Irish unity moved towards a unification of Ireland, it would trigger Northern Ireland coming into the European Union.  The former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, achieved that in the European Council a few years back.  There is a great interest in the potential disintegration of the United Kingdom and what it might mean.  There is also a question of Scotland coming into the European Union, and this has implications for Spain and Catalonia, as the Deputy said.<\/p> <p>  I support the Taoiseach's shared island vision that this is not only about reunifying territory but primarily about unifying people.  We are a long way from a border poll and Irish unity.  One of the lessons of Brexit is that one does not hold a referendum when one does not know what the landing ground is.  We have not held enough conversations politically on this island about what that landing ground would be.  Sometimes the metaphor of an acquisition or a merger is used.  I do not believe it will be an acquisition where Northern Ireland simply disappears.  It will be more of a merger where two entities merge into a new one.  We must have that discussion.  We must have a landing ground that is clear to voters when they are voting, North and South, in a border poll.<\/p> <p>  We also must review the Good Friday Agreement.

The first, which is to some extent the elephant in the room, is the fact that the trade and co-operation agreement has no scope in the area of financial services.  There is much more discussion to be had in this area.  There is an acutely difficult path ahead for Ireland, especially for Dublin where Mr. Andrews and I are from, and the impact on the financial services industry here.  Our industry very much complements the City of London, as opposed to possible competition from other large European Union member states and cities.  Will Mr. Andrews give his view on what discussions need to happen, or are happening, and how they should go with regard to equivalence, clearing or any of those areas?<\/p> <p>  I was taken by a speech Mr. Andrews made in plenary session - I believe it was before Christmas - in which he referred to keeping an empty chair in the European Parliament and how the former MEP, Otto von Habsburg, had spoken about how this represented the central and eastern European countries that had been left behind.  We were all thrilled at the weekend to mark the anniversary of the accession of those states.  Mr. Andrews made that point in the context of the UK leaving the EU and possibly returning.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mr. Andrews, in their back and forth, referred to the possibility of Northern Ireland coming back into the EU as part of a united Ireland, as is allowed for under the European Council decision of 2016, and an independent Scotland returning to the EU.  The empty chair, for which Mr. Andrews made the case, is a salient and emotive image but it is also very true.  The return of the UK to the EU should be an aspiration.  Ireland has a duty within the EU to always keep this prospect alive or, as our friends across the water like to say, to keep the light on.  To do that, a lot would have to change in the UK.  Is it possible to realise that prospect in the next decade or two?  Is there a level of sourness in other member states that we cannot get past at this stage?  More importantly and more realistically, over the next five to ten years, how can we chart out a process that keeps the UK-EU relationship closer than perhaps envisioned in this trade and co-operation agreement?  How can we maintain that relationship and what part can member state parliamentarians and MEPs play in that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#G00600","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Members will be aware of the memorandum of understanding between the EU and the UK on financial services.  It is, however, merely an opportunity for dialogue and does not move things along very much.  Looking at the narrative around this, it remains to be seen whether the City of London is enthused about equivalence and all of the restrictions that might come with it.  There is a feeling that the lack of equivalence is already priced in to the way in which the city is now operating.  Relocation is taking place and investment is being reassessed.  Changes are being felt in the City of London but whether there is an enthusiasm to set down the rules for the conditions for equivalence remains to be seen.  The memorandum has to be formally ratified by the two parties, which is expected to take place in the next few months.  It is also contingent on many other issues, be they the protocol, energy or other issues related to the level playing field, and all of them are connected and mutually reinforcing.<\/p><p>If we talk about where to go to try to create a better relationship between the EU and the UK, obviously, these things have to be settled quickly and as soon as possible, and the sooner the better.  It is critically important for Ireland.  For example, 65% of funds held in Dublin are managed funds out of the UK or the US and consequently, we have a financial services system that is more Anglo-American than European.  It is in our interests that there is a financial equivalence.  We will certainly drive that.<\/p><p> The speech that I gave before Christmas - I thank Deputy Richmond for remembering that - was based on the assessment that a majority of young people in the UK supports being members of the European Union and all of its values, as does a majority in Scotland, a majority in Northern Ireland and a majority in many of the big cities across the UK.  It was to try to remind those people that they had not been forgotten and there would always be a voice in the European Parliament to ensure that they understood that if there was a change of government at the least and a change of hearts there I, for one, would be advocating for readmission of the UK.  We also have to remember the UK was a difficult member of the European Parliament.  It was slightly semi-detached all the time by being outside Schengen, with opt-outs on freedom, security and justice, not being in the eurozone and not being involved in all the big issues such as the eurozone crisis and the migrant crisis.  I am not sure there is a massive enthusiasm.  It depends now on what happens with the constitutional set-up of the UK, whether there is a Scottish referendum and whether Scotland comes in.  All of those issues remain to be seen.  We are still in a holding pattern in that respect.<\/p><p> I mentioned earlier what I think the member states can do.  I mentioned the structure.  The Good Friday Agreement is important.  The scrutiny function of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs is an important aspect of that.  We all have links with Northern Ireland.  We all have links, culturally and socially.  We have family in Northern Ireland.  It is important that we tailor our rhetoric in order that it is understood that we are interested in representing all of the communities and that we really are about bringing people together.  That is why I support the shared island vision.  That language that we use is critically important.<\/p><p> As well, the committee might think about the joint consultative working group, which is an element of the withdrawal agreement, by figuring out who are the officials who are dealing with that, who are inputting into that and thereby being able to call on them to answer a question that the committee might have.  That is a group that is meeting on a monthly basis that feeds into the joint committee on the withdrawal agreement.  Identifying those officials and being able to call on their insight would be useful for the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Andrews.

Ireland is hoping to get &euro;915 million from that.  There are reports in the media that the European Commission has asked Ireland to step up action to tackle aggressive tax planning by multinationals, which raises the issue of corporate tax rates, digital taxation, etc.  Has Mr. Andrews a view on where stands Ireland's application in the first instance and on the bigger issue of corporate tax rates, digital taxation etc.?  We probably need a meeting all of its own to deal with that issue but I would appreciate it, were Mr. Andrews to give an initial reaction to it.

One of the critical ways in which the agreement was arrived at in July last, when the frugal four governments were anxious about the lack of contingency associated with the allocation of the RRF, was that there would be these measures put in place.  We are used to the country-specific recommendations that come out annually from the Commission and require each of the member states to develop social policy, economic policy and fiscal policy in line with the overall direction of travel in the EU - let me put it that way.  I am not surprised that there is a reference here to aggressive tax planning.  The big issue here is the initiative of President Biden and what that means for the Irish corporate tax rate.  We have been clear all along that we are open to whatever comes out of an OECD process so that there will be a global tax regime that allows for reasonable tax competition.  That has been Ireland's position consistently.  If the OECD goes down the road of finding a solution that is acceptable to the US and to the EU and to others in the OECD, then it would be very difficult for Ireland to resist that.  That is the reality of the situation.<\/p> <p>  There are two big meetings coming up.  The G20 is meeting in July and October.  It is more likely that an agreement will emerge in October.  As I understand it, the US Treasury officials are just reading themselves slightly into their brief under the Biden Administration and July is a little soon.  Certainly, by October, we will see the shape of a potential agreement.  This is all happening very quickly.  The proposals in the Biden Administration, for its own corporate tax rate but also for the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, tax rate around intellectual property, are very significant for Ireland if adopted but the landing ground is probably going to be somewhere a little less than what is proposed.  Instead of 21%, the GILTI rate might be in the late teens.  It is a watching brief.  Ireland has always been nimble in arguing its point.  As long as we retain tax autonomy, we will be able to safeguard our industrial model.<\/p> <p>  I would agree with the view that if this proposal had come along 20 years ago, we might not have been able to cope with it.  I agree with the view of Mr. Seamus Coffey that it probably will not impact on investment currently in Ireland but it could have an impact on investment in the future, that is, the foreign direct investment, FDI, pipeline that has been positive.<\/p> <p>  On the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, this has been a big green jersey effort.  All of the MEPs tried to make an impact and tried to safeguard Ireland's interest in the BAR.  It was an outworking of the July 2020 European Council.  The outcome is slightly less than we had initially hoped for but it is still a positive one.  It is between 20% and 21% of the overall total or &euro;1.06 billion out of &euro;5 billion, but it is not settled yet.  There are still discussions going on at European Parliament level.  There will be a vote next week in the budget committee.  I am continuing to engage with the French rapporteur on that file - Deputy Harkin will be aware that is a tricky enough discussion to have - but we are not alone.  There are other smaller member states impacted by this, namely, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, that have shown a common way of thinking about this with Ireland.  Whatever the outcome, it is quite positive for Ireland.

Mr. Andrews mentioned that the UK sometimes were difficult members.  That is true but in the political day-to-day aspects of the European Parliament, EP, with very few exceptions I found that the UK MEPs were good colleagues.  Maybe to some extent we had not just a shared language; we had shared levels of understanding.  Barry mentioned the connection in financial services.  We also had a shared approach to the law etc.  We often said that within the Council, the UK sometimes did part of the heavy lifting.  That was absolutely true within the Parliament as well.  If, for example, there was a British rapporteur on a particular dossier, while the political perspectives might be different there was definitely a connection and a shared understanding.<\/p><p>That is now gone.  What bridges are being built and what connections are being made, based on Mr. Andrews's personal experience within his group?  What does he see happening in other groups, and what connections are being made there?  He mentioned that he is talking to the French rapporteur and that it is tricky.  There are many issues that are tricky.  Some battles can be won and some things can be influenced, and sometimes one has to recognise that they cannot be.  Mr. Andrews spoke about corporation tax earlier.  Year after year I saw the majority within the Parliament in favour of serious reform here increasing.

I was not in the European Parliament when the UK MEPs were there.  I was one of the ghost MEPs for eight months so I did not have the opportunity to appreciate their contribution but I certainly heard hearsay that the UK Liberal Democrats had a very influential voice in our group, which is the Renew Europe Group.  Their loss will be felt not just in the European Parliament by Ireland but also in the European Council.  I have always imagined a great Whitehall X-ray machine that looks at all the proposals from the European Union from a common law perspective and from a free trade perspective, on which Ireland and the UK are aligned.  It is accepted that that is a tremendous loss.  Even in the academic space, UK universities had big European law departments that are gone now or are not as significantly resourced as they used to be.  These are all big issues for Ireland and that is why it is great that we are putting more resources into Erasmus and trying to step up our consular and diplomatic representation across all the EU member states.  The loss of the UK will be, and is, sorely felt by Ireland.  There is no doubt about that.<\/p> <p>  We are getting through this bit of it and now we want to set up a parliamentary assembly.  It is important that the UK is open to that.  We wanted to highlight that with the committee today, to keep an eye on whether the UK is going to lean into that proposal within the trade and co-operation agreement, because that is how we will develop those links into the future.  It is that proximity and the margins of these types of meetings that will enhance the EU-UK relationship and the Ireland-UK relationship.  They have so much to contribute to us.  The French are very important allies but they say there is no such thing as a permanent alliance, there are just permanent interests.  The Brexit adjustment reserve has been an exercise in selling the green jersey.  All the MEPs from Ireland have been developing contacts within their groups and with other groups.  There are no Irish MEPs in the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;D, group, which is the group with which Labour and the SDLP are aligned.  That is a significant loss.  It is a huge group within the European Parliament with no Irish MEPs so we have to reach in there from time to time and continue to develop links there.  Part and parcel of our daily work is developing those networks and alliances.  From time to time we pull in the same direction but we could probably do more of it.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will leave Mr. Andrews with a final question.  Noelle O'Connell from European Movement Ireland has written to the committee highlighting a recent Red C poll.  No doubt Mr. Andrews has access to these figures but I will highlight a few of them.  On a positive front, 84% of the people surveyed agreed that Ireland should remain as part of the EU.  That is really strong and is reflective of what people are saying on the ground.  One hears it through the media as well.  Interestingly, only 35% felt that in order to deal with a crisis such as Covid-19, Ireland and other member states should give the EU more control over healthcare policy.  I assume that is a reaction to the roll-out of vaccines in the European Union.  There is a weakness there.  Some 29%, which is a very low figure, agree that there should be more political and economic integration in the EU, even if that means member states lose control over economic policy such as tax.  That is a very strong and loud message about protecting our own sovereignty in economic decisions.<\/p> <p>  Going back to a positive statistic, which will lead to my question, 71% of people interviewed in that Red C poll agree that the EU should do more to regulate digital media platforms, including online sources of news, information sharing platforms, social media, etc.  I acknowledge that Mr. Andrews's committee deals with digital trade and that this is not his area.  However, I am thinking about this in light of the fact that 52% of the people interviewed believe that we need to hold the Conference on the Future of Europe to reform the EU, which is a low enough percentage.  Does Mr. Andrews think we can make progress on the debate about trying to regulate digital media, in light of the Irish people's opinion that we would stand stronger together as a European Union bloc on an issue like this, in order to take on the big tech companies and the difficulties and trouble we have with some social media platforms?  Is this something on which we can make ground at a European Union level, rather than having to wait for discussions at the Conference on the Future of Europe?  I would appreciate Mr. Andrews' opinion on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#J00300","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":75,"content":"<p>The Conference on the Future of Europe is due to report in the spring of next year, which is not very far away.  It is a very ambitious timeline.  It is worth listening to citizens and making sure it is a proper exercise in participatory democracy.  If there are strong views emerging on those issues, particularly among young people, we should make every effort to absorb that in the way we develop public policy.  The figures the Chairman quoted are very interesting.  That 84% is probably the highest in Europe and we are consistently the highest in that regard.  We are all remainers, to use the UK terminology.  However, the further integration and deepening of European powers is a very different question.  While it is not surprising that only 29% support an EU tax policy, there are other elements of that poll that are very interesting and it would be worthwhile taking them apart.  The Chairman referred to a figure of 52%.  A potential treaty change was also acceptable to 52% of people and there was also a positive attitude towards security and defence policy, which seems extraordinary to me.  We have to be sensitive.  It would be useful if Ms Noelle O'Connell came before the committee to unpack all of that.<\/p> <p>  On the digital side, Ireland is perceived in a certain way in the European Parliament.  There is a sense that we are a bit light-touch with the large digital platforms we host here, which invest so heavily in Ireland and employ so many people.  A lot of attention is drawn to the Data Protection Commissioner.  There is a sense that her office could do more and that is compounded by the tax position.  We are seen as a problem child as far as the digital space is concerned.  It is an area on which we need to focus and watch out for our reputation.  It is a very difficult area that lies ahead of us.  Deputy Harkin made a point about the UK and how its absence will be felt in some of these spaces.  We have a little bit of a crisis of influence.  I have written previously that most of the loose regional groups in the European Parliament are just that - they are geographically contiguous with each other as they share a region or borders.  Ireland sits out in the Atlantic Ocean slightly by itself and that makes it a little more difficult to defend our interests and reputation.  Hopefully we can continue to work on those issues.  The 13 Irish MEPs will continue to do what little we can and we will keep in touch with the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2021050500002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry Andrews"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":76,"content":"<p>Mr. Andrews was nearly out the gate with Deputy Harkin but he is not out yet.

Deputy Richmond was very generous in referring to one of his speeches and, in that same good spirit, I should mention that Mr. Andrews was very appropriate in his use of the term some months of \"gunboat diplomacy\".

The Senator mentioned the massive increase in direct ferry traffic between Ireland and France and compared with January 2020, the figures are approximately six times greater for the connections, which is important.  The energy connection, the Celtic interconnector, is a critical piece of infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  We are in the same group as French President Macron's people so it is dominated by our French colleagues.  Ms Nathalie Loiseau, a former European affairs Minister for France, is in our group and she is our interlocutor on the Brexit file.  We develop good connections with France all the time.  It is often said the European Union is a German train with a French engine and, historically, a British brake.  The British brake is gone but the Franco-German project will require our greatest attention.  It is why we need to up our game in all these spaces.  The Hanseatic idea has been developed whereby we would have loose alliances with Nordic and Baltic countries, or the Netherlands and like-minded states across the European Union.  These are temporary alliances and from time to time we allow the French to speak, particularly on the agriculture and fisheries files.  I hope they will do this for the climate files, as the French are very progressive on the Paris climate accords and ensuring it is stitched into trade agreements and enforceable.  We should really push our values across the globe.  The idea of strategic autonomy has been around for years.  We consume a large amount of UK media and almost no French or German media, which is a major problem.  I do not know how we can solve it.

The committee met last week in private session with Mr. Corr to hear his evidence on the matter.  In the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" programme, it was alleged that dossiers, which apparently included sensitive medical and educational material on children involved in dormant court cases, were compiled and maintained over a number of years by the Department of Health, allegedly without the knowledge or consent of the parents of those children.  The committee thanks Mr. Watt and his officials for the provision of briefing materials relating to this matter over the past few weeks.  However, the committee is not entirely satisfied with some of the responses provided and the relevant issues will be raised again today.<\/p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentations they make to the committee.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at this meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  These are normal parliamentary procedures that exist to ensure our proceedings today are conducted in a constructive and fair way.

This is the first time I have been before this committee since being appointed to my role.  I am looking forward to working with the committee in the period ahead on the various challenges the health system faces, on which the members will be engaging with us.  I am joined by a number of my colleagues this morning.  I thank them for all the work they have done, particularly over the past two months, in responding to these allegations.  A significant amount of time has been put in, by colleagues who are here with me and by others who are not, in responding to these allegations, during a period when the Department was very busy dealing with issues relating to the pandemic and the variety of other issues with which we deal.  As it is my first time here as Secretary General of the Department, I also thank my colleagues more widely in the Department for all their work over the past 16 or 17 months in dealing with the challenges we face due to Covid.  The enormous contribution people have made and the enormous work and effort put in embodies what is great about the Civil Service and the public service.<\/p> <p>  I have been invited to discuss matters arising from allegations made in the \"RT&Eacute; Investigates\" broadcast that has been mentioned.  It is important to highlight the context in which these allegations were made.  The Minister for Health is named from time to time as a defendant in litigation cases.  This was the situation in a number of cases dating back to the early 1990s related to special educational needs taken against the State.  In approximately 230 of these cases the Department of Health and the Department of Education are co-defendants, and 29 of these cases remain open.  They could be active or dormant but they are open in that they have not been settled through mediation or court settlements.  As is the practice, both Departments are jointly represented by the Chief State Solicitor's office, under the co-ordination of the Office of the Attorney General.  The long-standing approach of both the Department of Education and the Department of Health to students with special educational and health needs is to seek to ensure the provision of the appropriate services for those students as best they can.  It is only where the suitability of such services is contested that litigation ensues.  The Department always seeks, in the first instance, to resolve proceedings on appropriate terms where possible.  The majority of concluded cases have been resolved by the parties involved through mediation and not by the courts.  That is an important point to emphasise.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the allegations previously brought to the Department of Health's attention in February 2020 through a protected disclosure were subject to an independent review by senior counsel.  This was completed in November 2020 and published on 21 April last.  I have shared a copy of this review with the committee.  The Chair and I spoke about this.  The reason for the delay in sharing that with the committee was to ensure that the rights of the discloser were protected, that consent had been received and that we had gone through all the necessary processes to ensure that.  The committee will be aware that this review assessed an allegation of gathering and sharing of information regarding special educational needs litigation related to correspondence and spreadsheets.  It found that there was no basis for a reasonable belief of wrongdoing, as defined in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  It also outlined that the information shared between the parties is consistent with, and typical of, the sort of information that arises in such litigation.  The report is very detailed and goes through the types of information that were provided by the whistleblower to counsel.  It sets out the context, conclusions and assessments on foot of the review.<\/p> <p>  Following the RT&Eacute; broadcast and the allegations it contained, I set up a team in the Department to establish the facts surrounding specific allegations made in the programme and related articles on the RT&Eacute; website.  The team was supported by three independent barristers who acted as external documentary review counsel.  This, in effect, involved going through files and establishing what was on them and the extent to which the allegations were made were true.  This report was also published on 21 April and a copy has been made available to members of the committee.<\/p><p> I will set out some important facts that have been established based on this independent review.  First, the Department of Health has never gathered sensitive medical or educational information on children involved in court cases in the manner portrayed by RT&Eacute;.  Second, there is no evidence the Department of Health was secretly compiling dossiers on children with autism involved in special educational needs litigation, as alleged by the RT&Eacute; programme.  As a co-defendant in litigation cases, the Department of Health may have documents on file that form part of the proceedings.  Such files contain information arising in the course of the proceedings, including the pleadings and correspondence received from all parties, including plaintiffs.  Most of the information on file includes the information provided by plaintiffs in the course of their pleadings setting out the case they wish to make and the basis on which they are taking a case against the State.  I think there has been some misunderstanding about the nature of the information that is held.  Most of the information was provided by the plaintiffs or provided in pursuit of their action by their legal representatives.  There is no evidence that the Department of Health is prying on families.  I use the word \"prying\" because that was the term used in the RT&Eacute; programme.  I am not entirely sure what was meant by that but the word is generally meant in a pejorative way, suggesting something underhand or covert, and there is absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever.  There is no evidence the Department of Health gathered information that was beyond instructions as part of the normal defence of a litigation case.  Based on the review from the evidential barristers, this was confirmed in the original review by Conleth Bradley.  The information held on file was of the type one would expect to see in cases such as these.  I have had a chance to look through some of the summary information and it is of the type one would expect to see: the name of the plaintiff, his or her legal representative, the case he or she is making, the status of the case and so on, along with accompanying documentation, in the main, as I said, provided by the plaintiffs.  There is no evidence the Department of Health sought updates or reports on plaintiffs directly from schools or the Department of Education.  There is no evidence the Department of Health sought clinical reports on plaintiffs directly from clinicians.<\/p><p> There are data protection issues, which the various papers identify, and we welcome the inquiry by the Data Protection Commission, which is investigating data collection practices in this area.  Of course, the Department is co-operating with the Data Protection Commissioner and will gladly take on board any recommendations the commission may have in respect of how we could do better in this area, if that is the conclusion and recommendations arising from the review.<\/p><p> I know the headlines generated by the programme have caused distress to some of the families concerned.  Accordingly, the Department of Health appointed an independent support liaison officer to engage directly with the 29 families involved in these allegations.  I have personally written to each of the families through their solicitors on file offering an opportunity to engage with him.  I have also endeavoured to keep in touch with stakeholder organisations.  On 1 April, I provided an update via open letter and further on 21 April, when the two reports were published, and I shared these with the organisations.  I again underlined that their role representing many patients and families affected by autism is valued.  I continue to be committed to engaging with them and informing them of updates on this issue as we go forward.  The mission of the Department of Health, and the mission of me and my colleagues, is to improve the health and well-being of people in Ireland.  The core priority of the Department over the past year has been the response to the Covid pandemic.  The intense work in continuing to respond to the impact of the pandemic on our nation's health and on the services we deliver will continue long after society has reopened and the last vaccine has been administered.<\/p><p> I look forward to our discussion today.  I assure the committee of our commitment to delivering on the Department's priorities.  The health and well-being of the people who use the health service is at the centre of all the decisions we take within the Department.  I am very happy to engage with any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Watt.

I am not in the practice of disclosing the contents of private conversations but I did note that the conversation was reported in the papers, which was a bit of a surprise.

We were, however, aware of the issues and were involved in correspondence with them, setting out our position, so we had some sense of the allegations that had been made.  We were conscious of two things: first, that the allegations were extremely serious and would cause distress to families if they were made publicly and, second, that we did not believe the allegations were true.  I wanted to ensure that the director general of RT&Eacute; in her role understood the gravity of the allegations and that they were as serious as could be.  It was suggested that officials of a Department were prying on citizens or engaged in covert operations, secret dossiers and so on.  This type of language and these types of allegations are serious.  First, I wanted to make sure that the director general understood the seriousness of the allegations, which after the conversation I think she did.  Second, based on what I had seen and what had been brought to my attention, and based on the whistleblower's report, which I had understood RT&Eacute; had at that stage - elements of it if not all of it; the whistleblower himself had certainly briefed people on it - I wanted to say to the director general that we did not believe the allegations were correct, and I set out why we did not believe they were, and that I did not think it was appropriate for RT&Eacute; to make such serious allegations.  That was the basic sense of the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":93,"content":"<p>Post the broadcasting of the programme, has the Department had subsequent discussions with the director general or any other senior official in RT&Eacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#B00700","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":94,"content":"<p>Not with the director general, but I have spoken to others.

We were as uneasy and as appalled as anybody else when we saw the programme.  Officials in the Department were as upset about what was said and the distress that it may cause families, as well as the fact that the allegations were untrue.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy in that if it is established, which it might be subsequently, that there is no validity behind these allegations, which will be up to others to decide, the damage, unfortunately, still will have been done.  People may not necessarily look back at what the final outcome to this is.  They will have watched the programme or heard the discussion about it.  Unfortunately, no matter what the outcome is, trust can be eroded.  The Deputy is correct that no matter what happens, that is a regrettable outcome of this.  Where responsibility lies for that is for others to decide.<\/p> <p>  On the question about cases taken, I will reiterate the point that the majority of cases do not go to court.  Only two of the 230 cases had actually gone to court.  Most of these are settled.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider issue, which I guess is the kernel of the Deputy's question and which is a policy question, about people taking cases against the State in order to improve access to services.  There is a question about the State's position about whether it should contest or accept them.  As we said in response to earlier questions, in many cases the evidence presented by the plaintiffs is such that the State will accept, settle quickly and will not contest the case.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider policy question, however.  Citizens have rights and have the right to have those rights vindicated legally through the courts.  That is how our Constitution and our legal system works.  I do not think there is ever going to be a situation where we find that families are 100% satisfied with the service they receive.  There is never going to be a situation where everybody will be satisfied all the time.  That is the nature of it.  It is a contested and challenging space.  We would like a situation where it never came to people taking cases.  We would like a situation where the services provided were met to the satisfaction of all the families all the time.  Sometimes, however, people do not believe that and they want more and better.  They have a right to challenge that.<\/p> <p>  From the State's perspective, which gets to the absolute essence of the discussion, the question is what is the role of the State in this regard.  Should the State not contest the cases?  If the State did not contest cases, services would be provided not on the basis of laws passed in the Oireachtas and then the administration of those laws by Departments.  Instead, the prioritisation of service provision would be on the basis of who has access to the legal system and solicitors.  If Departments did not challenge or accepted the case whenever a service was deemed to be inadequate, in effect the system would be gummed up forever with legal challenges.  The basis upon which we actually administer schemes would fall down.  It would not be on the basis of need but who has access to legal representation.  Nobody believes such a course of action would be desirable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I understand the dimensions around this.

He has said there was no basis for those allegations, that they were untrue and had no validity behind them.<\/p> <p>  People are really struggling to marry those two things and there is an enormous responsibility, if these allegations are untrue, to comprehensively prove so, because the reputational damage being done is immense.

Clearly, our prying on families and having secret dossiers would be inappropriate but that did not take place.  I know Senator Hoey is not talking about those ethical practices, she is referring to whether sharing information and challenging the cases is ethical.<\/p> <p>  On the sharing of the information, it is seen as an efficient way for co-defendants to try to manage the cases efficiently and resolve, mediate and settle the cases.  It is based on administrative efficiency rather than having one part of the case in one part of the system and so on, because the Department of Education, the HSE or the Department of Health could be involved.  It makes sense for the information to be shared so that we have one file on all the different elements relevant to the case and its potential settlement.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of sharing the information, we are satisfied of the administrative necessity and legality.  Can we share that better and be more secure about it?  Yes, of course.  We are looking at that and accept we can always do better.<\/p> <p>  The other ethical question is about service access and that is the key question here.  We are trying to improve services.  It is about, all the time, trying to improve services so that families do not have to take cases, the system provides the best possible services and, where possible, families are happy or content but, at least, accept more is being done or they are getting the supports they can.  Ultimately, that is the objective and what we are about in the Department.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant improvements in recent years.  Significant investment has taken place and enhanced services have been provided for people with special educational needs right across the area.  Of course, we all know we can do better and that is the objective.<\/p> <p>  On the wider ethical question about contesting cases, I have nothing further to add to what I said to Deputy Kenny, in that there is a fundamental public policy question about whether we want services to be allocated based on people's ability to access the law or administrative practice based on laws passed by the Oireachtas.  This is a fundamental question which goes way beyond our discussions this morning but it is absolutely central to how one manages areas such as this which are contested.

I will ask a number of quick questions.  I have read Mr. Watt's opening statement, in which he takes up this whole issue of his correspondence with RT&Eacute; after the programme aired.  What contact did the Department of Health have with the investigation unit of RT&Eacute;, and with Ms Dee Forbes, in advance of this programme going to air?  Mr. Watt's opening statement has five or six bullet points that absolutely refute what was aired and shown to the whole nation.  It seems incredible that these points were not all put to RT&Eacute; before the programme actually went to air, however.<\/p> <p>  I will bundle my questions together if that is okay.  Obviously, 29 court cases are pending but many more in a backlog have now been dealt with.  I am sure Mr. Watt has been overwhelmed by freedom of information, FOI, requests since this programme went to air.  On foot of this, do the Department's data protection or freedom of information officers have percentages as to what extent or how much of the files they had to redact when FOI data was issued to people?<\/p> <p>  Finally, when we bring all this down and get beyond the lofty levels of litigation and the Department of Health defending itself and setting out its stall, at the hub of it all we have children with special educational needs and their families.  As the final contributor today, I will conclude by speaking on this.  I was a teacher for 16 years before entering the D&aacute;il.  The fact remains that there are still many unmet needs for children and teenagers with special needs.<\/p> <p>  I ask that in taking on this role as Secretary General in the Department, Mr. Watt will look at one of the huge anomalies.  We have special educational needs organisers and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, on the Department of Health side.  There are many disparities and things not adding up.  The reality is that over the past 14 months of Covid-19, many of the supports laid on by the Department of Health, such as CAMHS, have not been fully up and running.  They have not met virtually.  They have not met the needs of children during this period.  That also needs to be looked it.  It is not all about litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#N00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I agree absolutely with those sentiments.

I absolutely agree with the Deputy that the key point here is not about litigation or \"Prime Time Investigates\".

The committee has taken the decision that it will specifically submit proposals to Government for consideration as part of the budget 2022 process.  Not only will we look at the spending measures but specific recommendations on how to deliver programmes across the Department of Social Protection, which has responsibility for community, rural development and the islands.  In this regard the committee recently advertised for public submissions.  I thank the stakeholders, groups and individuals who have submitted proposals.  These will be hugely beneficial to us in our deliberations. This morning, we will hear from two of the stakeholder groups - the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Family Carers Ireland.  Their representatives will give us a further insight into the submissions that we have received.<\/p><p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul throughout the entirety of the pandemic has quietly and professionally provided essential supports, to enhance the supports they traditionally provide, to families right across this country to support the most vulnerable and low-income households in communities.  The society received, on average, 440 requests for help every single day during 2020 and, in the first three months of this year, demand increased to 500 requests every day for urgent assistance from individuals and families.  Research commissioned by the society has shown that 43% of people reported experiencing at least one form of financial strain due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a quarter of them cut back on food or utilities, and 14% are behind with paying bills.  <\/p><p>In terms of Family Carers Ireland, there are over 500,000 family carers in Ireland so that is one in every three households.  As I have said before, carers are the hidden leg of the health service yet they are often forgotten about.  In the past 14 months the pandemic has been incredibly difficult for family carers.  It is not just the worry that the vulnerable person or persons being cared for will get sick but if the carer gets sick as a result of Covid then, for example, the older person being cared for or the person with a disability will be forced into hospital or long-term care thus putting further pressure on the already overstretched health system.  With that in mind, and in addition to their written submissions, the findings from Family Carers Ireland's survey, entitled Caring Through Covid that explored the experience of 1,307 family carers during the Covid-19 pandemic, will also be examined.  I welcome Dr. Tricia Keilthy, head of social justice and policy, and Ms Issy Petrie, research and policy officer, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul; and, Ms Clare Duffy, policy and public affairs manager, and Ms Catherine Cox, head of communications and policy, Family Carers Ireland.

I will begin by outlining the impact of the pandemic, which provides the immediate context for our priorities and has amplified the difficulties facing those in poverty.<\/p> <p>  As the largest charity of social concern in Ireland, SVP has continued throughout the pandemic to support low-income households remotely.  In 2020, we received over 160,000 requests for help and in the first three months of this year we received more than 45,000 calls from individuals and families struggling to make ends meet on a reduced or inadequate income.<\/p> <p>  Households are struggling with food and energy poverty, with social isolation and to meet their costs after their rent or mortgage are paid.  We also support households who live in temporary accommodation and direct provision centres, and those who are moving into new homes but without the resources to access bedding or household basics.  In our experience the pandemic has been hardest for those who are already struggling.  Due to the concentration of job losses in certain sectors the financial impacts, in terms of income loss, have been felt most by those who are already on low incomes who had more debt and fewer savings.  We commissioned Red C to conduct research and that shows the pandemic has caused financial pressures, including increased household expenditure on basics, an erosion of savings to meet ordinary living expenses, falling behind on bills and being forced to cut back on essentials such as food, heating and electricity.  The research found that over a third of one-parent families had cut back on heating or fallen behind on bills, and a quarter had cut back on food due to the cost.  Also, 42% of people who were unable to work due to illness or disability had gone without heating due to the financial pressure of the pandemic.  The impacts have not been felt evenly and 85% of those who found it difficult to manage financially before Covid have experienced some form of financial strain as a result of the pandemic compared with 23% of those who live comfortably.<\/p><p> Prior to the public health crisis, more than 600,000 people, including 200,000 children, were living below the poverty line.  Almost 100,000 of those children were in consistent poverty, so they were also experiencing deprivation.  These numbers, and the very high deprivation rates for groups such as lone parents, those who are unemployed and those who are unable to work due to illness and disability show that there is a significant mismatch between the cost of living in Ireland and the incomes of the least well off.<\/p><p> As well as the moral imperative to address this, we published research in 2020 that showed poverty weighs heavily on the public purse, costing the State &euro;4.5 billion per year.  This is spending that could be avoided if we invest now in adequate social protection.  In that context, we are calling for the social welfare system to progressively realise income adequacy for those using our shared safety net.  We propose that the minimum essential standard of living data, produced by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, be used as a benchmark for adequacy.  The pandemic unemployment payment and the work of the Department this year have shown how a strong social security system is a vital safety net and a public service of which we should be proud.  However, social welfare that provides an income below a minimum essential standard of living and meets only very basic needs, can instead contribute to locking people in a cycle of poverty without adequate means to access opportunities or participate fully in society.  Adequate social welfare helps people reconnect to the world of work and allows people to live in dignity.  This is not only what SVP believes is necessary but 96.7% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality also agreed that we should set social protection payments or supports at a level that lifts people above the poverty line, prevents deprivation and supports an adequate standard of living.<\/p><p> There have not been increases to core social welfare rates in recent budgets.  While increases last year in the child payment were very welcome, and are a well-targeted measure, these increases must be accompanied by higher core rates.  Without increasing core social welfare rates, many households will be missed and will continue to struggle to make ends meet.  Furthermore, child poverty can only be fully addressed when the minimum needs of the entire household are considered.<\/p><p> I will now highlight the situation of lone parent families, who continue to be the group most at risk of poverty in Ireland and the group we help most often at SVP.  Research shows that high housing and childcare costs combined with low levels of income mean that it is challenging for many families with children to make ends meet.  As well as investing in childcare and housing, we need to ensure that our social protection system is responsive to the needs of lone-parent families.  Lone parents face additional challenges because they both the primary earners in and primary carers for their families.  We recommend that jobseeker's transition payment be extended until the youngest child turns 18 because this will allow parents to access training and employment opportunities, as well as better in-work income supports.<\/p><p> On energy poverty, our submission outlines the difficulties people have faced over the past year in the context of higher utility bills.  However, many were already finding it difficult to keep their homes warm enough.  In 2019, of the people living in poverty in Ireland, 15% could not keep their homes warm enough, an increase of almost four percentage points on the previous year.  This is why energy poverty must be tackled as part of a just transition.  For the Department of Social Protection, we recommend that the fuel allowance be extended to those on the working family payment and those who have been on jobseeker's payments for less than a year, and that the length of the payment be extended to 32 weeks.<\/p><p> The cost of transport is a significant barrier for rural households and the cost of a car, which is vital for so many, is an additional &euro;59 a week.  We need to make sure that Local Link and an integrated rural transport system provides an accessible and affordable service throughout Ireland.<\/p><p> Finally, we recommend that poverty-proofing be embedded as an integral part of the policymaking process, rather than an exercise that takes place after a policy has been adopted.  All Departments need to produce an assessment of measures that relate to their own areas so we can see the impact of all policy and budgetary decisions.  A just recovery from the pandemic must begin with investing in our essential services, including social protection.  Everyone should be guaranteed an adequate income in order to participate fully in society, whether they are in work or not.  This is an investment in the long-term resilience of families and individuals and is vital to protect more people from poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Issy Petrie","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":423,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Petrie.

Our written submission, which members have received, provides an overview of the policy context within which informal care is situated in Ireland and the increasing dependence on family carers to meet the demand for long-term care and support for the reorientation of the healthcare system away from institutional care and towards primary and community-based care.  It also provides a summary of our key proposals relevant to the committee&rsquo;s work that Family Carers Ireland would like to see delivered in budget 2022.<\/p> <p>  I will give a brief background on Family Carers Ireland.  We are the national charity that supports family carers who care for loved ones, be they a child with a disability, an older person, or an adult with intellectual or physical disability.  As the Chairman stated, we are aware that there are more than 500,000 family carers in Ireland who provide a huge level of care and save the State &euro;20 billion per year.  This is the cost of replacement care.<\/p> <p>  The past 12 months have been particularly difficult for everybody in society but it has been a very difficult time for family carers.  They have witnessed their services and supports for their loved ones depleted and, in many cases, completely eradicated.  The blanket withdrawal of supports such as home care, respite, personal assistance hours and residential care during lockdown forced many family carers to care alone, around the clock and without the support of extended family and friends.  Parents of children with a disability lost the routine and relief of school, day services and essential therapies.  This left them in a situation where they were obliged to watch their children regress before their eyes.  Older carers with underlying health conditions were expected to cocoon.  As a result they became both isolated and reliant on others.  Even carers who were doing quite well prior to the pandemic became mentally and physically drained.  Many of them are now struggling in their caring roles.  In April of last year, Family Carers Ireland&rsquo;s conducted a survey, Caring Through Covid, which explored the experiences of more than 1,300 family carers and the nature of their caring situations during the pandemic.  The research found that the pandemic is having a profound impact on the majority of carers&rsquo; lives.  Not only are they caring without practical supports, they are also struggling financially and are seriously worried about what the future holds for them and the people they care for.  Despite this, family carers have continued to care for their loved ones, around the clock, to ensure that they stay safe and out of hospital.<\/p> <p>  Family carers have played a significant role in suppressing the virus in our communities but rather than being acknowledged and applauded, they have felt largely ignored and overlooked throughout the pandemic.  This is particularly the case when they were not provided with personal protective equipment or with priority testing, nor were they considered a priority for vaccinations.  The vaccination issue is probably the biggest upset for so many carers across the past year.  Family carers continue to feel this abandonment despite the statement in the programme for Government that \"Family carers are the backbone of care provision in Ireland.  They deserve support and recognition from Government.\"  They have not had this over the past year.  On a more positive note, however, as we emerge from this pandemic, we believe there is a real opportunity for Government to show family carers that it does care and to recognise their work.<\/p><p>This can be done in a number of ways by implementing three of the key commitments set out in the programme for Government, which are outlined in our submission.  The first is to deliver the carers' guarantee proposal.  This will guarantee the delivery of a core basket of services to family carers right across the country regardless of where they live.  These services include emergency respite, intensive one-to-one support for carers in crisis, training for family carers, targeted support groups and networks and access to the information and advocacy clinics in their local community.  While this will be led by the Department of Health, the carer guarantee is very relevant to the work of this committee given its aim of ensuring that all family carers have access to services regardless of where they live, whether in the heart of Dublin or in rural Connemara.  As such, this has the potential to end the postcode lottery of services and supports that we currently see across Ireland.  <\/p><p> Our second request is the funding of a refreshed national carers' strategy for family carers.  Given the period of significant health reform we are now in, including the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and the creation of a statutory home care scheme, both of which are predicated on the provision of care in the home, it is critical that the national carers' strategy is developed as a matter of urgency.  We need ring-fenced funding to ensure its delivery.  Again, the national carers' strategy straddles most Departments addressing crucial issues such as housing, transport, education and access to equipment and vital therapies and supports, many of which, again, have been eradicated over the past year.<\/p><p> Our last key point is to call for the introduction of a dedicated lifetime carer&rsquo;s pension for carers who have provided care for more than 20 years.  Rather than penalise this group of carers we need to recognise them.  We are pleased that we have seen progress on this issue in the last number of months and we hope to see that continue.<\/p><p> Last, but most important from a social protection perspective, we have to see reform of the means test, income disregards and allowable deductions for carer's allowance payments in the short term.  Taking a longer-term view, we would like to see this payment reclassified to one which is neither means tested nor taxable, similar to the foster care payment we have at the moment.  <\/p><p> To end, it is apt to quote from President Higgins's May Day speech just this week, where he stated \"Our definition of work must change, ... evolve and widen, to incorporate the ... role of ... carers as essential workers; workers far too long undervalued by society\".  Once again, I thank the committee for the invitation to be here today and we look forward to questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":426,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Cox.

There is a huge amount in them for us to digest and work on and, hopefully, much of that will make its way into our final pre-budget submission.  It is only right to say that, surely, of all the people affected in the pandemic, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Family Carers Ireland are voices for some of those who have been most affected.  This is particularly the case with lone parents when they were trying to cope with home schooling and the effect it must have had on their work, mental health and the pressure they are under.  Parenting within our household was challenging, but for a lone parent, particularly somebody struggling with poverty, it must have been close to unbearable.  Similarly, it must have been so difficult for carers, without the ability to access services or respite, to see light at the end of the tunnel.  I absolutely accept that sense of hurt put across by Ms Cox in possibly feeling abandoned during the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  I will direct my first questions to Ms Petrie.  We have identified those groups most at risk, which tend to be children living in poverty, lone parents and people living with disability.  These tend to be the people at most risk of persistent poverty.  Last year's budget went down the road of targeted supports about which I see much discussion.  Ms Petrie cited the Citizens' Assembly recommendation on social welfare payments.  I have a two-pronged question on this.  In terms of tackling poverty in the groups to which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is providing services, in Ms Petrie's opinion is it better to do this through targeted measures, as was attempted in the last budget, or is raising social welfare payments across the board a more effective way of tackling the problem?  That is a thorny issue. <\/p> <p>  If we are looking at an increase in the base rates, they should be index-linked and should not be a political football year on year, where we discuss the fiver in the pension or the fiver in the base rate.  If we are to look at setting a new baseline for our social welfare payments, where would the Society of St. Vincent de Paul pitch that?  Would it be pitched at a percentage of the average industrial wage or does the society have a set figure in mind in terms of, for example, the &euro;203 for jobseeker's allowance?  I will leave it at that.  There is enough in that question to allow Ms Petrie time to reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#C00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":428,"content":"<p>In terms of targeting versus universal increases, both contribute to the total adequacy of the household income.  There is a different balance in building up towards adequacy, depending on the household.  Targeted increases are obviously very important in recognising specific costs, such as the specific costs of a child; we were pleased to see high rates introduced for older children a couple of years ago.  However, increasing core social welfare rates is vital to recognising that it is the total household adequacy that is responsible for lifting families out of poverty.<\/p> <p>  As regards setting those rates, we very much advocate benchmarking them to the minimum essential standard of living as calculated by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, because that empirically reflects the actual cost of living.  Anything short of that builds in an ongoing inadequacy week after week.  That gap between adequacy and income is coming in as a cost and that cost builds up week after week.  Looking back at last year's figures, the Vincentian partnership recommended an increase to the core rate of around &euro;10.  That was to begin a pathway to reaching full adequacy by 2025.  Since we did not get that, we would obviously have to go further this year in order to continue on that pathway of reaching adequacy by 2025.  Does Ms Kielthy want to add anything to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Issy Petrie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":429,"content":"<p>To add to what Ms Petrie said in terms of appropriate benchmarks, average wages would be one option to look at.  As Ms Petrie pointed out, we need to ensure that people are able to meet their living costs and that there is no gap between income and the cost of a minimum essential standard of living because that is what causes people to cut back and go without.  That would be our experience in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  In terms of addressing the entire adequacy of the household, we cannot address child poverty unless we address adult rates and they are well below what is required to meet a minimum standard of living.  They have remained at &euro;203 for a number of years, which causes people on the lowest incomes to fall even further behind.  In this budget, we need to build on the need to address adequacy by increasing core social welfare rates as well as the targeted supports for children and people living alone and to recognise the cost of disability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00100","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":430,"content":"<p>I have umpteen other questions but I will wait my turn at the end if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":431,"content":"<p>Do Ms Cox or Ms Duffy wish to add anything?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00300","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":432,"content":"<p>It is a whole different discussion when it comes to carers and adequacy because carers are the only group within the social welfare system who if they are \"lucky\" enough to get a social welfare payment or carer's allowance, must provide full-time care to get it, which is at least 35 hours per week.  Many carers provide multiples of that.  It is almost a different question when it comes to adequacy.  What we said in our submission is that we need to begin the discussion around the adequacy of the carer's allowance.  Carer's allowance is &euro;219 per week at a maximum rate.  Almost half of the 89,000 carers who receive carer's allowance do not get the full amount.  They get a reduced amount because they or their partner have other means.  In very many cases, carers providing full-time care are on less than the basic social welfare rate and yet for that, they must provide full-time care so we need to begin a whole other conversation around adequacy rather than just measuring it in poverty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":433,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the submissions from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Family Carers Association.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is an organisation I would have worked closely with when I worked for Tusla in family support and I know the amazing work the society does.  Can the witnesses talk about the impact of Covid on people who would have been in work previously but are now on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and are facing a reduction in that payment in the coming weeks and months?  Many people with whom I would have spoken have lost a lot of their savings.  They have used a lot of their savings up and are really struggling to make ends meet and meet the costs of rent, mortgages and all of those payments people face.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about just transition.  It is a really important issue because many people on the margins and people who are really struggling are now faced with higher bills when winter arrives.  We have strange weather.  Somebody coming in this morning would have known that it was absolutely freezing.  People will be putting the heating on as children are going to school, which is impacting severely on people.

We cannot underestimate the important role the PUP has played in keeping households afloat, particularly in the initial stages of lockdown.  In our experience, we are finding families whose savings are gone and are now faced with long-term unemployment.  Our concern is that if the payment is unwound too quickly, people will be left in a very difficult situation.  This also raises the point we made earlier about ensuring that existing social welfare payments are adequate enough to meet the cost of a minimum need for households across the board.  We are quite concerned about levels of personal debt and problem debt arising from the pandemic.  We have had a lot of calls from people who are struggling with their utility bills and rent arrears.  There are protections for people who have been impacted by Covid in respect of rent arrears but there is no financial mechanism to help people to bridge the gap between what they are owed and what the landlord requires in terms of the property.  We would like to see the Departments of Social Protection and Housing, Local Government and Heritage work together to identify families and households with significant rent arrears and put additional supports in place because we do not want the public health crisis to be followed by a deeper housing crisis when we are already battling a housing crisis.  The issue of utility arrears came through quite strongly in the Red C research we commissioned but it is also coming up in data from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  The commission is seeing an increase in customers in arrears in respect of gas bills.  We need to see suppliers and the Government working together to address levels of debt.  This highlights the need to ensure that the fuel allowance is adequate and available to all households experiencing energy poverty.  At the moment, it is quite means-tested and families in receipt of the working family payment and the newly unemployed cannot access it but it is a very important form of support for households.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":435,"content":"<p>In respect of just transition, we believe it is really important that from the outset, the principle that the poorest do not end up paying the most for the transition and are protected from the costs of transition as far as possible is recognised.  In terms of the carbon tax, it is important that the fuel allowance, which is used to balance out that additional cost, reaches all those who need it - those on the working family payment and jobseeker's payments for less than a year.  We also think there is a strong argument for exploring the feasibility of a social energy tariff and how that would work in the Irish market.  There are many different forms that could take and that would need to be looked into.  It involves the different implications of the different options but removing the costs of environmental taxes and levies from those in energy poverty and those on the lowest incomes would be an option for lifting the weight of the carbon tax.  The PSO levy offers a way for those who simply do not have room in their budgets for their energy costs to keep incrementally going up and up as we transition to green energy, which is so important and brings a lot of opportunities.  The principle that the poorest do not pay the most for it needs to be embedded in that transition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Issy Petrie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":436,"content":"<p>I will answer the Deputy's question about young carers.

The Deputy is right: there are very inadequate supports for young carers across the country.  Scotland has 22 young carer officers in Glasgow alone.  Here we have one and he works with Family Carers Ireland so he is trying to cover the whole country.  Early intervention, such as support for these people in schools to allow them to move on to third level education, is so important.  Those supports are not there.  The survey carried out last year showed that, for example, young carers are more likely to be bullied than other young people their age.  They may also miss out on schooling because they have to care at home.  It may be difficult for them to study at home if there is caring going on in the family.  They can be vulnerable as a result, which is why it is so important the adequate supports are put in place for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine Cox","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":438,"content":"<p>The next member is Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#E00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I asked a question about the funding for policy development.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#E00300","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":440,"content":"<p>In our submission to the committee, we refer to funding that is provided for under the Department of Rural and Community Development.

I have a few very specific questions.  I will get down to nuts and bolts because we know what happens on budget day: the Government announces figures.  I wish to ask two questions about the carer's allowance.  First, have the witnesses any calculation as to how many people would get the full-rate carer's allowance if the disregard were increased to &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple from the present &euro;332 and &euro;665, respectively?  It would be very useful to get a figure in that regard.  Second, I want that disregard in the capital assessment because, as all my colleagues on the committee know, I have an obsession with the way in which the capital assessment is done.  It is totally bizarre right across the schemes.  My view - and I will be straight with the carers and everybody else - is that if the capital assessment system is to be changed, it has to be changed across the board, for all schemes.  Otherwise, we will get people trying to get from one scheme to another.  It will not work.  A thing like this has to be done evenly.<\/p> <p>  Only one thing puzzled me earlier.  I liked Family Carers Ireland's proposal.  I thought, \"Very nice, the &euro;50,000 is grand and is exempt.\"  There is the &euro;10,000 at &euro;1 and the next &euro;10,000 at &euro;2, but I could not understand why Family Carers Ireland left the &euro;4 rate in there.  That is 20% interest.  Are the witnesses from Family Carers Ireland telling me that at the bank you can get 20% interest?  They would be surprised who gets caught on this one, for example, rural communities in which a young couple have built their own house.  The parents have died and left the old farmhouse.  It might not be in great nick but it would be worth &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000 because any house in a country area is worth a lot of money now.  There are people who have just saved money and people who have got awards.  There are all sorts of ways people can have &euro;100,000 or &euro;120,000.  It is not an awful lot of money in a lifetime.  As was rightly pointed out, when a person are caring, that is not a profession.  We should forget about calling it a profession.  It is a vocation into which people enter, in most cases, voluntarily.  In most cases the family circumstances determine that.  Has there been any thought about this or was Family Carers Ireland afraid it would be a step too far?  It mounts up incredibly fast.  Once you go over whatever ceiling is set, whack, you hit this massive wall.  It works very badly against those being cared for as well - for example, people on disability allowance - if parents die and leave the house between two or three kids and they get their share out of it.  Suddenly, they are whacked completely in respect of it.  I know this is kind of nitty-gritty but this is what really makes the difference for the people who come into our constituency clinics.<\/p> <p>  May I ask the St. Vincent de Paul about lone parents?  All the surveys the Department has carried out highlight the fact that lone parents are the most disadvantaged group in society.  That is well known in the Department and has been well known for a long time.  For many people on HAP, the contributions they make as individuals amount to more than the local authority contributions.  In other words, they have to make extra contributions or they cannot get the properties.  Is the SVP finding that this is causing huge poverty among people?  Do the witnesses understand what I am saying?  If a person goes on the HAP scheme, in many cases, as well as paying the statutory contribution - in other words, the equivalent of the local authority rent - he or she will have to and is allowed to make an extra payment to the landlord in order to get the property.  In most cases, certainly in Galway city, an individual will wind up paying that extra payment or he or she will not get a property and will be on the street.  That seems to me to be causing an awful lot of poverty among people in general, but particularly people such as those in one-parent families.  Is the SVP coming across that?<\/p> <p>  I have another question for the  SVP.  As well as the rates, one issue that comes across to me is that the old discretionary emergency payment is gone and that everything now is systemised into something and a means assessment is done.  However, people could be very short of money for reasons other than the money coming into the house.  They could have a partner who has a gambling addiction, a drink addiction or any other addiction.  There could be all sorts of reasons a person runs out of cash.  In the old days the community welfare officer knew this on a personal basis and could bail the person out.  That seems all to be gone and we do not seem to have any safety net for the crisis situations.  Is the SVP coming across more and more people who are literally without money?  It is not as simple a thing as money not coming in.  In some cases the person who needs the money is not getting it.<\/p> <p>  I have just one final point.  I am very interested in the cost-of-living basis for assessing the adequacy of the average wage.  I am very much against index-linking because that keeps people at the same level of poverty they are at all the time.  There has to be a way of indexing it against other parameters that make sure that if we are way behind with our social welfare rates, we have our target to catch up with, even if it is not done in one year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#E02000","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":457,"content":"<p>We might start with Family Carers Ireland on this occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#E02100","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.

To be honest, we do not know.  What we do know, however, is that we have a scheme that is not means-tested and for which only full-time carers are eligible to apply, and that is the annual carer's support grant.  We know that the total number of people who received that last year was 116,000 so we know it probably would not exceed that.  At the minute we have 89,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance.

In the review the Department did on carer's allowance, it estimated that any increase in the income disregard for carer's allowance up to the level of average industrial earnings, which it committed to doing towards 2016, would cost &euro;55 million.  Those were the Department's figures.  That is probably an overestimation but those were the figures the Department put out.<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the Deputy's second question, which was interesting.  When he was asking the question I was wondering if I would tell the truth or tell a lie and say that I thought about changing the &euro;4 down to &euro;3.  It did not dawn on me to do so.  The Deputy is right that it is &euro;1 in the first &euro;10,000, &euro;2 in the second &euro;10,000 and then it goes up to &euro;4.  The Deputy is right and it is a valid point.  The reason we asked for the capital disregard to be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 is that it is in line with the disability allowance, which allows that so we felt the precedent had been set.  The Deputy is right about the capital disregard at &euro;20,000 for families, particularly parents who are caring for an adult child.  They scrimp, save and do without in order to make provision for that child or adult child when they are no longer there and a capital disregard of &euro;20,000 is nothing for them.  We have had that discussion with the Commission on Pensions as well.  The Deputy made a very valid point on why &euro;4 may not be the best option and &euro;3 might have been the more obvious choice.  I will take that on board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":464,"content":"<p>We fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's assessment on HAP.  We routinely come across such situations where households are put under significant financial pressure to pay the top-up.  I can think of one example where a lone parent was in minimum wage employment and was paying a direct top-up of &euro;100 per week to her landlord.  This causes awful difficulties for families.  It puts them at risk of becoming homeless and it causes them to cut back on basics, such as food and utilities.  That is the main reason people approach St. Vincent de Paul for help.  We will again be emphasising the need for more social housing that is built or acquired by the local authorities or approved housing bodies in our submission to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We also need to look at the HAP limits and on whether they are reflective of market rents.  If not, we need to look at increasing those.  At the same time we must be mindful of the need for rent certainty measures so that HAP is not inflating rents.  We also need to consider expanding homeless HAP provision to all counties outside Dublin and Cork because we are seeing more families in smaller towns and other areas being impacted by the HAP top-up.  It is causing difficulties across the country.<\/p> <p>  We have seen the impact of the closure of some local offices and how that has impacted the access that households have to exceptional needs payments or urgent needs payments when they need them at times of crisis.  We particularly see the impact it has on people who had extra health and hospital charges prior to Covid, including travel.  It is quite difficult to get access to that payment on short notice if one needs to ring up or if one cannot visit the local office.  That causes difficulty for people.  It is a form of support and we have a close relationship with community welfare officers on the ground in terms of links there but we come across gaps in what the maximum a community welfare officer will pay is and what the cost of white goods is, for example.  Another big factor is the cost of funerals and bereavement.  That can cause significant difficulties for households and a lot of the support provided by the community welfare offices, which is helpful, is not adequate in meeting the real cost of bereavement and funerals.  Another issue we see routinely is that when someone moves into new housing, which is great, a lot of the local authority housing is not kitted out with flooring or white goods and this also causes great difficulties for low-income households.  The community welfare office grant that is provided does not cover the full cost of that either so that is where St. Vincent de Paul often has to stand in and provide support.<\/p> <p>  The final point was on the cost of living and the minimum essential standard of living data.  The gap between income from social welfare and the cost of a minimum essential standard of living for adults is &euro;47 per week and for a lone parent the gap can be up to &euro;80 per week.  When we talk about our social welfare rates, therefore, we need to ensure they are evidence-based and we need to progressively realise that we need to be more ambitious in where we see our social welfare and social protection system providing support.  As was mentioned, the Citizens' Assembly strongly supports a social protection system that provides a decent and adequate standard of living for people and prevents poverty.  We outlined in our submission that we need an &euro;8 increase in core social welfare rates but we also need proportionate increases for children over and under 12.  We will provide costings in our full pre-budget submission later this year.  We need to give a reminder of the cost of not investing in people's incomes.  Research that we published shows that the State spends &euro;4.5 billion every year through our public services dealing with the consequences of poverty on people's lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for the work they do every day for those they represent.  I have a number of questions for all the witnesses.  Benchmarking all social welfare rates across the board to the minimum essential standard of living is critical.  On top of that, the cost of disability and carers have to be considered.  That is what makes both of those groups unique, particularly carers because there is a cost of care that is not being recognised.<\/p> <p> I want to ask St. Vincent de Paul about poverty.  This is something that needs to be tackled in a big way and there needs to be a major focus on it, particularly as we come out of Covid as unfortunately it will no doubt have increased.  What steps can be taken, aside from the minimum essential standard of living, the poverty proofing and the other steps that are detailed in its opening statement?  Is there anything else the Oireachtas can do on poverty?  Is there anything that has been done internationally that has been proven to work?<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has put a lot of emphasis on the urgent and exceptional needs payments, particularly when we spoke about fuel costs, utility bills and debt.  St. Vincent de Paul is getting an awful lot of calls but is it getting any feedback from people who might have been in touch with their community welfare officer, who have applied and who have not been able to get the payment?  The difficulty we have is that we only get the figures for the number of people who have got an exceptional needs payment or an urgent needs payment.  We do not get the total number who applied and therefore, the number who have been refused.  It is a messy situation whereby one community welfare officer will give something and another would not.  The way it is made up is problematic.<\/p> <p>  On lone parents, child maintenance is crucial and it has been proven that where it is paid it does and can lift children out of poverty.  I hope that when the maintenance review group reports - towards the end of the year apparently - it will seek a statutory child maintenance service.  That is really important for lone parent families.<\/p> <p>  Of the calls that the St. Vincent de Paul has received last year and this year, does it have any further information on a breakdown on those who are at work or not at work and on the supports they are looking for?<\/p> <p>  I have a number of quick questions for Family Carers Ireland.  Has it had any engagement on the national carers strategy?  The last strategy was in 2012, which is a long time ago.  There was an understanding at that stage that money was tight and carers said they would step back and wait.  They did so and unfortunately they are still waiting.  On the total contributions approach that has been introduced for the State pension, has Family Carers Ireland seen any improvement or has it received any feedback on improvement to that system for carers?  Is the option of paying the carer's support grant in two instalments something that Family Carers Ireland will look for?<\/p><p>I spoke to a carer the other day who raised with me something that has not been raised in quite a while, which is the bin waiver for those with medical incontinence.

On her first question on poverty reduction measures, obviously social protection is a core component of this and we need to ensure people have enough income.  A lack of income is the main driver of poverty among households.  We also need to ensure people have access to good quality services.  This is why a whole-of-government approach is so important.  This is what is laid out in the roadmap for social inclusion, into which we are feeding as part of our work.<\/p> <p>  It is very important when we think about families, and particularly child poverty, that we ensure access to good quality affordable childcare.  We also need to ensure people have access to affordable housing, which means increasing the output of social and affordable housing.  We also need to ensure children can access education on an equal footing.  We want to see genuinely free primary and secondary education.  We need significant investment in schemes such as those for book rentals and hot school meals, and we need an end to voluntary contributions through providing adequate funding to schools.  This is what we will outline in our submission to the Department of Education later this year.<\/p> <p>  In other countries, and in the climate action Bill, we have seen the need to legislate for targets.  We have poverty targets but, for example, New Zealand and Scotland have legislated to reduce and end child poverty.  This is a very important mechanism to ensure we all work towards the same goal of ultimately eliminating child poverty.<\/p> <p>  Other suggestions we have made on what the Oireachtas can do include that we would love and welcome an Oireachtas committee looking at poverty and inequality.  We have seen the disproportionate impact of Covid on people living in poverty and we expect to see an increase in poverty.  It will be more important than ever to ensure those who experience it and are impacted by it are given a voice and their needs and experiences are highlighted in the work of our Oireachtas and elected representatives.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the fuel allowance, we wrote to the Minister for Social Protection in January when we saw that people on prepaid meters in particular were really struggling to keep their homes warm.  They did not have enough money to top up the meters.  We asked for an increase in the fuel allowance or an extension of the period.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.  We directed people to community welfare officers who were able to provide support for energy payments.  The community welfare officers have discretion, which in one way is an advantage but it can be a disadvantage if the support is not given on a regular basis to people who are struggling.  The restrictions, which meant people could not go into the office, also hindered access to the payment.  It is still there and is still an important form of support for people.<\/p> <p>  Child maintenance is very important.  We have made a submission to the review group on child maintenance.  In other countries where there is a statutory child maintenance system that is guaranteed, and where it is not means tested and fully passed through to the child, there is a significant decrease in child poverty and this is also very important.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the profile of people requesting our help, 70% of our calls come from households with children and the majority of these are headed by one parent.  We know this is because of the very high rates of poverty among one-parent families.  This year we have seen an increase in calls from people who had not requested our support previously.  These are people who have been on the pandemic unemployment payment for a long time and are facing issues with debt.  Their savings are gone and there is concern about long-term unemployment.  As we emerge from this crisis we must ensure that issues relating to poverty and inequality are top of the agenda from our point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":469,"content":"<p>Deputy Kerrane is correct with regard to the national carers strategy.  We got the first strategy in 2012 and at the time it was cost neutral.  As the Deputy said, carers held out and anything that could be done in that strategy was done.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government for a refreshed strategy.  We have engaged on this with Department of Health officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  We sent a proposal for a new strategy in September or October to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the Department.  We have not really seen much progress on this, to be honest.  We would like any support the committee could give us to progress it.  The strategy straddles all Departments.  It looks at housing, access to equipment and therapies for children and adults.  It is crucial that we get it and it is promised in the programme for Government.<\/p> <p>  The other issue raised is the carers' support grant being paid in two instalments.  There are different schools of thought on this and Ms Duffy and I differ slightly on it.  We put this out to carers very recently through an open forum and the unanimous feedback was that carers do not want it paid in two instalments.  Having said this, there are arguments as to why it would be beneficial to do it.  At present, it is not one of our asks.  We took it out of our most recent pre-budget submission.  We will review it again because there is a situation whereby unless people are caring in the second week in June they will not get the grant for the previous year whereas if it were done in two instalments they might get half the grant.  There are arguments for and against it.  It is not a priority for us at present but we will review it again.

Deputy Kerrane is absolutely right that three or four years ago there was a huge issue whereby people were going to be charged depending on the weight of their bins and there was uproar.  Joe Duffy fuelled a lot of that uproar.  People who care for someone who is incontinent will have much heavier bins.  When the Chair was Minister with responsibility for the environment he managed to secure &euro;7 million to put aside for an annual allowance of &euro;75 credit on the waste collection bin for households where incontinence care was provided.  Despite not months but years of trying we could not make it work.  The issue was identifying households where incontinence care was provided.  We could identify those households in the public system through public health nurses who provided incontinence pads but that left out all of the people who bought pads privately.  The public health nurses and the HSE rightly did not want to share data on who was receiving incontinence pads from them.  In the midst of all of this we had GDPR.  I do not know where the &euro;7 million is now but every effort was made to address the issue.   The other significant thing that happened was a rowback on pay by weight and households now have much more choice as to how they pay for their bins.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy's question on the total contributions approach and whether we have seen an improvement appears to be a simple question but it is complicated.  The Deputy is absolutely right that the main beneficiaries of the total contributions approach are meant to be family carers.  It has improved many of the legacy pension issues that existed for carers who take shorter periods of time out of the workforce to provide care.  If I take two or three years out of the workforce to care from my mother, the total contributions approach will very neatly plug that hole in my record.  If I take eight or nine years, it will still plug that hole.  Where the difficulty arises is for lifetime carers who have cared for more than 20 years.  It puts them beyond the protection of the homemaker's scheme or the home caring periods allowed under the total contributions approach and they are not protected.  This is why in our written submission and oral presentation to the Commission on Pensions we called for a dedicated pension for lifetime family carers who care for long periods.<\/p><p>As part of that submission we are saying, for people who take shorter periods out of the workforce a total contributions approach or TCA is quite a good solution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Duffy for providing clarity on the incontinence issue, which is hugely frustrating.

Ms Duffy is correct to say that the decision I, as Minister, took to move from pay-by-weight to pay-by-use provides a certain amount of flexibility that does ease the financial strain on that cohort of families.

Another support would be access to training.  When someone first becomes a carer, he or she very often has never had to care for somebody else, provide intensive care or lift or move someone.  A person would get access to that basic training when he or she needs it but also - again, in the community - to more intensive training if he or she is caring for somebody in the end-of-life stage.  Other things carers would get access to are advocacy, information and support.  The guarantee would provide carers with a core basket of services when they need them in their communities.  As an organisation, we would be able to provide that and support them with it.  That, in a nutshell, is really what the carers guarantee is about.  Importantly, there would also be one-to-one support.  For carers who are really in crisis and struggling, we provide one-to-one support.  We carry out a well-being assessment and, based on that, we provide an intensive, eight-week support programme that might include counselling for the carer and wider supports for the family.<\/p> <p>  There has been engagement.

We also have a consistent poverty measures which capture families and individuals who are also experiencing deprivation.  I refer here to those who are on low incomes and who are going without basics like suitable clothing, adequate nutrition and adequate heat.  We would also think that the minimum essential standard of living can also be a complementary measure because it captures the cost of living.  In other countries, housing costs are subtracted prior to any income being calculated and then that would form part of the definition.  In Ireland, we do not include the cost of housing.  As I mentioned previously, HAP and HAP top-ups tend to drive poverty among households on low incomes at the moment but that is not captured in our national statistics.  So, the measures are primarily income-based and are really important.  They allow us to track trends over time and allow comparisons with other European countries but they do not always adequately capture the cost of living in Ireland, which is very high and which causes people to go without.<\/p> <p>  On direct provision, the supports provided in centres are food and accommodation.  What we find is that many households and families with children have the same costs in respect of education.  A lot of calls relate to access to education for people who live in direct provision, books, contributions and any other costs that fall on parents at back-to-school time.  We found during the lockdown that the digital divide became very prevalent across all households but low-income households in particular.  We also found that children and those in third level education living in direct provision who did not have access to digital devices were struggling to keep up with their learning and online studies.

I also thank the 500,000 carers in Ireland.  It is important that we always thank those people providing care 24-7.<\/p> <p>  Staying with carers, I have been following up on refusals for carer's allowance recently.  The latest figures I have show the rate of refusal at 50%, or even above it.  There were some 18,700 applications in 2020, and more than 10,000 of those applications were refused.  Mention was made earlier of the means test not having been changed since 2008.  Obviously, the committee supports the need for change in that regard, and urgent change.  Regarding those refusals of applications for carer's allowance, and in the experience of Family Carers Ireland, do the majority stem from issues with the means test or are some of them connected with the care being given and the length of time involved?  I see a combination of those factors in respect of the applications for carer's allowance I deal with through my office.  Recently, I had one case concerning a lady who was &euro;9 above the means test limit.  She had to adapt her house, improve her heating and change her food supply purchases to enable her to take in and look after her mother.  That lady did not qualify for one cent from the State in supports.  This is a major issue.  I also raise the issue of those carers, the 51%, who get the maximum rate of &euro;219.  Perhaps the witnesses might comment regarding the average rate for those who do not get that maximum amounts, and what supports are available to them.  I believe the rate can be as low as &euro;10 per week, which is minuscule.  It is important that we highlight that people are providing 24-7 care for &euro;10 a week, which is unbelievable in this day and age. <\/p> <p>  Moving on to the representatives from St. Vincent de Paul, I thank them for everything they do.  I will raise some points, including some aspects mentioned earlier.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the growth of food banks and soup kitchens.  We seem to be seeing food banks and soup kitchens opening in every small town and village.  Unfortunately, that is where we are.  What is St. Vincent de Paul coming across regarding the situation and the opening of these food banks and soup kitchens?  Reference was also made to different social welfare payments.  I will highlight one, namely, the clothing allowance.  It is exceptional in being set at &euro;100, when someone qualifies for it.  However, general practitioners, GPs, are charging anything up to &euro;25 or &euro;30 to sign the form.  That is totally wrong, and the situation should be looked at urgently.  Equally, the whole area of exceptional needs payments must be examined.  I had several cases at the weekend where people were struggling and did not know that they could qualify for an exceptional needs payment, especially older people.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>  I turn now to the worrying figures brought to us this morning by the witnesses regarding the number of children in consistent poverty having grown to almost 100,000.  The witnesses already referred to the importance of school meals, and particularly hot meals.  The Government has put some funding into this area, but as we get out of this pandemic such school meals are going to be important.  This is an aspect that must be targeted.  Finally, from a rural point of view I am very interested in the &euro;59 that St. Vincent de Paul referred to in respect of the cost of the car.  I ask the witnesses to explain where that figure comes from.  I live in rural Ireland and note the problem with rural transport.  It is a major issue for all of us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#J00700","speaker":"1684"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":487,"content":"<p>We might start with the representatives from Family Carers Ireland and then move on to the witnesses from St. Vincent de Paul.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#J00800","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  I will start with the refusal rate.  There has always been a problem with social welfare refusal rates in general.  Regarding carer's allowance, however, I will speak honestly and say that in the cases I have dealt with, and I have been dealing with these cases for the last 13 years, what is most needed is good information at the beginning.  I refer to carers coming to us before they send in their applications.  We can advise and help them with those applications.  Applicants are often misinformed and in many of the cases I have dealt with, one of the most common reasons for refusal concerns applicants not providing enough information.  I say that quite honestly.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the reasons for refusals, I most often come across two things, namely, medical need, where the person is not considered sufficiently incapacitated to need full-time care, and the second aspect is the provision of full-time care.  To qualify for carer's allowance, it is necessary for the applicant to be providing at least 35 hours of care each week.  Those are the two major things we encounter.  Again, however, I reiterate that people will greatly increase their chances if they get the right advice at the beginning and fill out the application forms well.  I think sometimes there is a misunderstanding about the carer's allowance, and we must remember that it is not awarded because people are caring, but because they are caring full-time.  That is a significant body of work.  When we are supporting carers in receipt of the carer's allowance, we are not talking about light caring responsibilities.  We are, instead, talking about very high-level care.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the means test, I could not agree with the Senator more.  It is incredibly frustrating that the income disregard for carer's allowance has not budged for 13 years.  There also does not seem to be any appetite to increase it.  In our pre-budget submissions, we have included a proposal to increase the rate from &euro;665 to &euro;900 for a couple, but we actually just want to see the Department begin to increase it and to show an appetite and recognition in that regard.  There was a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement that the rate of the carer's allowance would keep pace with average industrial earnings.  It has not, and it has not even come close to it.  The other really interesting thing about carer's allowance, which people might not realise, is that the maximum rate of carer's allowance in 2021 is less than it was in 2009.  It is &euro;150 less.  We have never recovered from austerity.  Therefore, so much is connected with the means test.  <\/p> <p>  The other figure that is interesting for people to know is that in order to qualify as a household for full-rate carer's allowance it is necessary to have a total gross household income of less than &euro;37,500.  That is for a two-person household.  From &euro;37,500 to &euro;62,000, then, the rate of carer's allowance is tapered.  The Senator is absolutely right on this point.  When a household income of &euro;62,000 is reached, the carer's allowance is &euro;5 per week.  That is all.  People will also be getting the carer's support grant and the things that come with it, but that is all.  However, to me, those are not wealthy households.  They are also often households where either the mother or father has had to give up work in order to provide care.  Those households have much higher expenditure because they have additional costs.  I had one lady who did not get the carer's allowance because her husband earned &euro;64,000.  She had three children with profound disabilities.  They had just paid &euro;4,500 to get in a stairlift for their 18-year-old son.  That family got nothing because the father was on the extortionate rate of pay of &euro;64,000 gross.  Something must be done.  If I could leave one thing for this committee to consider in its future work, it would be that point.  This issue cannot fall on deaf ears any longer.  Something must be done with the income disregard.  In addition, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, something must also be done with the capital disregard, because it has not budged in the 13 years I have been knocking around this sector.  It has not moved nor is there any appetite to move it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":489,"content":"<p>I will answer Senator Wall's questions on food poverty and exceptional needs payments.  I will then pass over to Ms Petrie, who will comment on the cost of a car and how that figure is calculated.<\/p> <p>  At the start of the pandemic, the issue of food poverty really came to the fore for many organisations and not just St. Vincent de Paul.  That was especially the case when households were faced with the extra costs of having children home all day and the resulting extra demands on food budgets.  Any increase in household expenditure on basics such as utilities and food has much greater impact on those on lower incomes because a much larger proportion of such incomes goes on those basics.<\/p><p>What we see is that food and the food budget is the one area of discretion people have over their weekly budget, and when times are tough that is what people cut back on.  The rent and the utility bills are prioritised and families cut back on food.  It is often the parents going without food so their kids can eat.  The continuation of the school meals programme during the school closures was a vital form of support for many families.  It was really important that that continued, including through the holidays because holiday hunger is a real issue as well.  Moving forward, we need to start thinking of school meals as a core form of support for all children, provided in a universal way that is non-stigmatising.  It is really important that the European Commission has recommended that all member states adopt an EU child guarantee which would guarantee all children from disadvantaged circumstances access to a hot school meal every day, free education, free childcare and free healthcare as well as access to adequate housing.  That is a really important framework going forward and it relates back to Deputy Kerrane's question about what we can do about child poverty.<\/p><p> The exceptional needs payment and the level of support provided according to different needs need to be reviewed to ensure it is reflective of the actual costs and that people are not left with a gap between what the payment is and what the actual cost of their urgent or exceptional payment is.  We would like to see that piece of work done.  We need to ensure that the system still has discretion but that the levels of payment provided are reflective of the costs faced by households at the moment as well.<\/p><p> I will hand over to Ms Petrie, who will explain more about cars and the cost of rural transport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#J01000","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":491,"content":"<p>The &euro;59 in our submission comes from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice's minimum essential standard of living.

In my part of the country the St. Vincent de Paul and the carers do huge work.  I am sure Ms Cox knows Bernie Dowling down there, who does a lot work and week by week is always on to us and the Chairman about things.  Particularly in rural areas, where there may be older people living on their own and in not great conditions, the St. Vincent de Paul does great work.  These people may not have any close family or a lot of income.  The St. Vincent de Paul people never want to be identified - and that is all part of the organisation - but they are very much alert and alerting us to situations if needs be.<\/p> <p>  I was very interested in the debate this morning about the definition of poverty.  May I throw one thing out there?  I am not asking the witnesses for a direct answer to this, but maybe they could look at the definition of poverty.  In my view, they should add \"exceptional circumstances\" because the finest of people who can have the finest of incomes and the finest of comforts can for whatever reason fall into a trap.  Whether or not they are at fault is not the issue.  This brings huge poverty to families.  I find it particularly sad when kids suffer in such a situation.  Probably because of where they stood in society at one stage, there might not be much sympathy out there for them, but we always have to remember there are innocent parties here and those innocent parties have to be looked after.  Again, I acknowledge the St. Vincent de Paul and the carers in this regard.  They are very much to the fore.  However, we need to look at exceptional circumstances.  I am dealing with two cases at the moment.  Do not worry, Chairman, I will not mention names or say where they are.  One is in the south of the country and one is in the west of the country.  People have been suspended from work for minor issues, including from semi-State companies.  An investigation has been ongoing for a number of months.  They were getting a payment, an allowance, from the company, which has been cut off and now they have been asked to sign up for a jobseeker's payment.  The issue, however, is that if they do so, it will threaten their getting their job back in that company.  I know one case where people have gone almost four months without income and not knowing where to go.  Only in recent weeks that person, through a connection, came to me.  The person knows me and knows this person very well.  This poor individual has massive bills and is not able to pay anything at the moment.  The person has no income.  I have got on to the community welfare officer and I think something is going to happen.  In all this we must acknowledge in general that community welfare officers and the Department are exceptionally good in extremely sad cases.  I want to put that on the public record.  We need to put \"exceptional circumstances\" in the definition of poverty because there are people falling through the net and going through very hard times.  It is nobody's fault; it is just the way things fall.  Many of those people will never want to look for help.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on HAP payments.  I will not rehash the whole thing.  It definitely needs to be addressed and dealt with.  There is a lot of stress, particularly among lone parents.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right about that.<\/p> <p>  I also support Deputy Kerrane and others on the bin allowance.  Ms Duffy referred to this, and I pay tribute to her because I know she put in a lot of effort to get that situation sorted out, particularly for people with children or elderly people who need to use these pads.  I can tell the committee that the bills for these people's bins are still huge.  They have improved, but it is incredible that in 2021, in Ireland - and I know Ms Duffy sympathises with me on this - we cannot solve this issue.  It is incredible that the GDPR and other issues can cause this distress to people.  Here we have the political system and a decision made to give the money and we cannot give out the money.  These are not the people, by the way, who go down the laneways and byways and dump their material in the countryside.  Any of them I deal with pay their bills and they are getting it very hard.  We have to make an all-out effort to ensure what Deputy Naughten brought in when he was Minister is distributed to give these people a little relief.  If we do not, it is the system failing the most vulnerable, and surely none of us wants to be part of a system like that.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge the great work all the witnesses are doing.  So many people are looked after.  Discussing issues every year and &euro;5 for this and &euro;10 for that and a big Budget Statement is not the way to go forward in tackling poverty.  We need a new approach and new ideas.  If there is anything else the witnesses think I or my colleagues can lobby for on this, on these issues, I would be more than willing to do it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#K00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":493,"content":"<p>We will bring in the St. Vincent de Paul followed by Family Carers Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#K00400","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":494,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Murphy.  I fully agree we need to have a broad definition of what poverty means in Ireland.  As for the work in the community that SVP does, many of the people who request our help can often point to a single event that led to their current situation which has pushed them into poverty, whether it is the death of a family member, the birth of a child with additional needs, becoming unemployed unexpectedly or a family separation.<\/p><p>There are exceptional circumstances.  Every person is unique and has his or her own experience.  We really need to reflect that and the lived experience of people and how we talk and define poverty in national policy, as well as in the budgetary process.  That is really important.<\/p><p> I agree that we should be proud of the social protection system.  It does a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to poverty.  It does, unfortunately, leave people below the poverty line in many circumstances, and that is why we also need to ensure that we are investing in quality services that reduce the expenditure needs of households so that people have the supports and tools they need to get back into good circumstances and out of poverty and that we move people out of poverty for good.<\/p><p> It is vitally important that we talk more about the HAP payment because the fact that the top-ups are causing so much financial distress for households is often hidden.  We must acknowledge that the vast majority of homeless families are headed by someone parenting alone, usually a mother.  We must also acknowledge that the impact of family homelessness and the housing crisis is very gendered.<\/p><p> I fully agree that we need to start doing things differently when it comes to addressing poverty.  If we look to other countries like New Zealand, for example, it has amended its budgetary legislation to ensure that all decisions that are part of the budgetary process are assessed against their impact on poverty and inequality, ensuring that they are actively reducing it.  That is something that we would like to see incorporated into the budgetary process here.

I came in halfway through Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's contribution.<\/p> <p>  I thank the organisations for coming in this morning and giving their expert advice on what needs to be done to prevent poverty as much as possible or to help people to get out of the poverty trap.  The pandemic has very clearly exposed the underbelly of society and as a committee we have a big role to play in trying to deal with the issue.  I wish to raise two issues.<\/p> <p>  Recently, a young woman contacted me who is in receipt of a homeless HAP payment.  She came from homelessness.  She is on the &euro;990 homeless HAP limit.  The landlord recently wrote to her to say there will be a 4% increase on her rent.  That legislation was brought in by the Government to allow landlords to increase rent in rent pressure zones.  She says she cannot afford it and that she can see herself being homeless again.  She was told she can negotiate the top-up with her landlord or else go back to the normal HAP because the difficulty is that on the homeless HAP, one cannot transfer.  Have the witnesses come across similar situations?  When I spoke to people in the homeless HAP section, they said they are seeing it coming through, in particular people on the PUP are having difficulty paying the rent increases.  I was trying to figure out how we could deal with that.  I do not like to put money into landlords' pockets, but should we argue that if there is a 4% increase in rent, there should be a 4% increase on the HAP to counteract it?  I know that would impact on the 15% differential rent contribution the tenant has to pay but it would be less than the 4%.  I am trying to figure out in my own head how we should approach that because I think it might become more of an issue.  Obviously rent caps would be much better.<\/p> <p>  When the bin charge came in initially I was talking to a man who has a child with severe autism and he made the point that there should be a link between public health and the family because most people who are advised to get incontinence pads have a link with a GP or hospital and in that way we could get them signed up to have their bins collected.  A lot of these pads should be going for incineration rather than being mixed in with general waste.  He suggested that there should be a special collection of such waste.  That would probably stigmatise people because they would have to have a separate coloured bin, for example, but we have to find some way that we can get money to people with an extra burden such as incontinence pads.  I again thank the witnesses for coming.  I really appreciate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#L00300","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":498,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Joan Collins for raising the important issue regarding HAP.  This is something we see regularly.  The top-ups are causing great difficulty for households and the rent increases that are permitted are causing even more difficulty for them.  It is important to recognise that we must ensure adequate homeless prevention measures are in place because at the moment, we do not spend nearly enough on homeless prevention but the cost of providing emergency accommodation for a family can be upwards of &euro;35,000 every year.  If that could be prevented by adjusting the HAP payment or the limits, as a homeless prevention measure it would save the State a significant amount in the longer term.  There is a challenge between balancing the HAP limits with the potential impact on the private rented market in terms of inflating rents.  In our view, there is a need to review how HAP interacts with the private rented market.  We made a submission to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding that.  We compiled a detailed report with Threshold looking at HAP and how the limit on HAP impacts on low-income households.  A number of proposals were put forward in terms of how we can address those.  Rent certainty measures and rent caps need to be considered.  We have seen what has been possible in the past year in terms of rent protections for tenants.<\/p> <p>  Another issue that we are very concerned about is that we are getting calls from people who are in receipt of HAP and are in arrears on the top-up.  There is very little support for dealing with that, because if one falls behind on one's differential rent one could perhaps discuss it with the HAP section and renegotiate that but if one falls behind on the top-up, one is at risk of homelessness.<\/p> <p>  The protections that are in place for people impacted by Covid may not necessarily help these people.  We have seen households whose income has not changed, who are on social welfare, but their household expenditure on basics such as food and utilities has increased.  They are struggling even more to make those payments and they have fallen behind on their HAP top-up and now they could potentially be at risk of homelessness.  We are very concerned about this issue and that is why we ask that the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage would work closely and set up a budget line to ensure that we can prevent those households becoming homeless by providing additional supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Tricia Keilthy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":499,"content":"<p>I acknowledge the point Deputy Joan Collins made about the bins.

We have a person who sacrifices their life to care, often full time for someone in need of that care, and yet the system penalises them.  It is like saying to them that, by the way, their bin is going to cost more and if the disability services resume after Covid, they cannot provide the same transport service that was previously provided and the carer will have to provide it.

There was a scheme for which carers were ineligible, namely, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's  better energy warmer homes scheme.  Someone on a jobseeker's payment could apply and get a grant of 100% to do the installation in his or her house but a carer providing full-time care was not eligible.  Thankfully, the Chairman fixed that.  It is a great scheme.  The waiting list might be incredible but it was a great development.  Again, it was an example of how we recognise that carers should not be penalised for the contribution they make.<\/p><p> There is a similar anomaly in the system that I have been flagging for the past three years.  It does not relate directly to this committee but I am going to make my point anyway.  Under the tenant incremental purchase scheme whereby local authority tenants can purchase their homes if they can display that they can afford to do so, one of the only groups of social welfare recipients deemed ineligible comprises carers, or people in receipt of the carer's allowance.  A person on a one-parent family payment is eligible.  The only people said to be ineligible are those on carer's allowance.  I know of genuine carers who have cared for years, scrimped and saved, worked the 18.5 hours and want to buy their own home but they are told they are not eligible.  As a general rule, we have got to recognise the fact that we should not penalise carers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#L00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I have a couple of questions, one of which is for Family Carers Ireland.

Ms Petrie highlighted the issue regarding the social energy tariff and the possibility of considering an example here.  Any system that would ensure those in fuel poverty are not subsidising the cost of electricity for data centres and other big consumers of electricity in this country has to be examined.  It is immoral that people who are living in poverty are subsidising the cost of that electricity.  That cannot be allowed to continue.<\/p> <p>  Without giving us specific details, could Ms Duffy revert to us with the example of the carer with three profoundly disabled children who is ineligible for the carer's allowance?

When we think about energy poverty, we must think about the balance of contributing factors, including the earning of an inadequate income, the cost of energy for customers and the energy efficiency or quality of the housing.  I am not sure whether Dr. Keilthy can contribute on our building energy rating data and how they correlate with energy poverty figures.  Since so many householders are living in substandard accommodation and very energy-inefficient housing, they are already paying more.  There may be an inefficient heating system or uninsulated housing.  People in poverty and low incomes are paying higher bills with less income so they will be impacted by the energy inefficiency of their housing.  This is why we welcome the schemes in place for doing such important work in tackling that aspect of energy poverty, although, as has been mentioned, there are waiting lists and challenges with the capacity of the sector to meet the need that exists.<\/p> <p>  We would also like to highlight the challenges faced by people in the private rental sector who are living in energy-inefficient homes.  They suffer on foot of a split incentive and do not have the same agency to improve the quality of their housing.  Those in energy poverty in particular are paying more for their heating bills without having the ability to invest in their homes.  They have to rely on their landlord to make the decision.  We believe there is a gap in policy here that needs to be addressed so people in energy poverty in the private rental sector will not be left behind, resulting in a growing gap between those in energy-efficient homes and those in homes whose fabric or heating system has not been invested in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Issy Petrie"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I thank all the members of the committee for inviting us to speak today.

I hate answering a question by saying that we do not know but, unfortunately, we do not.  We have had this discussion with members of the Pensions Commission.  We do not know how many carers have fallen through the net.  Essentially, there are two groups of carers.  There is what we believe to be a very small number of carers, mainly women, who qualify for neither the contributory State pension, because they have not made enough contributions, nor the non-contributory State pension, because of the assets of their partner.  They get nothing and have fallen through the gap.  In addition, there are many more carers, again mostly female, who have been on a reduced pension by virtue of the fact that they have spent so long caring.  Therefore, there are two cohorts, one very small and the other much bigger.<\/p> <p>  The best way for us to secure a person's eventual pension entitlement is through work.  Most carers stay in work if they can.  We need to support them to do that.  This committee could examine the EU directive on work-life balance for parents and carers, which is due to be transposed into Irish law by August of next year.  It should consider some of the provisions of that directive.  It states that, at a minimum, carers should be entitled to five days' carer's leave per year.  That should be paid for; it should not be out of the carer's pocket.  Factors like these should be considered.  Let us support the carers to stay in work where they can and, where they cannot, support them through adequate social welfare provision, which I do not believe we are doing at the minute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2021050500002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Clare Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":506,"content":"<p>That is a good point to wrap up on.

This is the second of our public hearings to discuss the general scheme of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses.  They will all be joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams.  From the BAI, I welcome Mr. Michael O'Keeffe, chief executive, and Ms Celene Craig, deputy chief executive.  From the DPC, I welcome Ms Anne Morgan, deputy commissioner and head of legal, and her colleague, Ms Jennifer Dolan, assistant commissioner for children's policy.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the witnesses to make opening statements which will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  As they are probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statements on the website following the meeting.  I will call on each organisation to deliver their opening statements in the following order.  We will first hear from the BAI and then the DPC.  Opening statements are limited to five minutes per organisation.<\/p> <p>  I advise our guests of the following in the context of parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  As our witnesses today are attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, they should note that there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement whereby members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to the constitutional requirements.  Any member who attempts to attend from outside the precinct will be asked to leave the meeting.<\/p> <p>  I ask members to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report and also to please mute their microphones when not contributing in order to reduce background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the raise hand function when they wish to contribute.  I remind those joining today's meeting to ensure that their mobile phones are silent or switched off.<\/p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Keeffe to make an opening statement on behalf of the BAI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#A00400","speaker":"1601"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":514,"content":"<p>On behalf of the BAI, I thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us to present and answer questions today.  This is important legislation and we hope that our contribution will be of assistance to the committee in the important pre-legislative scrutiny work that they are doing currently and will continue to do over the next number of months.  I am joined by my colleague and deputy CEO of the BAI, Ms Craig.  We will both answer questions about the various topics that are raised in our submission.<\/p> <p>  I am sure that members are familiar with the BAI, which was established in 2009.  Our current responsibilities including licensing of commercial and community radio stations and television, regulation and the provision of support to independent and public service broadcast media.  We also provide funding for programming and archiving related to Irish culture, heritage and experience, through our sound and vision and archiving schemes.  Many people will be familiar with the sound and vision fund.<\/p> <p>  The BAI welcomes the Bill's provision for the functions and the staff of the organisation to be transferred to the new media commission when the legislation is enacted.  We believe that this approach will result in the BAI bringing its considerable knowledge and regulatory expertise gained to date, and also the planning work that we have done for the future regulation of on-demand and video-sharing platform services, to make a meaningful and early contribution to the work of the new media commission.<\/p> <p>  In the document containing our opening statement, of which, I know, members will all have received copies, I have outlined the current BAI activities which we believe are especially relevant to these new regulatory areas.  I am not going to go in to these in detail but we would be happy to answer questions on them.  The first area is the regulation of harmful content.  The second is the preparatory work undertaken by the BAI to support the transformation of the audiovisual media services directive, or the AVMSD, as people know it.  I have highlighted our work in the important areas of media literacy and also disinformation.  Members will be familiar with the term \"fake news\", as it is sometimes referred to.  We have done significant work on disinformation.  We have also been involved in the future funding and sectoral sustainability of public service, commercial and community broadcasters, and the independent productions sector.  We have engaged extensively with the Future of Media Commission, which is operating in parallel with this process.  We would be happy to take any questions that members may have on those aspects of our work.<\/p> <p>  The final part of the opening statement specifically addresses certain heads of the Bill.  I emphasise that the BAI welcomes and strongly supports the aims of the general scheme of the Bill.  It provides for the future regulation of traditional media and also online services.  We would commend our colleagues in the Department on the work they have put in to this over the past couple of years.  We especially value the establishment of a single content regulator.  That should ensure consistency in the approach to regulation.  We also welcome the emphasis on regulatory principles and policies which will serve and protect audiences and online users and which will also uphold and promote freedom of expression, cultural diversity and human dignity.  The high-level macro approach to regulation in managing the issue of scale is also welcomed.<\/p> <p>  Our submission refers to a small number of heads which we believe would benefit from further committee consideration.  We would be happy to take any questions that members have on these.  They include, in no particular order other than that in which we presented them in the document: the independence and resources and resources that will be available to the media commission; some of the categories and indeed definitions of harmful online content; the concept of compliance and warning notices, which we would be familiar with from our work; the proposed content levy and associated schemes that may emerge from that; and some elements of advertising limits.<\/p><p>We would be happy to elaborate on these positions regarding the heads, or any other matter that members may wish to question us on, during the question-and-answer session.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the general scheme and I look forward to answering whatever questions they may have about our submission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":516,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Keeffe.

While the Bill covers a number of areas, including broadcast media and on-demand audiovisual media services, the DPC's submission focuses primarily on Part 4, online safety, and the specific areas in which there may be potential synergies with the work of the DPC.<\/p> <p>  While the DPC is primarily concerned with its own area of regulation, namely, data protection, it recognises that the regulation of online safety issues, including harmful content, and data protection will naturally complement and be mutually supportive of each other.  The issue of children's data protection rights is a key priority for the DPC and an area in which we are working to raise standards of protection substantially.  As such, we are pleased to have this opportunity to bring a data protection perspective to this broader discussion on harmful content and online safety.  Although harmful content and online safety issues are outside the remit of data protection law, the DPC considers that these objectives are two sides of the same coin.<\/p> <p>  Digital technology is an intrinsic part of everyday life for each and every one of us and provides significant opportunities, but the online world also presents new risk scenarios for children and adults alike, many of which areas are not yet subject to oversight or regulation by an appropriate body.  Therefore, the DPC strongly welcomes the Government's decision to introduce separate legislation to regulate the area of harmful content, among other issues, and establish a dedicated, independent media commission, including a constituent member who will act as the online safety commissioner, to enforce the law.<\/p> <p>  As stated in our submission, the DPC notes that the Bill in its current form expressly excludes material that violates data protection or privacy law from falling within the scope of harmful content.  However, the DPC believes it is important that the media commission have the power to regulate all types of harmful online content irrespective of whether they involve personal data.  This is because there are clear limitations to the reach of data protection regulation, meaning it does not and cannot provide a comprehensive regime for tackling harmful content posted or shared in an online context.<\/p> <p>  In recent years, the DPC has experienced an increase in the number of complaints received relating to user-generated content that is considered offensive, harmful, defamatory or detrimental to the health, safety or well-being of one or more individuals.  In the absence of an existing statutory framework to regulate such issues and handle complaints in this area, the DPC finds itself having to deal with complaints relating to requests for the takedown of user-generated content despite the fact that the data protection regime is not intended to tackle such matters and does not provide an appropriate range of tools for dealing with them.  Issues around user-generated content also commonly overlap with the areas of content moderation and online safety, but the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018, which gives further effect to the GDPR, do not aim to regulate content.  Therefore, that legislation does not provide the tools nor the powers required to tackle such issues, including the power to issue immediate takedown notices on the basis of content alone.<\/p> <p>  Subject to limited exceptions, data protection law is generally not intended to regulate online interactions between individuals on a personal one-to-one basis, in other words, where there is no relationship between a data subject and a data controller.  As set out in further detail in the DPC's submission to the committee, there are a number of criteria that need to be met before data protection law is engaged in the context of a complaint.  For example, the content in question must contain personal data and the complaint must be raised by or on behalf of the data subject whose personal data are concerned.  However, even in cases where the content in question contains personal data and a complaint is submitted by or on behalf of the data subject, it is not always immediately apparent at the outset whether there has been an infringement of the GDPR.  The DPC must therefore embark on a course of action to handle and examine the complaint against the various obligations of data controllers under the GDPR.<\/p> <p>  It is important to highlight that the DPC cannot simply order the erasure or removal of personal data based on a unilateral assessment of online content.  This is because data protection law is not so much concerned with the nature of the content as it is with examining whether the rules in the GDPR and the 2018 Act have been complied with in the use of those personal data.  As such, the establishment of a dedicated body with the power to order, among other things, the swift takedown of all types of harmful content is imperative in this regard.<\/p> <p>  It is for these reasons that data protection regulation, which performs a substantially different policy function, is not the appropriate prism through which to tackle situations where the primary objective of a complainant is to ensure the immediate takedown of content due to its potential to cause real harm, whether physical, psychological or otherwise.  On the other hand, the Bill clearly and unequivocally aims to establish the jurisdiction of a new media commission for the purpose of regulating such matters, among others.<\/p> <p>  It is against this backdrop that the DPC respectfully suggests that the committee give consideration to the potential risks to the public interest of a regulatory lacuna arising following the Bill's enactment.  This potentially arises in circumstances where, as contemplated by the Bill, complaints about harmful content may be excluded from the remit of the media commission simply because the harmful online content in question also involves, at some level, the use of an individual's personal data.<\/p> <p>  We would be happy to discuss the finer points of the DPC's submission in detail and we welcome whatever questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":518,"content":"<p>I thank our witnesses for their opening statements.

I will use the short time I have to discuss the BAI and the establishment of the media commission, which I welcome.  A single content regulator is something that we can all get behind.  As I discussed with the departmental officials previously, it is widely accepted that the BAI will have to grow quickly and urgently into a media commission.  I have met a number of tech companies, some of which are concerned about the BAI's understanding of their industry.  There was some hope that the BAI would hire industry experts.  My primary interest is in online audiences and users being protected and served well by the new media commission.  That needs to happen as quickly as possible.  The Department has stated that it is preparing a business case and is engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Is the BAI optimistic about the recruitment process, which needs to happen before this legislation is passed?  What is the BAI's view on the need for urgency in establishing the commission?  Other than introducing this legislation, what can the Government and the BAI do to move this issue forward?<\/p> <p>  I will ask my remaining two questions while I have the floor.  One is about Irish women in terms of radio play.  Imelda May topped the album charts last month.  The last Irish woman to do so was Lisa Hannigan in 2016.  I commend the Why Not Her? campaign and Linda Coogan Byrne for their report and work on this issue.  The BAI mentioned the importance of the media commission in upholding cultural diversity.  Surely there should be more work done on tackling the disparity in air time.  Could we consider enforcing licensing conditions where women are disadvantaged compared to their male counterparts in terms of air time?<\/p> <p>  I will make my final point briefly.  It strikes me that the State has never realised or recognised the status and importance of community media.  I am not using that term interchangeably with \"local media\".  I am talking about community media as distinct from public service media and private commercial media.<\/p><p>How can the Future of Media Commission strengthen community media in Ireland in a new digital age?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#B00500","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I will take those questions.  I thank Senator Warfield.  The first question was on recruitment and urgency.  I am glad the Senator mentioned urgency because we absolutely agree with him on it.  I welcome the fact that this pre-legislative scrutiny is being done now.  There is a target to have it completed by the summer.  The target is also to have the legislation enacted by the end of the year.  That is very positive.  I urge the committee members, as legislators, to ensure this happens.  There is an imperative.  The audiovisual media services directive is in place since 2019 so I believe the end of 2021 is a target.  I agree strongly with the Senator on the urgency.<br\/><br\/>On the business case and recruitment, we have engaged with the Department.  I saw the proceedings of this committee's meeting with Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Shanley and Ms Triona Quill a couple of weeks ago.  We met them yesterday.  We have had preliminary discussions on the business case and what is involved in it.  Ms Quill, when she was here a couple of weeks ago, talked about a fairly exponential rise in the number of staff members.  We have about 40 people in the BAI.  Clearly, many more will be needed in the media commission.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a role and will be involved.  The Department will engage with the commission.  We have agreed, with the Department, to set up regular meetings.  We are talking about meeting every three to four weeks to update and plan.  There will be a need to start a recruitment process as early as is practicable.  How it will work out in practice will have to be negotiated through the Department of<b><\/b>Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a commitment on the Department's side and ours to work with those concerned.<br\/><br\/>The Senator made a point on the tech companies.  If the tech companies were happy with this, he might be more concerned.  In our submission, we set out all the activities in this area in which we have been engaged, including through the European Commission and the European regulatory group that we chaired.  We have chaired several groups involved in this so our knowledge in this area is very strong.  We have engaged with the tech companies and look forward to continuing to do so.  We agree with the Senator on the concept of urgency and its importance in making progress.<br\/><br\/>Let me address the Senator's other two questions.  On the question on women, we are meeting Ms Coogan Byrne.  The gender team, which involves my colleagues Ms Stephanie Comey and Ms Deborah Molloy Bergin, has set up a meeting with Ms Coogan Byrne, to be held next week on 14 May.  The team has had positive engagement with her in the recent past.  There is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed.  We have a good track record on this.  We had a similar situation regarding women in creative roles in the independent production sector.  We introduced criteria for the sound and vision fund.  That has seen a fairly significant rise in writers and directors, although maybe less so with respect to directors of photography.  This is another of the areas we have examined.  The rise is a result of policies we introduced with the scheme.  There is no question but that there is an issue that needs to be addressed.  It has not been raised with us in the past.  It was raised by Ms Coogan Byrne last autumn for the first time.  We have been engaging.  There is a need to engage with the commercial radio sector and, indeed, the public broadcaster, including its radio section.  We intend to come up with some proposals and move on this.

Mr. O'Keeffe spoke extensively in his opening statement about tackling disinformation and fake news.  This is very apt given the day that is in it.  The Facebook oversight board is set to rule today on whether Mr. Donald Trump's ban for using the Facebook platform to incite an insurrection should stand.  My point applies to all social media platforms.  The world will watch with interest.  This development follows on from a weekend over which major sports organisations across the United Kingdom effected a total online media blackout to combat online hate speech and online racism.  It is an interesting time to be discussing all these issues.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. O'Keeffe, whom I praise for his work in this area, said it may not be appropriate, given the scale of the regulations and the fact that the general scheme is already very significant, to include broader societal harm at this juncture.  Could he elaborate on that point?  Furthermore, could he elaborate on the definitions related to harmful online content?  He said he is concerned with the element of the definition concerning what a reasonable person would conclude is the intention of the dissemination. Could he expand on that?<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the content levy, Mr. O'Keeffe, in keeping with considerations on resources and so forth, noted that consideration should be given to the removal or prohibition of funding for news and current affairs content, given emerging concerns in respect of disinformation.

The BAI and the European Commission have been doing a huge amount of work on disinformation with the voluntary code of practice.  We released two pieces of research in the last couple of years, ElectCheck and CodeCheck, on how the platforms were fulfilling the requirements of the code.  The results were not great to be honest, and it raises the question of whether there is a need for greater intervention from a regulatory perspective.  We continue to do more work in that area.<\/p> <p>  The reason we suggested waiting is that we believe there will be further legislative developments at European level that will need to be taken into account.  To go back to my earlier point about urgency, our feeling was that while it would be premature on one level, on another level, because it is so complex, this legislation needs to go through.  It would make more sense to await the current legislative developments.  We are not dismissing the concerns and issues around that.<\/p> <p>  On the content levy, we have been clear on our rationale.  The original exclusion of new and current affairs was for a particular reason.  For media plurality, and returning to the Senator's point on disinformation, we believe there should not be a restriction on news and current affairs in schemes.<\/p> <p>  The European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, ERGA, has done significant work on the preparation of schemes of this nature as they are being introduced in a range of jurisdictions.  We are involved in a group that is involved in that process and will continue to support that work.<\/p> <p>  If one is taking a percentage of a levy from broadcasters and, indeed, new media, I am not sure one can restrict a scheme to applications from organisations that are supported by the sector.  In the history of schemes of this nature, for example, the Sound and Vision scheme on the television side, 95% of funding goes to independent producers who have the support of broadcasters.  It is inevitable that a scheme of this nature will provide great support to the independent production sector when it is introduced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The BAI supports the categories of online harm that have been included within the general scheme.  We consider that these constitute some of the most egregious harms.  We support the idea that online users should be protected from such harms while they are using online services.  We have a small concern.  In general, we believe the definitions need to be readily usable in practice.  In the first instance, that will involve definitions that can be readily applied by the online platforms, which can decide if material is in breach of the statute.  It is very important that they are usable, including at scale given the number of complaints and concerns that may be expressed and brought to any one platform.<\/p> <p>  We have concerns around the requirement to conclude intent.  We see there may be some practical difficulties with this, particularly where all of the context may not be known.  We are also keen to state that the real intention is not necessarily to assign blame to the person who may have caused the harm but, rather, to insure that a user is protected from harm, particularly a child.  In a case where a child is being cyberbullied by another child or other children, it may be difficult to conclude there was intention.  Nevertheless, the definitions as they are applied should be capable of determining that this has the potential to cause harm and, therefore, merits consideration or removal in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":527,"content":"<p>The Senator raised the issue of user-generated content and complaints about it that land on our desk.  He also asked about the types of complaints, the age profile of complainants and the volume of complaints of this nature.  We currently have around 80 user-generated complaints.  I understand none of these relates to minors or those under 18 years.  In general, the nature of the complaints is that a person has had a post placed on a platform that relates to him or her and the complainant is unhappy about it, finds it offensive or threatening or may consider it defamatory.  The difficulty for complainants is that because they are objecting to the nature of the content in question rather than asserting that there has been some sort of infringement insofar as the rules around data protection are concerned, when we go about evaluating that complaint, we must do so within the framework of the data protection regime.  That means, first, trying to establish whether there is a control, process or relationship in being, because that is the cornerstone of the application of GDPR and the 2018 Act.  We must also look at whether there is a lawful basis for the processing of those data.<\/p> <p>  Complications will generally arise when we put the complain to the platform.  It will often tell us that it does not believe there has been an infringement of personal data.  Platforms are generally only prepared to remove that sort of content when there has been an infringement of their community standards or terms of use.  That process of going back and forth between the complainant and platform must necessarily be an iterative one.  As we said in our written submissions to the committee and opening statement, we do not have the power to order the immediate takedown of content on the basis of the content alone.  Instead, we must embark on a process of tracing through the various rules in the GDPR.<\/p> <p>  It is a complicated process that frequently does not yield an outcome with which the complainant is satisfied.

I will deal first with the issue of gender-based violence.  The point we would like to make in this regard is again in reference to the categories of online harm specified in the general scheme, categories which we support.  Under head 49A, category (b), \"material which is likely to have the effect of intimidating, threatening, humiliating or persecuting a person to which it pertains and which a reasonable person would conclude was the intention of its dissemination\" is specified as a category of harmful online content.  While one might consider that gender-based violence or harm caused online to be included within that definition, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is very concerned about the specific targeting of women online, in particular, although not solely, those in public office, women politicians and women journalists.  There has been significant targeting of such people, which we believe has the potential to cause real harm.  The BAI believes that there might be some benefit in giving a level of specificity in this regard within the Bill.  An alternative might be to require the media commission to specify within an online code that gender-based violence, or any kind of sexuality-based violence such as homophobic content, is to be considered as forming part of that particular category of online harm.  That is where we are coming from on that issue.<\/p> <p>  With regard to advertising limits, the BAI's position on advertising limits has for some time been that there is a value in the media regulator having oversight of all of the advertising limits rather than having a broken-up system in which there is some role for different parties such as the Minister and the media commission.  It allows for differentiation in the allocation of minutage and a singular policy approach across different forms of media, having regard to different factors that impact different media.  That is our main purpose in making that recommendation.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also talked about the steps the media commission would take.

This role may be in the expansion of the categories of online harm or in the oversight or acknowledgement of any online codes that might apply.

Our licence agreements or contracts with broadcasters spell out the manner in which they will deliver on diversity objectives but there are many other ways in which the BAI supports diversity.  For example, we do so very extensively through the sound and vision scheme.

This has the potential to be one of the most powerful regulators in the State.  I received assurances from Department officials that there would be codes around algorithmic decision-making and guarding against bias and potential harm in this regard.  It was suggested that this would be managed by the media commission.  Will biometric authentication and the use of biometrics now fall within the remit of the DPC or that of the media commission?  When we are looking at various new forms of artificial intelligence, AI, and how they are going to be rolled out, particularly by some of the tech companies, I would like to know where these matters will fall between the organisations.  The BAI may wish to comment on this as well.  When we spoke with officials from the Department, they envisaged the BAI being folded into the new media commission.  This commission will, however, cover a far broader range of issues.  The Department envisaged that the commission would be at least the size of the DPC.

A compliance and enforcement regime is to be introduced by the media commission for services falling within the scope of legislation.  An important part of that is not just looking at content that is on the platform that should have been taken down but also ensuring, in the interests of freedom of expression, that regulation is not having an over-chilling effect.  It will also be important for the media commission to have auditing powers to examine that type of content.

Are there ways to address that so that we can deal with all forms?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#F01400","speaker":"1639","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":554,"content":"<p>I will answer the Senator's first two questions.  The BAI waived the industry levy for commercial and community radio stations during the first half of 2020 in view of the extremely adverse financial circumstances in which the sector found itself arising from the Covid pandemic.  The Minister had asked us to consider that request, which we did.  There are no immediate plans to waive the levy further.  However, the BAI has been busy, both last year and continuing into the current year, in disbursing funds that the Minister has made available in addition to the normal funds that would accrue to the sound and vision scheme.  The sound and vision rounds of programme funding are being made available across the various sectors of the broadcasting industry.  That additional financial benefit is accruing in recognition of their contributions to the provision of content as it links to the pandemic both last year and as it is unfolding, and the issues that are arising in the current year.<\/p> <p>  We have flagged disinformation as an area of major concern for the BAI, as a regulator, and also for our European colleagues.  We felt it was important to raise this with the committee.  We also suggested that some time might be taken before this would be considered for inclusion in legislation.  The scope of obligations and functions that will fall to the new media commission is very wide.  It might be best to let the commission get on with regulating in the space of personal harms as they are articulated in the Bill.  Nonetheless, we believe this is an ongoing issue.<\/p> <p>  The second possible reason to defer consideration of inclusion in the legislation at this point is that there is potential at European level for the introduction of new legislation to address disinformation.  This would allow Ireland then to co-ordinate with the European legislation in addressing it.  The BAI is certainly satisfied to continue with its work in this space.  We also believe that the media commission should stay actively involved in tracking developments in this area, particularly as they may have implications within Ireland.  The commission should also have a wider sense of what is happening at the European level and beyond.  The new regulator should certainly stay in that space, albeit there might be some value in postponing the inclusion of it within the legislation pending clarification of potential developments at the European level.  It is very actively under discussion and we would expect it to become clear later this year or at the very latest early next year.<\/p> <p>  I know the Senator addressed this question to the DPC.  However, I might just address the concern that certain categories of online harm might be excluded.  This area might benefit from clarification with the departmental officials.  Our reading of the general scheme was not that categories of online harm would be excluded by virtue of the fact that they might contain some personal data, but rather that it was more to protect the functions of the Data Protection Commissioner and make those clear and distinct from the functions of the media commission.  Therefore, determinations in respect of data protection would not be made by the media commission but rather they would be made by the Data Protection Commissioner and the powers of the media commission would be confined to issues as they concern online harm.<\/p> <p>  We realise that this is complex and that complaints may be made that will have a data protection element as well as involving an online harm element.  The BAI very much supports this - indeed we proposed the approach within the Bill.  We very much endorse the idea that the media commission could enter into structured co-operation agreements with other regulators.  We would certainly foresee, particularly in the area of protection of minors, that there will be a need for very structured engagement between the media commission and the office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  The BAI would certainly welcome early engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner in this regard.  We believe that because of some of these complexities, a co-operation agreement that would allow us to clarify some of these issues would be very desirable and in the interests of both organisations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":555,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his questions and I also thank Ms Craig for her comments on these issues.  If someone has posted content online about another individual, issues may arise concerning both harmful online content concerns and data protection concerns.  It can be hard for individuals to differentiate between the two different areas of regulation.  While we appreciate that it may not have been the intention to have an outright exclusion of material which conflicts with or violates data protection law from the remit of the media commission, because of the very explicit way in which head 49(A) has been drafted, we are concerned that the impact could be to exclude complaints which are primarily about the nature of the content and the potential for harmful effects on one or more individuals.  Those sorts of complaints might fall entirely outside the remit.<\/p> <p>  Ms Craig has referred to the possibility of co-operation agreements and I note that that is dealt with in head 29 of the general scheme.  I wish to comment on that part of the general scheme.  It is not entirely clear that there would necessarily be a handoff of complaints between the media commission and the DPC or any other regulator.  If that was to be the case, the DPC has made the point in its written submission that insofar as there might be a transmission of complaints between regulators, there would need to be a clear legal basis for the transfer of those complaints given that they would involve personal data.  We consider that Article 6.1(a) of the GDPR and the legal basis for how performance of a task in the public interest is engaged it would require a basis in Irish law in order for those complaints to be transferred.<\/p> <p>  Equally, we note Ms Craig's comments and the intention to have general co-operation agreements.  We think it is a good idea to have arrangements in place between regulators outlining the processes by which they would interact with each other.  If there was an intention to transfer individual complaints containing personal data, that would require specific legislation and the creation of a legal basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Anna Morgan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Munster.

We held preliminary discussions with the Department, which is making a business case to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Obviously, it is a new area.  We are part of that working group and it is envisaged the new media commission will set the scheme.  It is a different scheme but similar in concept to the broadcasting funding scheme, which we established in 2005.  The principles are the same but the media commission will need to decide on certain aspects such as the percentage of the levy, what is involved, who is liable to pay the levy and who is eligible, and how the funding will be allocated with regard to types of programming and content.  There is a range of questions we will need to address in preparing the new scheme.

The BAI envisages a very high-level scheme where, primarily, the platforms themselves will be required, through the commission's codes, to take responsibility for the matters and content that link to areas specified in the legislation.  We expect the online platforms would have in place the necessary arrangements to deal speedily with issues that are raised and with content that might be prohibited by the codes.<\/p> <p>  There is one area we do not envisage the media commission should be involved, namely, the large-scale removal of content on online platforms.  We do believe, however, that ultimately the media commission should have the ability to make a determination in respect of a piece of content that is particularly egregious, where the commission is of the view that the matter has not been resolved to satisfaction.  It is important to say that the general scheme envisages that the platforms will take responsibility, that there will be independent appeals mechanisms and that there will be potential for mediation.  We do not envisage a vast number of such requests landing on the media commission's desk, but there would be some situations.  We are quite persuaded around this, having spoken with many of the organisations who are involved in dealing with harmful online content, and especially harmful online content as it impacts young children and where the need is to protect the individual or a vulnerable adult from the harm being caused.  We believe that ultimately this should be an option open to the new media commission.  The BAI does not envisage - I must strongly say - that there will be a large or wholesale taking down of content in a way that may not be desirable.  Ultimately, we are hoping that platforms are encouraged to adhere to the code, to make the right decisions and to have in place the proper processes for the removal of harmful content.  We recognise that there is a big concern that not all complaints of this nature can be successfully resolved.  There is a particular concern as it impacts young children who are active on platforms.  That is the BAI's thinking in that regard.  We suggest that it be given some further consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#H00400","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":561,"content":"<p>I apologise for the technical issues earlier.

The first question is to the BAI and concerns the impact on local commercial radio of the setting up of the new media commission.  I apologise if this question has been asked already.  Do the witnesses have an opinion on what this will mean for local commercial radio?  It is a really tough world out there for them to compete.  Advertising revenue has gone online to a great extent.  Without a shadow of a doubt the local stations provide an important media service and this does not get enough recognition.

This may have been covered already.  Will there be enough emphasis on fake news for example?  I believe this area has really been exacerbated and highlighted during the pandemic and even in recent months with the roll-out of the vaccine.  Some people who have quite an influential social media presence with a large reach and a big following have been purporting and extolling incorrect information.  This is damaging to public health.<\/p><p>Do the witnesses believe that, as presented, the scope of the Bill's heads is wide enough to cover this issue?<\/p><p> Much of what I am about to raise next has been addressed, but I have to speak about a young woman who bravely told her story recently about a fake Instagram account that had been set up in her name and using her face and that showed sexually explicit images of other young women.  She received horrific abuse.  It was a shocking experience that only occurred in the past couple of weeks.  It highlighted that this has happened to many young women throughout Ireland.  It is horrific.  The act is illegal under Coco's Law, but it is still happening.

It is our bread and butter.  We started off as the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC, way back when.  I am unsure whether the Deputy is aware of it, but we have run a number of schemes in the past 12 months reflecting the difficulties that the sector has encountered.  There was a levy waiver from the BAI during the first half of last year.  We have run two special sound and vision schemes with the support of the Minister, who has given us additional funding to allow that.  The schemes have been appreciated by the sector.  We have a good relationship with the sector on a number of fronts through the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, which I believe will appear before the committee soon, and Learning Waves Skillnet, which is the training and development group.  The latter's AGM was last Friday.  It is a successful and strong group and we provide funding supports to it.

The first comment to make about the scope of the online safety and media regulation, OSMR, Bill is that there is considerable breadth in the matters it covers.  There are all of the matters covered by the audiovisual media services directive as well as the individual harms envisaged within the national scheme.<\/p> <p>  Disinformation, or fake news as it is often called, is a major concern and an important area of activity for the BAI currently.  However, it is not envisaged by the OSMR Bill's provisions as drafted.  We raised this matter for the Oireachtas's consideration.  We are aware of the potential for damage that can arise in respect of some of the public health matters to which the Deputy referred.  However, we have suggested in our submission that this is something that the Oireachtas might put a pause to.  While there is good reason for including it within the scope of the Bill, it is fair to say that what the Bill covers is already extensive and it is important that the media commission address those issues and get measures up and running quickly.<\/p> <p>  Another reason for deferring this matter for the present time, albeit keeping it in consideration for down the line, is the potential for legislation at European level in this regard.  The matter is being actively considered by regulators and legislators at European level.  We believe that there may be some developments there.  As such, there could be some value in waiting to see what those developments are, thereby allowing Ireland to co-ordinate on the issue.  While the media commission should support activities at European level, particularly in terms of identifying issues concerning Covid vaccines and so forth, a media regulator can try to determine what impact such issues will have at an Irish level, which is what the BAI is currently trying to do.  We intend to continue our work in this vein.  We also suggest that the media commission maintain an informational and research role in this regard.  In terms of bringing it within the scope of the legislation, there may be some value in waiting to see what happens at European level.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy spoke about the case of a young woman whose personal data were used in a shocking experience.  As he rightly stated, it was considered illegal under Coco's Law.

I am also familiar with the story of the young woman - many of us may be - about whom Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan spoke.  When we set up an online safety commissioner, we want to be able to assure that woman that this State regulator will be able to deal with the situation she faced and address such concerns.  It is key that the office of the online safety commissioner have teeth.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Keeffe made a point about the speed of setting up this legislation.  I agree that we need to get the media commission established.  The BAI has extensive experience of regulating broadcasting, but regulating tech companies and social media and dealing with online abuse and harm is a new and growing area.<\/p><p>We were talking earlier about biometrics and algorithms, and I am conscious of what the witnesses said earlier about this.  I think a flood of queries will arrive in to the new online safety commissioner.  Ms Morgan might be able to comment on this.  Every year the Data Protection Commission gets something like 6,000 individual queries around data protection breaches.  If we look at the scale and level of online abuse that is out there, I have no doubt that if we have an online safety commissioner, that will attract thousands upon thousands of queries and complaints.<br\/><br\/>Ms Craig spoke earlier about the abuse that female journalists have been experiencing online.  Journalists and politicians have experienced a lot of online abuse, and we heard this talked about on radio recently.  There is going to be a role for this new commission and the online safety commissioner in reassuring those in journalism and politics that while people can engage in robust debate, when it crosses the line into abuse and harassment, the online safety commissioner will be able to deal with that.  For example, it will need to be strong enough to be able to deal with the story of that young woman Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan spoke about and of many others.  We have to ensure that role is strong enough.<br\/><br\/>This comes back to the crucial question of the extent to which we allow the social media companies to self-regulate, and this is where I would be grateful for the views of the witnesses.  At the moment, if anyone makes a complaint about online abuse to Twitter or Facebook, it can take a long time to be addressed and it is often addressed <i>ex post facto<\/i>.  While some of this is around education and so on, we need to look at ways to address this beforehand.  Whether that is done by stopping anonymous accounts through people having to register with an intermediary or by having to identify themselves in the same way as if they were setting up a bank account, those issues have to be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I am concerned.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views on whether the current system, where the tech companies are essentially self-regulating, should be allowed to continue.  It comes back to the question from Senator Cassells around the Donald Trump question.  Regardless of anyone's views on Donald Trump, this is a social media company making a critical decision around the future of democracy.  It could be me or anyone else tomorrow.  Yes, there is a point about getting the media commission set up and running, and dealing with the audiovisual media services directive and the regulation of that sector.  However, from listening to all of the questions, the debate has been around the online safety commissioner.  The Data Protection Commission is right that it has to try to cover all forms of online harm, and this is why I was asking about the level of staffing required.  If we look at the number of content moderators, even somewhere like Facebook, that gives an idea of the scale of the challenge.<br\/><br\/>I am unloading a lot there.

The reason the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is involved is that we are a body that has been involved in regulating harmful content for many years.  We are a principles-based regulator and it is around principles.  The principles are very similar as they are around hate speech, protection of minors and advertising, although that is slightly different.  Those principles form the basis of our regulation.  This is starting something from scratch.  There has never been an online safety commission in this jurisdiction and the question is who we get involved in it.  I think we should get people or a body that has experience, perhaps not absolutely in this area, but in areas that are similar.  Other jurisdictions are looking at this.  The UK is giving responsibility to OFCOM in this area.  Australia, which is the first example I am aware of, appointed a separate online safety commissioner, but associated or attached to the Australian media regulator.

The scale of what is envisaged by the general scheme cannot be underestimated but, at the same time, it is breaking important new ground.  A lot of concern has been expressed, understandably and justifiably, about the fact platforms are regulating themselves at the moment.  The first point to make is that what this scheme envisages is that this era of self-regulation, insofar as the matters within the scope of the scheme are concerned, is over.  The Minister would previously have made those comments when the scheme was introduced back in 2019, and that is important.  What we are seeing now is a requirement for platforms to be accountable to an independent regulator for their activities as they are spelled out in the legislation.  That is the first point.<\/p> <p>  The issue that has to be addressed, and this is the real challenge in moving from a broadcasting model of regulation to one which is overseeing online platforms, is that the scale of content we are dealing with is altogether of a different nature.  This was central to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's thinking when it came to making its own proposals to Government in regard to the form that the regulation should take.  What we want is an independent regulator that can ultimately take a view in regard to compliance or otherwise by a platform with the requirements of the legislation.  However, it does not mean that a new regulator will be able to manage all of the complaints, and that is not what is envisaged by the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The real difference between the current regulatory regime and the future regulatory regime will be a reliance, to a large extent, on the platforms to actually take on board the requirements of the legislation and to ensure they implement those as fully and as carefully as they can.  However, where another level of oversight comes in is in regard to the role of the media commission, which will take a view and set the basis upon which the online platforms are expected to behave, and through its online codes will be very clear about the matters with which the online platforms are obliged to comply.  That might be not just in regard to the content but it might concern their policies, procedures and practices.<\/p> <p>  One of the procedures we would expect an online platform to make very clear is what are its own internal procedures for ensuring that such content is not present on its platform.  That might include some element of machine learning, and we referred earlier to algorithmic activity.  It will no doubt involve a certain level of internal human content moderation that might potentially have a number of stages and, indeed, even an appeal stage within the platform itself.<\/p> <p>  There is also potential, we believe, for independent bodies to perhaps participate in an independent dispute resolution mechanism.  That is required, for example, under the audiovisual media services directive and we would certainly recommend that the regulator has a role in either overseeing or ensuring that those independent dispute resolution mechanisms are established and operate and function well.  There is also provision in the statute for potential mediation.<\/p><p>We see that where the most egregious complaints are concerned or there are systemic problems with certain forms of content on the platform.  Those can be taken directly to the media commission and the commission would be in a position to make determinations in respect of some of those matters.  However, we have to be realistic.  It is not envisaged that a media commission would deal with what could - on a Europe-wide basis in relation to, for example, the hate speech provisions of the directive - amount to thousands of complaints daily.  That will not be practical or workable.<\/p><p> It will be important for the media commission to get the messaging right around what its role and function is.  An important part of that is that, for the first time, video-sharing platforms and online platforms generally will be accountable to an independent regulator, who will be able to shine a light on their practices and performance in complying with the legislation.  The day-to-day management of complaints will be a matter for the platforms, albeit the regulator will be able to take a view as to the adequacy of the systems and procedures they put in place and could make a determination where they need to move and the actions they are required to take to comply with the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2021050500002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Celene Craig","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I ask for the DPC's experience because part of it will be around these independent complaints.

We respectfully suggest the committee consider seeking further expert input on this area.  There is a delicate balance and we understand the unique challenges that can arise from a large volume of complaints and the obligation to handle same.

It is really around the good design of a proper performance, compliance and enforcement regime for all of the platforms that are designated for regulation under the general scheme.

As regards the general enforcement structure contemplated by the general scheme of the Bill, a very different regulatory framework applies to the DPC.  Obviously, the tasks and powers of the DPC emanate from EU law and the GDPR.  There is an obligation on supervisory authorities under Article 77 of the GDPR to handle every complaint and to investigate each complaint to the extent appropriate.  There is an obligation on the DPC under section 109 of the 2018 Act, which gives further effect in Ireland to those regulatory obligations, to seek to amicably resolve complaints in the first instance.

Flowing from non-compliance with a warning notice, there is the possibility for criminal sanctions as well as various applications that can be made to the court.

I read the report and I am very encouraged by its findings and recommendations.  If we look to other jurisdictions, we see that Ireland is behind the curve.  I strongly believe we need to embrace this as a way to reopen our economy and society and to keep it open.  That is the main point.  If we look across to the UK, we can see that households there can apply for two test kits a week and millions of these test kits have been brought into the UK.  We need to do the same in Ireland.  Professor Ferguson has recommended that we move at pace on this.  I strongly endorse that recommendation and call on the Government to do just that, and to make arrangements to put these recommendations into place.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, there is movement in terms of rolling out pilots here and the Minister, Deputy Harris, has moved on this in the higher education sector.  I see a real opportunity for Shannon Airport as a distribution and logistical hub for the delivery of test kits and their distribution across the country.  The UK used Bournemouth Airport to do that and I think Shannon is very well placed to play a leading role in the distribution of these kits.<\/p> <p>  What is the difference between antigen testing and LAMP testing?  I see there are differences between them in the report so Professor Ferguson might explain that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#A00500","speaker":"1517"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I will do my best to explain the differences.  A rapid antigen test detects a protein on the virus and it works where, in the test kit, there is an antibody that binds to that protein, and that is then linked to some sort of marker, whether it is a fluorescent marker or a gold marker, and it reads out as a little line.  In simple terms, it is a lateral flow antigen test and it is predominantly detecting the presence of live virus of proteins that are in the intact virus.  That is the basis of most pregnancy tests so, for many years, people have been able to walk into a chemist shop and buy a pregnancy test, which is a lateral flow test that works in that way.<\/p><p>What is great about this is it does not require a laboratory or any special equipment.  It is a kit which anybody can use on their own or under supervision.  By contrast, LAMP testing requires a laboratory, but unlike PCR, it does not require very sophisticated equipment or chemicals.  It only requires an oven.  For LAMP testing, one mixes the reagents and then tests the sample and it reads out, but this has to be done in a laboratory.  It is slightly more accurate than a lateral flow antigen test and it might be suitable, for example, for a large company with, say, 2,000 employees or for those with access to a basic laboratory facility.  LAMP testing is being used in some of the universities, such as Trinity College Dublin, for testing students.  It is faster than PCR and slightly more accurate than lateral flow antigen testing, but in simple terms, it requires a dedicated person and a laboratory.  <\/p><p> Our report focuses on the lateral flow antigen testing because ultimately, as rightly stated by the Deputy, people can do the test themselves.  People can be trained to do it at home and, where a test is positive, the person would not go to work, but would have a confirmatory PCR test from the HSE.  That is very much the strategy that the UK and other countries such as Austria, are pursuing.  In the United States, there are big programmes under way as well and other countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and so on are empowering their citizens to take ownership of their health and test themselves and, if they test positive, to go for a confirmatory PCR test.  These tests are not quite as accurate as PCR.  The false positive rate is approximately 1 in 1,000, which means that from every 1,000 tests carried out there will be a positive that is actually a negative.  The order of accuracy in regard to the negative results, in other words where the test reads negative but a person is actually positive, is between 50% to 80%.<\/p><p> A really important point made in the report is that validated tests only should be used, a list of which are available on the EU Joint Research Centre website.  Those are tests that have been validated by at least one member state and in use by at least more two member states and they meet certain minimum specificities.  There are certain commercial tests that do not work nearly as well as I have articulated.  They should not be used.  People should use only those tests on the validated list.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Ferguson.

It would appear that the technology might be moving but policy and Government response is static.  I would welcome Professor Ferguson's opinion on the delay in moving on antigen testing and if he believes now is the time to act and to do so immediately.

Does Professor Ferguson believe there is need for a pre-departure antigen test and post-arrival serial antigen testing that might meet the same quality standard?

The answer is &quot;Yes, we should act immediately.&quot;  In regard to the Deputy's other question, in the United Kingdom the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, group produced a paper, which is available on the <i>gov.uk <\/i>website at SAGE<i><\/i>minutes, in which it modelled the effects of serial testing of travellers coming into the country and showed that that was as effective as quarantine.  What does this mean?  It means that when a traveller comes into a country, he or she is issued with a barcoded rapid antigen test.  The barcoding is unique and there will be a record of to whom, say, ten tests are given.  Those individuals test themselves daily, take a photograph of the barcode and the test result and then upload it to an IT system, which records that a person has done a test and it is negative.  That person can then go about his or her business.  If a person does not turn in a test - a person might forget to do it or deliberately not do it - he or she is issued with an automated reminder to do it.  If the person repeatedly does not do the test, as the IT system has recorded when that person entered the country, as well as his or her telephone number, contact details and so on, somebody will pay him or her a visit to find out what is going on.  That was modelled for SAGE and shown to be as effective in isolating infectious individuals as quarantine, either at home or in a hotel situation.  It is my understanding that the UK is now piloting that at present.<br\/><br\/>Our recommendation was about essential workers coming into the country.  These would be people coming in to fix a piece of equipment, to carry out a specific operation on a patient or to treat somebody.  It would also include people coming here to attend a funeral.  These are all situations in which it would difficult to quarantine people because they have to act immediately.  We are suggesting that in those situations, serial rapid testing could be used but tests would need to be barcoded and an IT system is required as well.  This could then used in the longer term.  This is contained in the body of the report, not the recommendations.  In the longer term, when more people are vaccinated in, maybe, a few months' time, this might be something for a number of people coming into the country.  Consideration could be given to giving it to everybody on an aeroplane.  The most important thing to remember is that numbers become important.  If most people do it, we are far better off than having a small number of people doing something else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Ferguson.

Based on Professor Ferguson's experience and understanding of antigen testing, does he see a role for it in the hotel environment?  Could it form part of a building of confidence in people to visit hotels and participate in activities that happen in that environment?

In answer to his question, yes, I do believe rapid testing will be very important in instilling confidence in people who may wish to go to hotels, restaurants and so on.  It may very well be the case that the owners of hotels or restaurants will do this voluntarily.  Speaking personally, I would feel a lot more confident about going to a hotel or restaurant if I knew that everyone there had been rapidly tested or tested previously.  It is not perfect.  There will be some mistakes but it is an awful lot better than doing nothing.  It is important in restoring confidence.  I am not sure I would make it mandatory but there is a role there for business owners.<\/p> <p>  In terms of mandatory hotel quarantine, this situation will become really interesting as travel begins to open up.  It is really important that we do these pilots soon and quickly.  The report talked about moving at pace.  If we start with the essential workers, we can find out what compliance is like, what the IT systems are like and how easy it is to do.  We would then be in a very good position to think about whether this could be rolled out more widely and whether we could potentially dispense with mandatory quarantine, as the Senator mentioned.  Variants are going to become very important.  They come from other countries but also develop in our own country.  They generate spontaneously.  Therefore, widespread testing both of visitors and the indigenous population is important to keep a handle on those variants.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":605,"content":"<p>How confident is Professor Ferguson that the existing tests will be sensitive to the variants?

The reason for this is that the antibodies are detected at what is called the nucleocapsid of the virus.  This is the bit that does not change much.  The good news is that the test will tell one whether the virus is present, but it will not tell one if it is a variant.  The strategy would be for those who tested positive on an antigen test to take a confirmatory PCR test, from which the virus would be sequenced, allowing us to know what variant, if any, was present.  The trick behind the testing is twofold.  First, it will allow an awful lot of people to be screened very quickly and cheaply.  Second, it will allow those who test positive to be isolated very quickly.  That is the most important thing if this system is to substitute for hotel quarantine.  One gets the result within approximately 30 minutes.  People who test positive should isolate until they get a confirmatory PCR, after which they may need to continue to isolate.  Rapid isolation is the trick.  That will allow this system to be substituted for quarantine.  Of course, compliance will be important.  That is why I really believe that we need to do these pilots at scale so we can get the data, see what they look like and see if this could be deployed more widely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":607,"content":"<p>I will ask a final question if I may.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#C00500","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":608,"content":"<p>We have to move on.

What I have described would be a pretty good sign that such a person was relatively safe.  What do I mean by that?  The antigen test determines whether one is infectious and may pass on the virus.  One is much less likely to pass on the virus if one is vaccinated.  If one is in the category of those who may pass on the virus despite being vaccinated, which is rare, that should be picked up with an antigen test.  When those two things are combined, it is fairly safe to say that most infectious people would be caught and that it would be a satisfactory regime.  I emphasise that no regime is perfect.  There will always be one or two things, even with PCR testing, that allow people to slip through.  That is not the game we are in.  We are in a numbers game.  It is a matter of trying to prevent most people passing on the virus and trying to allow them to be safe.  The combination of vaccination and rapid testing will allow that to be done.

They teach people how to take the sample because that is where there is quite a lot of inaccuracy.  It is about training people on how to take the sample, by self-training and so on.  As regards the accuracy of the test itself, as I said, the Joint Research Centre in the EU has a list of very good tests.  The accuracy with which the result is read is a simple matter.  For some tests it is necessary to wait 30 minutes.  If one tries to read them after five minutes one might not get the right result.  Again, that is about training.  That is the first thing.<\/p><p> In terms of deploying tests, serial testing really improves accuracy.  In the workplace, we recommend testing every two to three days.

I thank Professor Ferguson for joining us this afternoon.  There are a number of very compelling benefits and arguments to rapid antigen testing.  First, the cost factor.  It is approximately &euro;5 per antigen test versus a huge variance of anywhere from &euro;30 in North Macedonia, to approximately &euro;150 in Dublin Airport at the moment, for a PCR test.  There is a huge price variance.  The speed at which results come back is also an issue.  All of that has to be juxtaposed with the accuracy of the testing that is coming back.<\/p> <p>  Over the last number of weeks, I have looked in depth at the digital green certificate.  When this was first mooted, many people expected it would absolutely nail down that PCR tests were the only method of certification.  When the technical specification was issued last week, lo and behold, it mentioned certification of antigen testing.  It paves the way in the months ahead, as aviation gets back to some normality, that it will not always be just PCR testing.  There is some space in the room for rapid antigen testing and that needs to be looked at.<\/p> <p>  I come to Professor Ferguson with a proposal to see what he would think of it.  Perhaps our committee could then take action on it.  There is obviously a space here at the moment, with five or six lead-in weeks before the digital green certificate is operational throughout the EU.  Right now, each member state is working pretty much off its own rules, for better or worse.  A logical way of trialling this could be to pick one route in and out of Ireland with very few passengers, maybe a dozen or two dozen, where it is known who is on the aeroplane.  To entice passengers, they would not have to get a PCR test; they would be antigen tested and we will see how that would go.  The route could be Heathrow to Dublin as we unfortunately do not have Shannon routes at the moment, but it would be an in and out service.  That could be trialled over these few weeks until we have a European-wide regime.

The data would need to be collected, it would need to be seen that people did the test, reported the results and information was received on how many people did that and so on.  The Deputy's idea is a very good one.  If that was done, there are quite a lot of businesspeople travelling at the present time, and others who, I suspect, would volunteer to participate, particularly if they did not have to home isolate but would be allowed to go about their business.

What Professor Ferguson has delivered in terms of his 50-plus page report is something this country had needed for a number of months.  It is a rigorous and strong academic paper on the advantages of rapid mass antigen testing.  Professor Ferguson is chief scientific adviser to the Government of Ireland and the Government needs to take this on board.  Our aviation industry needs a pathway out of where it is at the moment.  It needed action months ago.  The initial report on aviation recovery was published last summer.  We have always been behind the eight ball on this.  We were told that antigen testing was not the gold standard.  Unfortunately, PCR testing was the enemy of the good for so long in terms of Government policy but Professor Ferguson has set out in detail how this can be ameliorated and managed and why there are such advantages to antigen testing.<\/p> <p>  I thank Professor Ferguson for his report, which needs to be taken on board.  I commend the Chairman on the urgency with which he has set out how the committee will deal with this matter.  Deputy Cathal Crowe's suggestion is very good.  I support it and am glad it will be included.<\/p> <p>  A few airports, such as those in Rome and Istanbul, have used antigen testing.  Representatives from Rome Airport appeared before the committee a number of months ago.  Did Professor Ferguson look at any further evidence of how their testing has continued over the past number of months, particularly through the winter wave, or did that fall outside the scope of his report?  I again thank him.  I cannot emphasise how important this is for our aviation industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#E00400","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":648,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, we did not look in any more detail at those airports.

To be honest, I have been baffled by the sluggish response from the HSE and NPHET.  It is very regrettable that such a valuable tool in our battle against Covid has not been advanced.  Hopefully, the work of the committee today can help to facilitate matters in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Can Professor Ferguson confirm whether an antigen test detects both symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers?  My position on this is very simple.  The test is easy to perform, generates rapid results and is relatively cheap.  It should be used in the construction industry, the hospitality and retail sectors and schools.  I am aware that a pilot project is under way in the context of construction.  Many private companies are using antigen testing very effectively.  Such testing is widely accepted across Europe.  It is advanced in the UK, Germany, France and Italy.  All across Europe, huge orders are being placed with companies manufacturing antigen tests.  My concern is that we will end up like we did with PPE at the start of the pandemic and manufacturing capacity will be full by the time we make a decision.<\/p> <p>  I am not happy about the delays in respect of this matter.  I raised it with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment last week.  As part of his response, he stated that the Government endorsed Professor Ferguson's report and that there were differences of opinion between scientists and public health doctors.  Could Professor Ferguson explain what these differences are and whether we can overcome them?  The political will to roll out antigen testing is there but there is resistance within NPHET and at senior level in the medical profession to this being deployed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#E00700","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":651,"content":"<p>Antigen testing does detect symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.  It is really useful in mass testing for asymptomatic individuals because if someone feels perfectly well, he or she may not be motivated to roll up for a test so that is really part of the advantage.<\/p> <p>  I cannot really tell the Deputy why people are resistant.  He would need to speak to those individuals but if we look at the data, we need to understand that a PCR test and an antigen test are about different things.  Since this is a transport committee, people often talk about the PCR test as being the Rolls Royce test.  According to this analogy, if one cannot have a Rolls Royce, one should not have any car but that is nonsense.  If I wanted to travel through Africa, I would not use a Rolls Royce, I would choose a Land Rover.  If I wanted to be green and save the planet, I would choose an electric car not a Rolls Royce that burns so much petrol per gallon.  What that tells us is that it depends on the question one is asking.  An antigen test basically detects infectious people.  It detects an individual who has a viral load and is likely to have live virus and transmit it to other people.  This is what we want to do.  We want to remove those infectious people from the workforce, the aeroplane or general society and get them to isolate until they are not infectious.  One then stops the spread of the virus.  A PCR test detects the nucleic acid of a virus and that tells a person when he or she has a very small amount of virus that is not infectious, tells him or her when he or she is infectious and tells him or her when he or she is post-infectious - in other words, he or she is way over having had the symptoms but still has some traces of the nucleic acid.  These tests are detecting different things.  An antigen test will not tell a person whether he or she has ever had Covid or whether he or she is over the virus, it just tells someone whether he or she is infectious at that stage.  The mentality that equates a PCR test with an antigen test is unhelpful.  They are detecting different things.<\/p> <p>  By definition, any self-administered test is less accurate than a professional test but there is plenty of precedent for this.  A woman can walk into a chemist shop, buy a pregnancy test and carry out that test and when she goes to the doctor, the doctor carries out another one so this is known.  As already stated, training is very important.  There are plenty of good videos.  Taking the sample is very easy to do.  Reading the test is very important and that can be aided with a photograph.  Selecting the right commercial test kit is also important.  Of course, no test is infallible.  There are about one in 1,000 false positives with an antigen test while there are false negatives as well and people need to be educated about that.  They need to be told that the test is not perfect but that is true of almost any test.  We just need to think about the different contexts of the test.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Professor Mark Ferguson"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":652,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Ferguson for being here today.

I guess it is the difference between a diagnostic for an individual patient and a screening device for the population.  A screening device for the population has to be easy to use, cheap, very straightforward and have a good degree of accuracy.  In my opinion, one in 1,000 is an acceptable level for a false test.  In the opinion of some other people, it is not.  They would want it to be one in 100,000 or whatever.  That is just a matter of opinion.  I think much of the worry is about the accuracy of the test.  Another worry is people misunderstanding the test, so they believe if they get a negative test they can go crazy.  This is what is called a risk transfer type of argument.  The same argument was made about condoms, seat belts and so forth, that people were going to misbehave.  That is not the way to look at it.<br\/><br\/>I view antigen testing in the context in which we are discussing it as a health and safety measure.  If one wears a bicycle helmet, does one ride the bicycle more dangerously than if one did not wear the helmet?  I do not think so.  It is the same type of argument here.  The people who are worried about testing worry partly about the accuracy <i>per se <\/i>and they worry about the potential behavioural changes that may occur after that.  My personal view is that the public are very well educated.  They know the challenges of Covid-19, and it is a terrible disease.  They are aware of the problems of severe lockdown and restriction of economic and social activity.  I believe that one should explain to people that this is a screening tool, a way of trying to increase the safety of the population and, as a Deputy said earlier, to give people confidence to go back onto an aeroplane or to go to a restaurant, hotel or to work.  Yes, there will be some cases where it is inaccurate and one may be one of the unfortunate people who get an inaccurate test but, by and large, it is much better than doing nothing and much better than having a complete lockdown.  Most people will understand that.  I have a great deal more faith in human nature, that most people will not misbehave and that they will do the test and comply.  We cannot devise a system for a very small number of people who are obviously not going to work it the way we would want.  The vast number of people would, because they are keen to get back to their lives.<br\/><br\/>That is clearly an opinion, and there are different opinions.  I have tried to summarise what I see as the opinion in this area.

One can see a flavour of that in the recommendations in the report.  The Department of Health is focused on rolling out the vaccination programme while looking at hospitals, general practitioners and so on.  It is for other the Departments, including Education, Transport and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to take the lead and to involve the HSE where appropriate.  The HSE is involved in the confirmatory PCR test.  One of the interesting things about our recommendations is that one can do the antigen test and then, if one tests positive, the confirmatory PCR test is not just about a confirmation of the test but bringing a person within the governance of the HSE, since he or she is now within that system.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome to the meeting Mr. Pat Dawson, CEO, and Mr. Paul Hackett, board member, of the Irish Travel Agents Association.  I thank the witnesses for attending the meeting at such short notice.<\/p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will, reluctantly, be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams to confirm their presence on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions to the meeting.<\/p> <p>  We have 45 minutes for this discussion and I want to allow as many questions as possible.  Mr. Hackett submitted a very good statement, which members will have read.

The airline refund process, specifically with regard to Ryanair, has improved.  It is not complete and is not working for everybody but compared with where we were when we first addressed this committee in October 2020, the position is much improved.  We attribute that in no small part to the coverage the matter received when raised at this committee.  For this reason, we thank the Chairman and members for the committee's assistance in helping to resolve this issue.<\/p> <p>  The travel industry, airports and airlines need clarity as to when we can restart trading with the safe reopening of international travel for our corporate and leisure markets.  Hotels in Ireland need to know if they can accept international visitors in 2021.  It is important to remember that 75% of income in the hospitality sector comes from the international market.  Until such time as full restart plans are announced, we are very keen to support the regional airports of Cork, Shannon and Knock.  We call on the Government to be generous in its support for all Irish airports and to support the pillar airlines on which we in Ireland rely.  We have heard that Cork airport will be closed for ten weeks from September.  To close a key regional airport just when international travel is restarting is not good.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission launched the digital green certificate on 17 March, almost two months ago.  The European Parliament last week voted to approve the certificates and recommended that they be renamed \"EU Covid19 certificates\".  This will be law in June and must be implemented by all member states within six to eight weeks.  This is a regulation.  It is not a pick-and-mix option, as mentioned by the Minister for Health on RT&Eacute; news last week.  It is mass harmonisation legislation, the objective of which is to have travel within the EU reopened safely with all EU member states adopting the certificates.  The Government must do this and, in so doing, it must revoke the advice against nonessential international travel.<\/p> <p>  As referenced earlier this week, on Monday, 3 May, we also need to open up to travel within and outside of the EU.  The UK and United States are core markets for Ireland's corporate and leisure travel.  The European Commission has announced a plan for Schengen member states to allow travel by fully vaccinated people and we urge the Government to adopt this proposal.<\/p> <p>  As matters stand, it is illegal to travel to a port or airport for nonessential travel.  Those who do so face a fine of &euro;2,000 per person.  There are 35 different statutory instruments, implemented since January this year, that control and limit international travel.  We need a plan and commitment to unwind these statutory instruments once the vaccination roll-out hits the level of 82% by the end of June, as is the current target.  On \"The Week in Politics\" programme last week, the Taoiseach stated we are an interconnected global island and we cannot seal off the island forever.  Taking all of this into account, as well as the improving position in our hospitals, the overall levels of Covid and the positivity around the vaccine roll-out, Ireland needs to implement the EU Covid19 certificates in full and without delay, open up to international visitors and allow Irish citizens the right to travel, at least within the EU to begin with.<\/p> <p>  We note our concern about the cost of PCR testing.  At approximately &euro;100 per person, PCR test costs are too high, antifamily and a cost deterrent for international travel.  We are surprised the Government has not adopted the recommendations of Professor Mark Ferguson's report on antigen testing and we note the irony that the HSE is using antigen testing in some facilities.<\/p> <p>  One important consideration around continued travel restrictions in the Republic is that international travel will recommence from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s airports some time between midMay and midJune.  We have already seen Ryanair open a new base in Belfast City Airport adding ten new routes.  Moving assets from the Republic of Ireland is very easy to do for both Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  Both airlines have been forced to do so given there is no plan to open Ireland for international travel.<\/p> <p>  Bookings for international travel are still around 85% down and there will be no recovery until consumer confidence returns.  No other sector has had little or no income since March 2020.  Irish hotels had some income last summer but travel agents had none.  A reduction in income of between 85% and 95% effectively amounts to minus income as our cost base, even with massive reductions, is still substantial.  We have met Ministers in the Department of Transport, members of all political parties and countless Deputies and Senators, all of whom have been understanding and sympathetic to our plight, but what pocket do we put that into?  Sympathy and understanding are not something we can pass on to our landlords, IT providers, insurance companies and the staff we must retain.<\/p> <p>  There is a delay of between six and nine months between booking and travel, which means our sector must work for between six and nine months before we count the income generated from advance bookings.  So long as there is no income, the travel industry needs to see ongoing support from the Government.  We are getting the wage subsidy and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  The CRSS needs to be repurposed and linked to guidance on international travel.  We hope to see extensions of support beyond 30 June.  The travel industry needs to see supports continue until we no longer meet the qualifying criteria.  The support is needed now ahead of the restart to financially rebuild in order to reduce our dependency on the State.  Without ongoing and targeted sector-specific supports, there will be more failures in our industry.  There is no need for that to happen.  Customers have full protection because all travel agents are licensed and bonded, so additional support will prevent company failures.<\/p> <p>  Before I finish, we need to bring a matter to the committee's attention.  As a result of Covid19 and the impact on the travel industry, some merchant service providers are taking a very hard line and demanding substantial cash deposits from travel agents.  This is a direct challenge to the bonding and licensing arrangements the Government has in place for travel agents.  Some of the companies involved are associated with our partially Stateowned banks.  This is a very serious issue for the sector and the Government must address it given that it has poured millions into supporting the sector during the pandemic, only to have the very future of the sector put at risk by these staggering demands for cash security.  I thank the Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hackett"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":685,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hackett.

The merchant service providers are the companies that facilitate merchant retailers, including travel agents like us, to accept credit cards.  It is the technical piece whereby we accept the card from the consumer.  We are bonded and licensed by the Commission for Aviation Regulation and therefore there is zero risk.  There has been some exposure to the merchant service providers for travel that is outside the bonding and licensing arrangement.  People who book accommodation only or flight only directly with an airline are not covered under the bonding and protection.  However, our sector is fully protected.  The merchant service people are effectively requesting a double bonding mechanism whereby we provide them with additional cash security over and above the bonding that we are providing through the Commission for Aviation Regulation.<\/p> <p>  This is a cash drain.  There simply is no risk attachable to what they are talking about.  It is really important for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the Department of Transport and the Department of Finance - because some of these entities are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland - to look at and get transparency from these companies as to where they assess the risk.  We have asked them to quantify this risk and show us where they have been left out of pocket.

I welcome the witnesses.  We have heard from representatives of the aviation sector and others in the tourism industry of the need for a lead-in period.  The opening statement indicates that there is usually a six- to nine-month period from the time of booking to the time of travelling.  Has the lead-in period for summer 2021 already passed by?  We are all anticipating some form of resumption.  We hope there will be a fairly buoyant domestic tourism market.  Representatives of the Irish Travel Agents Association are heavily dependent on international tourism and we all expect a return to international travel in the mid-summer period.<\/p> <p>  The big concern is that consumers are fickle.  At the moment people are clambering over each other to get bookings in west Clare, Westport, Killarney and all over Ireland.  However, as soon as it is possible for them to fly to Gran Canaria and other such places, I expect we will see a shift in demand.  I am concerned that as Irish consumers move from west of Ireland hotel breaks to international travel, it may create a vacuum.  Will we see a return of the North American travellers to fill that vacuum?  How are the witnesses strategising for the shoulder season beyond the summer?  What lead-in period do they need?

There is a small improvement in trading, but from being 95% down to being 85% down is not much to brag about.  Consumers need confidence and that will come from the vaccine roll-out and the implementation of the digital green certificates.  Until that is clear, we will not see consumers booking.  Consumers have had so many lost opportunities and cancellations on holidays last year and earlier this year that with the vaccination piece now in sight, they are waiting until they have clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  As regards the internal market, naturally if we open within the EU, I am sure that Irish hotels and the Irish hospitality sector will dearly welcome internal traffic from other EU states into Ireland.  That should be in place.  Regarding our booking period, that is the lag-time between when people pay a deposit and when they travel.  We do not count the profit until they travel.

I thank Mr. Dawson and Mr. Hackett for their presentation to the committee.  I have an observation to make on what has been going on here in recent months that has very much damaged the entire industry - travel agents, international travel, aviation and all of the jobs in tourism that stem from that.  I refer to the attitude taken by some to international travel.  Something I hear from a lot of people working in tourism in Ireland is that they are very worried about the current level of public confidence in international travel.  That is something I have spoken about in this committee previously and it is an issue that the Oireachtas as a whole needs to address.  Thankfully, we are heading for a situation whereby at the end of June 80% of the Irish population are expected to receive either their first dose or to be fully vaccinated.  That should very much put us on a springboard to allow people to start international travel for inbound travellers into Ireland, which is obviously fantastic for hotels in this country, and for travel in general but also to allow Irish citizens to travel abroad.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses have identified two very significant issues in their contributions today and I wish to pick up on them.  One is the fact that Ireland was part of the common travel area with the United Kingdom, in the sense that we had an existing arrangement prior to Brexit and that we are not part of the Schengen Agreement, which is ploughing ahead with its own plans for international travel.  I want to utilise my time in the committee today to say, as a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and its spokesperson on transport, how important it is that we would follow suit with the Schengen plan and work with the countries in the Schengen area to allow Irish travellers to go to the United States once we have reached a satisfactory level of vaccination of the population.  We are getting there very quickly.  There is no doubt that we are making progress.  We all know it was difficult and slow to start but, thankfully, it is now progressing.  Reopening the US-Ireland travel channel is incredibly important for the travel industry.  To put it into perspective, I spoke to one hotelier yesterday who told me that 65% of his bookings in a luxury 5 star hotel on the west coast comprised travellers coming into Ireland from the United States, and 75% of his revenue was as a result of bookings from the United States.  That just shows the level of importance it has for the economy.  If we want people coming in, we need to let people go out as well, which is important.  I know a lot of people give out that it is money exiting the economy, but travel agents in Ireland are doing well out of it and domestic airlines do well from international travel and business as well as people working in Irish airports.  That must all be stated.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked a question earlier about where the calls need to go.  It is obvious that NPHET must be involved.  From my reading of the situation, NPHET is the one causing the difficulties for the witnesses.  In fairness, I think at a ministerial level many of the Departments want to see travel open up again.  I heard off the record from many different Ministers and people working in Departments that they want to see antigen testing being put in place and they want to see movement in that regard following on from the academic reports that have been done, but the issue seems to be NPHET.  That is my reading of the situation.  To do some justice to everybody who has come before the committee, perhaps it is time for us to look for NPHET to come before the committee again.  It obliged us before and it is high time that we would bring it back again.  I will ask one question and finish up then.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#L01100","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":747,"content":"<p>We have made the decision to invite NPHET.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#L01200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":748,"content":"<p>That is great.

We must be seen to move and get our act together quickly to get tourists back because Americans can go to plenty of other countries.

The problem is that this season is lost and we must now work on the next season.  In terms of inbound and outbound tourism, not alone do we send many hundreds of thousands of people on city breaks to San Francisco, Florida, New York and Las Vegas, etc., but there have also been increased flights out of Ireland over the last number of years with American carriers and Aer Lingus.

The Schengen proposal that was announced on Monday is the way for us to open up to the UK and the US, which is vital.  Whenever we speak, even though the ITAA is involved in outbound activity, we would always be focused as well on our inbound counterparts and the domestic travel industry, which is hugely important in this country.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy quite rightly said, 75% of the income for the hotel and hospitality business in Ireland comes from the international market.  One cannot have outbound without inbound.  The ITAA and ITIC work in hand in glove.  We support the airlines because the airlines and the airports need traffic both ways.  No route is going to be a single directional route and traffic must go both ways in order for it to be viable so our connectivity is critically important.  It was great to hear An Taoiseach the other day recognise that we are a global connected island.  We have got to get back to that.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy quite rightly said, international travel has been very unfairly demonised when other things are still sorely missing such as the community transmission numbers, and test and trace stack up to that.

I welcome our guests and thank them for their interesting and informative contributions.  We have had them here on a number of occasions.  I hope they will agree that the committee has listened and supported their case.  I am very much in favour of reopening the economy.  To do so we must reopen airports and allow our people to travel out and others to come in.<\/p> <p>  I raised the issue of a digital green certificate with the Taoiseach some months ago.  At that stage, the Government had set its face against a digital green certificate.  I firmly believe that there should be a vaccination dividend and if somebody is fully vaccinated he or she should be allowed the freedom to move around.  The analogy I would draw is that somebody who refuses to take a vaccination damages our prospects of recovering from the pandemic.  Therefore, the people who are fully vaccinated should be able to travel in a safe way.  We, as a country, were reluctant and hesitant about using a digital green certificate.  The only reason Ireland is in it is because we were forced into it by the EU.  I fear that the Irish Government will drag its heels when it comes to implementation.  I ask the witnesses to forward to us the statements they issued to the Government and the Department of Transport on this matter so that we can be aware of what we need to push.  I certainly will push for advancing the digital green certificate, in line with other European Union countries, as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  We certainly must be cognisant of the Schengen Agreement and be on a level playing pitch.  There is no doubt that inward traffic is required to reboot the industry and, in particular, get the people who work at our airports back into meaningful employment and start to rebuild so much that we have lost over the last two years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#M01200","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":762,"content":"<p>Do Mr. Hackett and Mr. Dawson view the digital green certificate pass as the single most important element to getting the aviation industry, and by extension the economy, reopened in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2021050500002#M01300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":763,"content":"<p>I do.

The certificate is the only thing that is going to get us out of this mess and that is why it is nearly but not quite as urgent as vaccination.  We cannot play ducks and drakes with the certificate.  We must get somebody in the Government to take charge of the certificate and we need this committee to push for it, and check where we are.

My heart goes out to the members of the ITAA.  We have seen one of the biggest travel agents go and it was synonymous with Irish travel for many years.  Having lost a business many years ago, I can say that it was my fault.  For those who are going out of business in the travel industry at the moment, it is not their fault and the situation is most unfortunate.<\/p> <p>  There is one theme that is the elephant in the room.  The Department of Health is running everything and the master of the witnesses' organisation is the Department of Transport.  I am concerned that the Department of Health has too many tentacles and that one cannot keep all the balls in the air without dropping some.  So, I am interested in hearing what the witnesses have to say about the matter.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs was very positive in his support for trying to get the economy back running as normal as possible.<\/p><p>With that in mind, I note the witnesses constantly referenced the IT sector.  Are they aware of the development of a mobile app that will allow people to present their phone at the airport to show that they have been vaccinated or had the virus or both, or have not been vaccinated, as the case may be, in order to facilitate travel?  We have to get people back in the air.  There are airline pilots who are desperately trying to keep their licence up to date.  There are travel agents struggling to keep their business going.  I learned today that there will be a sort of six to nine month lag before the small few travel agents that will still be in business will start to see profits coming back in.<\/p><p> Do the witnesses see the same elephant in the room that I see?

We have amazing connectivity and an amazing hospitality industry.  We have to get back our welcome to outside visitors and get them in.  The digital green certificate has to be seen as something that is respectful of public health and is the solution in that regard.  It is not a passport; it is a certificate.  It covers one's vaccination status.  If one has not been vaccinated, one needs a PCR test.  If one does not wish to do that and has recovered from Covid, that is it.  It is very fair.
