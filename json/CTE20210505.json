I remind those present that apart from myself and members of the committee secretariat, all members and witnesses are required to participate remotely and from within the Leinster House complex only.  As normal, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated on MS Teams.<\/p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment made a formal request to the Business Committee that pre-legislative scrutiny for the Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2021 be waived.  The Bill complies with the advice of the Attorney General and provides the necessary powers to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to continue to administer justice in accordance with the Constitution.  The need for the Bill arose following a recent Supreme Court judgment in the Zalewski case.  The request from the T&aacute;naiste to the Business Committee for a waiver of pre-legislative consideration has been passed on to this committee in order that it might give its opinion on the request.  A copy of the request has been sent to all members.  Following today's meeting, we are required to communicate our opinion to the Business Committee in order for it to decide on the application for a waiver.  I welcome Ms Tara Coogan and Ms &Aacute;ine Maher from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and thank them for the briefing they gave some members last week.<\/p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to persons in their evidence.  The evidence of a witness physically present or who gives evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses are again reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or may charges against any person or entity by name or in a way in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such decision.  <\/p> <p>  The opening statement was circulated to members in order to allow them to commence their consideration of this matter.  I invite Ms Coogan to make some brief opening remarks on behalf of the Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I am appearing before the committee to discuss the Workplace Relations (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2021.  As the Chairman noted, the urgency in respect of this Bill arises from a recent Supreme Court decision which , on the one hand, saved the WRC's adjudication service but, on the other, found certain provisions within the statutory framework giving the WRC its powers to be constitutionally repugnant.<\/p> <p>  In essence, what this Bill proposes to do is address those immediate matters identified by the Supreme Court.  Currently, all matters before the adjudication service in the WRC would be held entirely in private.  That has now been found by the courts to be inconsistent with what is known as administration of justice.  While the Supreme Court is not saying that everything and anything must be done in public, some consideration must be given to those matters and we will address that issue in this short Bill.  The second issue, which means that adjudication cannot continue and cannot be effectively concluded until this provision has been introduced in law, is  that the Supreme Court was very critical of the fact that there was no provision in the statutory framework for the adjudication service which provides for the administration of an oath or affirmation and an associated penalty for a person who may wilfully give false evidence or mislead an adjudication officer.<\/p> <p>  Those are the two matters that the Bill will immediately address.  Due to the nature of the WRC and the various items of legislation under which it is responsible for carrying out investigations, these amendments will also need to be carried to be carried to the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  My Department has been co-operating with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  While these amendments relate to procedural matters within the WRC and, as such, do not really relate to the policies under these particular Acts, it has been proposed that these matters would be addressed in this very short Bill in an effective way so that we can get over the difficulty that means that adjudications cannot be concluded and address the immediate concerns the Supreme Court orders identified.  Unfortunately, those orders had immediate effect so we were not given any grace period by the Supreme Court.<\/p> <p>  There are other small procedural matters that we propose to amend.  They relate to the independence of Labour Court members.  While it has never really been an issue, industrial relations legislation is missing that express statement so we are proposing to carry those amendments as well.<\/p> <p>  This is an immediate and urgent measure that we are proposing to take so that we can continue to provide the service to the people of Ireland in the WRC.  However, it is clear that once we have overcome this obstacle, we will have to examine the lengthy judgments of the Supreme Court, consider policy matters in more detail and engage with the committee in the more normal legislative process.  I am here to take any questions members may have and appreciate the committee giving me this time.  I am here because this is genuinely an urgent matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":7,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coogan.

I thank both officials for the briefing they provided.  It was very useful.  I fully appreciate that this is an urgent situation.  I am very concerned, as I think we all are, by the idea that hearings cannot now proceed and that an awful lot of people have been left in limbo.  We teased out some of these concerns at our meeting but, for the purposes of the record, I have a concern about people who have commenced cases.  Many cases do not finish quickly.  In an ideal world, a person would get in and get out in one day.  As anyone who has been before the WRC, the Labour Court or other forums will know, however, one does not always get in and get out in one day.  Very often, a further hearing can be scheduled for a date a couple of months into the future.  For those cases that have been partially concluded, we are going to have to make special arrangements, although I do not know if that is possible or how it can be done.  Given the strength of the view expressed by the Supreme Court, it strikes me that they cannot be concluded under the same system.<\/p> <p>  When An Bord Altranais, as the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland was formerly known, changed over, there was a facility for people who started under the old system of fitness to practice hearings to retain that.  However, I do not think that is going to be the case in this instance and I welcome Ms Coogan's view on this.  In the event that it is not, consideration must be given to a person who started under one system believing it was going to be one way.  I refer specifically to the anonymity, which is very attractive for some workers and, perhaps, not for some employers.  We need to consider that and try to figure out how to treat a person who took a case and is halfway through it now.  We must also be cognisant of the need for private hearings.  There must be some involvement from the stakeholders as well.  It cannot simply be that an adjudication officer just decides because there will be instances where both parties may want the hearing held in private.  Perhaps that should be facilitated.  I fully respect what the Supreme Court said but my understanding - and I am open to correction on this - is that it found that hearings cannot always be in private and that there must be some sort of latitude.  I caution that some workers would be very hesitant about coming forward if they do not believe they can have some level of anonymity and that must be catered for just as it is for whistleblowers, where it is very important.<\/p> <p>  On the oath, it strikes me as a bit odd that we would have an oath in any event but I understand where it comes from and appreciate that it might be necessary.  However, an affirmation is much more preferable and inclusive.  It includes everybody, so I favour that.<\/p> <p>  I made this next point at our meeting but will make it again for the record.  Time is ticking and we appreciate that but I raise the provision of a fairly robust review clause, bearing in mind that we will do this quickly.  Of course, it must be done quickly and I appreciate that.  There are people waiting but we must recognise that when we act fast, we sometimes do not get everything right.  Since that might be the case, there should be a very robust provision for review that includes engagement with people who are using the system, not a desk-based review but something that actually talks to trade union officials, employer representatives and employment rights lawyers so we get the sense of whether it is working or not.  I am conscious of the requirement to act in haste.  In that context, we may repent at our leisure.  If, however, there is a review clause built in, we can then test the measures that have been introduced.  The purpose of this is obviously to ensure that the measures work for everybody.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#B00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy.  We are not going to be making a blanket provision to have absolutely everything in public.  There will be a provision.  The way it is proposed to be drafted, the policy will be that it is for parties to raise the issue with an adjudication officer and the parties will be given an opportunity to state their cases.  This means that there will be a decision made on this particular issue.  Obviously, there will also be an issue in the context of the naming of decisions because there is a public website, which is very useful and which is a very good way for justice to be visible.  Again, that is another matter the adjudication officer will be given absolute discretion to enquire into but also decide on.  That is one of those situations where an adjudication officer could, in the interests of special circumstances and depending on the types of people making claims, whether individuals who do not have legal representation may not understand what is involved or the fact that there could be a minor at the heart of a particular complaint, especially on the equal status side, make a decision and offer reasons therefor.  Again, there would be an understanding why something was done in a specific way.  That kind of discretion will be built into the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I agree that when this settles down we will have a better understanding of what is involved.  At the moment, depending on which side of the House I am speaking to, we almost have Supreme Court procedures being introduced, on the one hand, and then others looking for something else.  The WRC is a very unique place.  It deals with very simple matters and very complex matters and what we are trying to do is find the right balance whereby we are ensuring the administration of justice, that fairness is at the heart of it, that it is transparent and of a standard but at the same time it does not become a ten-year process.<\/p> <p>  The other issue the Deputy mentioned was what will happen to hearings currently in train.  I suspect some that have been halfway heard and that, where there was an adjournment, may have to be started again.  This might have to be before a new adjudication officer, in certain circumstances.  This is due to the fact that there might have been evidence obtained or a situation that took place without the oath provision.  As a result, there will be some disruption.  There is no point in me telling the Deputy this is all hunky-dory.  There will be some challenges.  The people in the WRC are doing their utmost.  They are consulting, talking and engaging with and writing to parties in order to try find solutions.  What everybody is being offered is an opportunity to revert to mediation which is a quick and private process.  Unfortunately, some of these issues will arise in the next few weeks as matters proceed.  There are some cases which will be able to proceed and to be concluded but there is now this issue, which is a real risk issue.<\/p> <p>  On the review clause, I have spoken to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, OPC, about the inclusion of such a thing and welcome any other members' views on it.  I see no problem with something like that.  As a civil servant, I must carry out reviews.  Every 12 months there is a post-enactment review, which I carry out.  There is absolutely no harm in doing something like that so I will talk to the OPC about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2021050500002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Tara Coogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Coogan and Ms Maher for presenting.  Unfortunately, I missed the previous briefings so maybe I will go over ground that has already been covered.<\/p> <p>  I would first like clarification that there is no need for retroactive provision in respect of case that have already been determined, there is no way in which there is any frailty for those.  My second question relates to what the frailty was in respect of false evidence.  Was it purely the fact no oath was taken or does this raise the need for some penalty provision being available to the WRC where someone fails to answer honestly?  I thought penalties of that nature could not be imposed other than by a court.  As a result, I am wondering exactly what line has been drawn by the Supreme Court.<\/p><p>Ms Coogan indicated there may be other policy matters raised by the judgment which may have to come back to the committee.  Perhaps she will indicate what those might be.<\/p><p> I was involved when much of this reform went through.  We were trying to reform an extremely legalistic provision where the process was slow, there was duplication and people were bringing in armies of lawyers.  The process had become very legalistic.  It is encouraging that it has stood the test of a challenge, other than in respect of what seemed relatively minor areas of difficulty, notwithstanding the importance of correcting them.<\/p><p> I commend the WRC on the work it has been doing and those who helped to bring through the reforms.

Going forward, however, this will be an issue.  Thankfully, we do not have to revisit the thousands of decisions that have been made at the WRC in the past six years.<\/p> <p>  The second question was on penalties.  The Supreme Court obviously felt there was a need to have the oath.  It was not really the oath or the affirmation but, rather, the idea of having a potential penalty associated with wilfully giving false evidence.  This is about the \"liar, liar\" type of person, or somebody who is wilfully misleading or abusing the judicial process.  It is to ensure there is a type of penalty associated with that.  It was a kind of package deal.  Since the WRC is not a normal court, \"perjury\" is not the associated term.  We will be providing for an offence.  I will be honest with the committee in saying I cannot see this becoming a regular feature but if a person was blatantly and clearly misleading or maliciously giving false evidence, the matter would then be referred to the courts for normal prosecution.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the policy matters, some concerns were expressed about the independence, skills and qualifications of the persons who are carrying out the adjudication service.  While O'Donnell was categorically clear that there was no constitutional requirement for these persons to be fully legally qualified, there are a number of minority decisions that disagreed with that particular provision.  We would look at the recruitment, skills, training and development and making sure people have the relevant skills and necessary understanding.<\/p> <p>  Another issue, which I should have mentioned and which will be addressed immediately in this Bill, is the unique statement in section 40 of the Workplace Relations Act that the Minister may revoke a warrant of appointment.  That would never happen in practice but the reality is that these words were somewhat alarming to the Supreme Court.  We will now provide a clear process setting out what would happen if a Minister were to revoke or remove an adjudication officer from office.  There is now the issue of adjudication officers as administrators of justice and what this means in the context of the system.  These are the kinds of bigger questions we must tease out.<\/p> <p>  We will have to look at some of the issues that are in the minority decisions.  While they are not binding, they will certainly have a persuasive element.  I hope I have addressed everything for Deputy Bruton.

There is simply no way around that.  The Supreme Court has given us quite a bit of leeway on how to do this.  We can do it in a way that will be fair and will address any genuine and real concerns out there.  For example, on the idea that hearings would be in public, the reality is that hearings are currently held like this meeting.  A person could, in writing, ask the WRC to sit in on a hearing, albeit remotely.  Most people who ask to sit in on hearings of this nature are family members, and sometimes it will be a member of the media.  I do not believe this will become a place that is overrun by members of the public observing proceedings.  There is sometimes a benefit to hearings being held in public.<\/p> <p>  We are giving broad discretion to the adjudication officer, the fundamental decision maker and the person who is in control of the facts of a particular case, to address issues such as anonymity and privacy.  I want the committee to understand that the WRC has done Trojan work trying to catch up with Covid-related delays.  It has carried out extensive consultations with stakeholders and has done whatever it could to put in place a very effective remote hearing system.  When we had this decision, the WRC had just started scheduling very large numbers of cases and for once it did not have the constraints of room availability, etc.  As such, there are some benefits to this type of scenario.  Unfortunately, there will be disruptions but I am sure that once we get over the initial changes and the shock they will bring, as well as the unfortunate delays, the WRC will be in a position to resume hearings again.  As I said, there will be some cases in which, in the interests of justice, it will be necessary to start again.  I appreciate that will be very frustrating for parties.  I hope they will understand.

It is important to highlight the context in which these allegations were made.  The Minister for Health is named from time to time as a defendant in litigation cases.  This was the situation in a number of cases dating back to the early 1990s related to special educational needs taken against the State.  In approximately 230 of these cases the Department of Health and the Department of Education are co-defendants, and 29 of these cases remain open.  They could be active or dormant but they are open in that they have not been settled through mediation or court settlements.  As is the practice, both Departments are jointly represented by the Chief State Solicitor's office, under the co-ordination of the Office of the Attorney General.  The long-standing approach of both the Department of Education and the Department of Health to students with special educational and health needs is to seek to ensure the provision of the appropriate services for those students as best they can.  It is only where the suitability of such services is contested that litigation ensues.  The Department always seeks, in the first instance, to resolve proceedings on appropriate terms where possible.  The majority of concluded cases have been resolved by the parties involved through mediation and not by the courts.  That is an important point to emphasise.<\/p> <p>  As members will be aware, the allegations previously brought to the Department of Health's attention in February 2020 through a protected disclosure were subject to an independent review by senior counsel.  This was completed in November 2020 and published on 21 April last.  I have shared a copy of this review with the committee.  The Chair and I spoke about this.  The reason for the delay in sharing that with the committee was to ensure that the rights of the discloser were protected, that consent had been received and that we had gone through all the necessary processes to ensure that.  The committee will be aware that this review assessed an allegation of gathering and sharing of information regarding special educational needs litigation related to correspondence and spreadsheets.  It found that there was no basis for a reasonable belief of wrongdoing, as defined in the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  It also outlined that the information shared between the parties is consistent with, and typical of, the sort of information that arises in such litigation.  The report is very detailed and goes through the types of information that were provided by the whistleblower to counsel.  It sets out the context, conclusions and assessments on foot of the review.<\/p> <p>  Following the RT&Eacute; broadcast and the allegations it contained, I set up a team in the Department to establish the facts surrounding specific allegations made in the programme and related articles on the RT&Eacute; website.  The team was supported by three independent barristers who acted as external documentary review counsel.  This, in effect, involved going through files and establishing what was on them and the extent to which the allegations were made were true.  This report was also published on 21 April and a copy has been made available to members of the committee.<\/p><p> I will set out some important facts that have been established based on this independent review.  First, the Department of Health has never gathered sensitive medical or educational information on children involved in court cases in the manner portrayed by RT&Eacute;.  Second, there is no evidence the Department of Health was secretly compiling dossiers on children with autism involved in special educational needs litigation, as alleged by the RT&Eacute; programme.  As a co-defendant in litigation cases, the Department of Health may have documents on file that form part of the proceedings.  Such files contain information arising in the course of the proceedings, including the pleadings and correspondence received from all parties, including plaintiffs.  Most of the information on file includes the information provided by plaintiffs in the course of their pleadings setting out the case they wish to make and the basis on which they are taking a case against the State.  I think there has been some misunderstanding about the nature of the information that is held.  Most of the information was provided by the plaintiffs or provided in pursuit of their action by their legal representatives.  There is no evidence that the Department of Health is prying on families.  I use the word \"prying\" because that was the term used in the RT&Eacute; programme.  I am not entirely sure what was meant by that but the word is generally meant in a pejorative way, suggesting something underhand or covert, and there is absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever.  There is no evidence the Department of Health gathered information that was beyond instructions as part of the normal defence of a litigation case.  Based on the review from the evidential barristers, this was confirmed in the original review by Conleth Bradley.  The information held on file was of the type one would expect to see in cases such as these.  I have had a chance to look through some of the summary information and it is of the type one would expect to see: the name of the plaintiff, his or her legal representative, the case he or she is making, the status of the case and so on, along with accompanying documentation, in the main, as I said, provided by the plaintiffs.  There is no evidence the Department of Health sought updates or reports on plaintiffs directly from schools or the Department of Education.  There is no evidence the Department of Health sought clinical reports on plaintiffs directly from clinicians.<\/p><p> There are data protection issues, which the various papers identify, and we welcome the inquiry by the Data Protection Commission, which is investigating data collection practices in this area.  Of course, the Department is co-operating with the Data Protection Commissioner and will gladly take on board any recommendations the commission may have in respect of how we could do better in this area, if that is the conclusion and recommendations arising from the review.<\/p><p> I know the headlines generated by the programme have caused distress to some of the families concerned.  Accordingly, the Department of Health appointed an independent support liaison officer to engage directly with the 29 families involved in these allegations.  I have personally written to each of the families through their solicitors on file offering an opportunity to engage with him.  I have also endeavoured to keep in touch with stakeholder organisations.  On 1 April, I provided an update via open letter and further on 21 April, when the two reports were published, and I shared these with the organisations.  I again underlined that their role representing many patients and families affected by autism is valued.  I continue to be committed to engaging with them and informing them of updates on this issue as we go forward.  The mission of the Department of Health, and the mission of me and my colleagues, is to improve the health and well-being of people in Ireland.  The core priority of the Department over the past year has been the response to the Covid pandemic.  The intense work in continuing to respond to the impact of the pandemic on our nation's health and on the services we deliver will continue long after society has reopened and the last vaccine has been administered.<\/p><p> I look forward to our discussion today.  I assure the committee of our commitment to delivering on the Department's priorities.  The health and well-being of the people who use the health service is at the centre of all the decisions we take within the Department.  I am very happy to engage with any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Watt.

I am not in the practice of disclosing the contents of private conversations but I did note that the conversation was reported in the papers, which was a bit of a surprise.  The context was that \"Prime Time\" had written to the Department several weeks before the programme was due to be broadcast to give a broad indication of some of the things it would say.  It did not share the full details and did not give us an opportunity, as far as I am aware, to review the programme.  We were, however, aware of the issues and were involved in correspondence with them, setting out our position, so we had some sense of the allegations that had been made.  We were conscious of two things: first, that the allegations were extremely serious and would cause distress to families if they were made publicly and, second, that we did not believe the allegations were true.  I wanted to ensure that the director general of RT&Eacute; in her role understood the gravity of the allegations and that they were as serious as could be.  It was suggested that officials of a Department were prying on citizens or engaged in covert operations, secret dossiers and so on.  This type of language and these types of allegations are serious.  First, I wanted to make sure that the director general understood the seriousness of the allegations, which after the conversation I think she did.  Second, based on what I had seen and what had been brought to my attention, and based on the whistleblower's report, which I had understood RT&Eacute; had at that stage - elements of it if not all of it; the whistleblower himself had certainly briefed people on it - I wanted to say to the director general that we did not believe the allegations were correct, and I set out why we did not believe they were, and that I did not think it was appropriate for RT&Eacute; to make such serious allegations.  That was the basic sense of the conversation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>Post the broadcasting of the programme, has the Department had subsequent discussions with the director general or any other senior official in RT&Eacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#B00700","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Not with the director general, but I have spoken to others.

We were as uneasy and as appalled as anybody else when we saw the programme.  Officials in the Department were as upset about what was said and the distress that it may cause families, as well as the fact that the allegations were untrue.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy in that if it is established, which it might be subsequently, that there is no validity behind these allegations, which will be up to others to decide, the damage, unfortunately, still will have been done.  People may not necessarily look back at what the final outcome to this is.  They will have watched the programme or heard the discussion about it.  Unfortunately, no matter what the outcome is, trust can be eroded.  The Deputy is correct that no matter what happens, that is a regrettable outcome of this.  Where responsibility lies for that is for others to decide.<\/p> <p>  On the question about cases taken, I will reiterate the point that the majority of cases do not go to court.  Only two of the 230 cases had actually gone to court.  Most of these are settled.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider issue, which I guess is the kernel of the Deputy's question and which is a policy question, about people taking cases against the State in order to improve access to services.  There is a question about the State's position about whether it should contest or accept them.  As we said in response to earlier questions, in many cases the evidence presented by the plaintiffs is such that the State will accept, settle quickly and will not contest the case.<\/p> <p>  There is a wider policy question, however.  Citizens have rights and have the right to have those rights vindicated legally through the courts.  That is how our Constitution and our legal system works.  I do not think there is ever going to be a situation where we find that families are 100% satisfied with the service they receive.  There is never going to be a situation where everybody will be satisfied all the time.  That is the nature of it.  It is a contested and challenging space.  We would like a situation where it never came to people taking cases.  We would like a situation where the services provided were met to the satisfaction of all the families all the time.  Sometimes, however, people do not believe that and they want more and better.  They have a right to challenge that.<\/p> <p>  From the State's perspective, which gets to the absolute essence of the discussion, the question is what is the role of the State in this regard.  Should the State not contest the cases?  If the State did not contest cases, services would be provided not on the basis of laws passed in the Oireachtas and then the administration of those laws by Departments.  Instead, the prioritisation of service provision would be on the basis of who has access to the legal system and solicitors.  If Departments did not challenge or accepted the case whenever a service was deemed to be inadequate, in effect the system would be gummed up forever with legal challenges.  The basis upon which we actually administer schemes would fall down.  It would not be on the basis of need but who has access to legal representation.  Nobody believes such a course of action would be desirable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#J00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Robert Watt"},{"type":"speech","time":1620169200,"counter":261,"content":"<p>I understand the dimensions around this.

The public, either those who watched that programme or are watching this public session, will be struggling to marry how these allegations could have been made without any basis in truth, as Mr. Watt has said.  He has said there was no basis for those allegations, that they were untrue and had no validity behind them.<\/p> <p>  People are really struggling to marry those two things and there is an enormous responsibility, if these allegations are untrue, to comprehensively prove so, because the reputational damage being done is immense.  The reason this struck a chord is that no matter what way one slices this, there are, have been and continue to be vulnerable children who have been forced to take action against the State in order to get their basic educational needs met.  Notwithstanding that the allegations are possibly not valid, in the words of Mr. Watt, there is a larger issue at stake that vulnerable families and children have been mucked about under the watch of the Department of Health.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt said this has been a long-standing practice and I know a couple of people have alluded as to whether that is still a correct practice.  Would Mr. Watt say that is an ethical practice?  I am not a lawyer and the law has to do what it has to do, but this struck a chord with people for a reason.  One of the reasons is the ethics behind it.  Is it an ethical thing to have done?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Watt has said these practices will continue to take place.  He mentioned these cases often end in mediation.  Surely, the answer should be that these cases end in the families and vulnerable children getting what they are entitled to, which is access to an education.  We are talking about cases being outstanding and what is going to be done.  Truly, based on the public response and the feeling in this, the answer should be that no one should have to do this in the first place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#K00900","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Hoey that the allegations are extraordinary and people will find it difficult to marry the programme with the documentary evidence that we have published and prepared.  That is for others to decide.  It has done reputational damage and we are trying to address that, as best we can, but it is hard to address that fully.<\/p> <p>  Of course, the practices that are alleged are not ethical and they did not take place, as I have set out.  Clearly, our prying on families and having secret dossiers would be inappropriate but that did not take place.  I know Senator Hoey is not talking about those ethical practices, she is referring to whether sharing information and challenging the cases is ethical.<\/p> <p>  On the sharing of the information, it is seen as an efficient way for co-defendants to try to manage the cases efficiently and resolve, mediate and settle the cases.  It is based on administrative efficiency rather than having one part of the case in one part of the system and so on, because the Department of Education, the HSE or the Department of Health could be involved.  It makes sense for the information to be shared so that we have one file on all the different elements relevant to the case and its potential settlement.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of sharing the information, we are satisfied of the administrative necessity and legality.  Can we share that better and be more secure about it?  Yes, of course.  We are looking at that and accept we can always do better.<\/p> <p>  The other ethical question is about service access and that is the key question here.  We are trying to improve services.  It is about, all the time, trying to improve services so that families do not have to take cases, the system provides the best possible services and, where possible, families are happy or content but, at least, accept more is being done or they are getting the supports they can.  Ultimately, that is the objective and what we are about in the Department.<\/p> <p>  There have been significant improvements in recent years.  Significant investment has taken place and enhanced services have been provided for people with special educational needs right across the area.  Of course, we all know we can do better and that is the objective.<\/p> <p>  On the wider ethical question about contesting cases, I have nothing further to add to what I said to Deputy Kenny, in that there is a fundamental public policy question about whether we want services to be allocated based on people's ability to access the law or administrative practice based on laws passed by the Oireachtas.  This is a fundamental question which goes way beyond our discussions this morning but it is absolutely central to how one manages areas such as this which are contested.  Many areas in public policy are contested.  People have rights and can seek to have those rights vindicated in the courts.

I will ask a number of quick questions.  I have read Mr. Watt's opening statement, in which he takes up this whole issue of his correspondence with RT&Eacute; after the programme aired.  What contact did the Department of Health have with the investigation unit of RT&Eacute;, and with Ms Dee Forbes, in advance of this programme going to air?  Mr. Watt's opening statement has five or six bullet points that absolutely refute what was aired and shown to the whole nation.  It seems incredible that these points were not all put to RT&Eacute; before the programme actually went to air, however.<\/p> <p>  I will bundle my questions together if that is okay.  Obviously, 29 court cases are pending but many more in a backlog have now been dealt with.  I am sure Mr. Watt has been overwhelmed by freedom of information, FOI, requests since this programme went to air.  On foot of this, do the Department's data protection or freedom of information officers have percentages as to what extent or how much of the files they had to redact when FOI data was issued to people?<\/p> <p>  Finally, when we bring all this down and get beyond the lofty levels of litigation and the Department of Health defending itself and setting out its stall, at the hub of it all we have children with special educational needs and their families.  As the final contributor today, I will conclude by speaking on this.  I was a teacher for 16 years before entering the D&aacute;il.  The fact remains that there are still many unmet needs for children and teenagers with special needs.<\/p> <p>  I ask that in taking on this role as Secretary General in the Department, Mr. Watt will look at one of the huge anomalies.  We have special educational needs organisers and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, on the Department of Health side.  There are many disparities and things not adding up.  The reality is that over the past 14 months of Covid-19, many of the supports laid on by the Department of Health, such as CAMHS, have not been fully up and running.  They have not met virtually.  They have not met the needs of children during this period.  That also needs to be looked it.  It is not all about litigation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2021050500002#N00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1620169200,"counter":350,"content":"<p>I agree absolutely with those sentiments.  That focus is to improve services.  As the Deputy said, there are many gaps.  The situation has been difficult for many people over the last 16 months or so, and particularly challenging for people in dealing with Covid-19 and all the restrictions.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy that the key point here is not about litigation or \"Prime Time Investigates\".  It is about the ability of the system to use and get more resources and to galvanise supports to help people.  That is absolutely the focus of the Department of Health.  Colleagues who are with me today spend much of their time and careers on these issues.  Their focus is to improve services.  That is definitely my motivation and that of my colleagues in the Department.  That is what we are about and it is the absolute priority of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the Taoiseach and the Government.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the other points mentioned by the Deputy, we had correspondence with RT&Eacute;.  I believe we have published the letters.  If we have not, we can make those available to the D&aacute;il.

Obviously, the information is personal in the main.  It is not given out generally.  Of course, regarding the later requests from the families or their representatives, as I mentioned earlier, the Department is doing all it can to assure the families in respect of the allegations that were made.
