Last night's news that the State was to be moved to level 5 from midnight tomorrow until the end of November was the source of this uncertainty and anxiety.  I understand fully that this was a hard decision for the Government.  I also know that it is an even harder decision for all those who will bear the inevitable brunt of the hardship it will bring.  It would be impossible today to overstate the level of concern and, in some cases, distress among our people.<\/p>  <p>  I fully accept that action had to be taken.  There is no doubt that the virus is being transmitted exponentially.  We now have six weeks to do the things I believe the Government should have done during the summer months, when we achieved a very low rate of transmission of Covid-19.  At that time, through collective action and personal sacrifice, we suppressed the virus and, with the right plan, I am absolutely confident we can do it again.  We must not, however, lose this second window of opportunity to build capacity and our defences for the time ahead.  We need to see a plan, therefore, to increase hospital bed capacity and for the rapid recruitment of staff.  We have to get testing and tracing right.  We need a plan to ensure a secure and affordable roof over our people's heads, and we need to get things right as regards people coming onto the island through our airports and ports.  It would be unthinkable if in six weeks we were to meet again not having responded to these challenges.  We need a strategy that brings us beyond 2020.  This must be an all-island strategy.<\/p>  <p>  I was taken aback by the Taoiseach's comments last night that seemed to suggest we will move in and out of lockdown for the duration of 2021.  I would like him to clarify that point for us.  A lot is being asked of people over the next six weeks.  The Government absolutely cannot sleepwalk its way through this lockdown.  Everything that needs to be done must be done to ensure we emerge stronger at every level.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has addressed his devastating cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and wage subsidy scheme.  As he knows, we were very concerned that he did not do so in last week's budget.  He now needs to make sure these payments do not leave anybody behind.  One group that is struggling and has been left behind is mortgage holders.  We argued very strongly that the mortgage payment breaks should have been extended for homeowners and businesses.  That was at the end of September, just three short weeks ago, yet the Government failed to secure these protections.  Now, three short weeks later, we are on the eve of a day when 200,000 will lose their jobs.  Does the Taoiseach now accept that this was a very grave error in judgment on the part of his Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance?  Does he accept that this failure will have very serious implications for the credit ratings of tens of thousands of families and businesses?  He could have done something about this but he failed to do so and that is shocking.  He cannot blame people for believing the cosy relationship between his partner in government, Fine Gael, and the world of high finance was a key reason the Government sat on its hands and allowed this to occur.<\/p> <p>Who will be calling in the banks?  Will the Taoiseach be in contact with them directly and will he make it clear to them that they must play ball in giving easement and breathing space to mortgage holders?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000003#A00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603199100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I accept that moving to level 5 creates a lot of anxiety, difficulties and challenges for people, particularly people in employment who will now lose their jobs and enterprises that have struggled through the pandemic and since reopening have been endeavouring through hard work and putting in place safe protocols to save their enterprises and keep them going which, to a large extent, many did.  To be hit with a move to level 5 is a huge blow to them.  That is accepted.  That is why it is a difficult decision to move to level 5.  I know from talking to all of the leaders over the past two weeks that all of them were of the view that moving to level 5 would be very difficult and that is the case.  However, protection of public health is paramount.  The virus thrives on congregation.  Where large crowds gather, the virus spreads.  That is the fundamental truth.  Therefore, we have to avoid large crowds gathering in any context and mixing and engaging.<\/p>  <p>  We are not proceeding with an elimination or zero-Covid strategy as a country.  We are also not proceeding with a herd immunity strategy.  This virus kills and it also damages people for the long term in that it can have long-term health implications.  The strategy to be followed is one of suppression.  Deputy McDonald mentioned that I held out the prospect last evening that we were in a cycle.  We are, but it is very much subject to human behaviour and all of us reducing congregation and gatherings of people in large numbers.  I am not saying that.  NPHET has said this to us.  I am being very candid with the Oireachtas.  I foresee periods of high level restrictions followed by low level restrictions and, if necessary, followed by high level restrictions again if the virus spreads during the reopening phase.  <\/p>  <p>  On testing capacity, we are testing far more people than we did in the first phase.  The Chief Medical Officer said on \"News at One\" that we are testing at an unprecedented rate right now.  The serial testing programmes are picking up a lot of cases, particularly in nursing homes and other locations, including in schools where up to 13,000 students and teachers have been tested and the positivity rate is around 3%.  It is important that we set as a societal objective and priority that we keep our schools going.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald spoke about people having a roof over their head.  We are allowing construction to continue because we have a homeless crisis, a housing crisis and we need to build homes.  We lost ground during the first lockdown.  The construction sector here took a bigger hit than was the case in any other country across Europe.  As a result of the lockdown, we are behind in terms of output and houses built.  Prior to the formation of the new Government, we were behind in meeting targets for 2020 because of the lockdown.  We must allow house construction to continue because of the crisis in homelessness, the lengthy social housing lists and housing need generally.  <\/p>  <p>  On the all-island approach, Deputy McDonald is well aware of the situation.  Her party is in government in the North and she realises more than anyone in this House the difficulties and sensitivities of endeavouring to reach an agreement within the North, never mind on an all-island basis.  I have been in touch with party leaders in the North.  Whether it will move to a higher level is a matter for the Northern Executive.  It has had challenges and difficulties in arriving at the decision it reached last week.<\/p>  <p>  On the banks, the Deputy knows well that the European Banking Authority co-ordinated a Europe-wide approach to mortgage breaks and loan repayment breaks in the context of the first lockdown, which was Europe-wide.  That was the context in which Government could do what it did on that occasion.  The Minister for Finance will be engaging with the banks on this issue.  Our entire approach has been to alleviate as much distress as possible, increasing and bringing in new tiers for the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme and the introduction in the budget of the new Covid restrictions subsidy scheme for companies that will be closed for longer periods as a result of this pandemic.<\/p> <p>All of our approach has been to try to help where we can to alleviate the stress and pressures on people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603199400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>The Taoiseach is right that the European Banking Authority did indeed oversee and supervise the regime for mortgage breaks.

We were very clear on where we thought the country needed to go, unlike some others.  In regard to what was announced, we are not going to magically wake up on 1 December and see what has been delivered.  We need metrics and measurements.  We need the Taoiseach to say to the public what we need to achieve, what will happen if we achieve the specified measurements in regard to the R-nought rate, hospitalisations and everything else and what will take us to level 3 and level 2.  It is about giving people hope, as the Taoiseach knows, in terms of Christmas and there on in.  We cannot always be going between levels 2 and 5.  I believe we are going to have to live with this virus and to move between one level up or one level down, but these massive changes cannot be sustained.  What do we need to do to ensure we get to levels 2 and 3?  Can the Government show metrics and measurements in this regard to the public?<\/p> <p>It is appreciable that the Government has taken on Senator Moynihan's proposal on bubbles, which she has been working on for some time.  However, I want clarity on the idea that we can allow individuals to come together.  There are 400,000 people living alone and the over 200,000 single parent families.  The details on the Government's website are way too restrictive on visiting for children under 18, mental health, custody arrangements, dementia and carers.  We have overcomplicated this.  I know the Government has made a couple of changes to what it announced already such as for funerals, with which I agree.  How can one measure whether somebody has a mental health challenge and that he or she should go into a bubble?  It is not measurable.  We need to make this very simple.  What is the difference between somebody going into a bubble because he or she needs to do so due to a mental health challenge and somebody going into a bubble because he or she is partaking in chemotherapy?  These people are both equally needy.  The Government should take a line from the television show \"The Cube\" and simplify it.  The Government is on the right track but it is a little bit too narrow and tight.  This needs to be simplified.  It is a very good concept, it has worked in New Zealand and Britain has adopted it as well.  It deals with the issues we all know the lonely and vulnerable faced in the first lockdown.  I ask the Government to look at simplifying this and allowing two people to come together for whatever reasons, rather than those reasons listed by the Government.  I also ask the Taoiseach to give us some measurements and metrics on what we can achieve through yesterday's announcements by 1 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000005#C01400","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603200000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments and support for the Government's decision.  On the metrics, NPHET has been clear that we have to get consistently below R=1.  Ideally NPHET would want us to get it to 0.5, although it would be very challenging to do so in six weeks.  There are other measures that we need to get consistently going on a downward trajectory.  Other factors would have to be considered as well, as is the situation within the plan.  Those are the broad metrics, particularly getting the R number well below 1 and getting the trajectory going downwards.  That depends on all of us working and adhering to the regulations and guidelines.  It is extremely important that we do that because the reward for that is to get shops open on 1 December, get people out again and get back to level 3.  That would be my objective.  Level 3 is a controlling level, if properly enforced and adhered to.  I am not holding up prospects beyond that.  It depends on the progress we make against this virus over the next six weeks.  Nonetheless, that is what is ahead of us.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the proposal that Senator Moynihan put forward.  The co-leader of the Social Democrats, Deputy Shortall, also raised this issue at our meeting last week, namely the concept of a support bubble and we have taken that on board.  We have to be careful about this.  Care exemptions are already available outside of the concept of the support bubble and they were always available in the context of the household rules and regulations.  Beyond the care regulations, there is the situation of someone who is living alone.  The overriding objective is to prevent social isolation and to enable people to have an exclusive bubble or connection with another household.  I take the Deputy's point and I also want to keep it simple.  I do not want to complicate it any more either.  The public health officials are nervous that people may exploit this measure but that will not happen.  It is a valuable addition and it is an example of learning from the first phase of the lockdown.  It is an example of trying to take lessons and apply them to how we behave.<\/p>  <p>  We will be dealing with the impact of this for the next 12 months, even if we get the vaccine before the end of the year.<\/p> <p>Today the Government signed up for two more advance procurement deals with the EU and two other companies.

We have 200 fewer full-time nurses in the HSE than we did in December, which is incredible.  How in the name of God did that happen?  We have 1,800 temporary contract nurses more than we had.  I am following what the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is saying about the number of healthcare workers he will bring in, which is 1,600 by the end of next year.  I remind the Taoiseach of the figures of 8,500 by the end of this year and 12,500 by the end of the winter plan in April.  Nobody watching these proceedings and no one here believes that is achievable, given the track record I have just outlined, so what will the Taoiseach change to ensure we can get more permanent nurses, who are so badly needed, into the system?  Will he once and for all ensure that the exploitation of student nurses ends now?  It is utterly wrong.  For his information, on the HSE website, as of an hour ago, there were 70 advertisements for nursing, three of them in the community care area and only two for more than one nurse in any setting, so it does not look in any way as if there is any hope of achieving those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000007#E00200","speaker":"1610"},{"type":"speech","time":1603200300,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I will engage with Deputy Kelly, the Minister for Health and others on Deputy Kelly's ideas about the bubble and with other Members of the House on how it can be, in the Deputy's words, simplified, particularly in respect of subsequent adherence and enforcement.

It is really regrettable that he did not take up that proposal because we found ourselves yesterday in a situation in which a momentous decision was taken yet there was no consultation whatsoever with Opposition parties or party leaders, no sharing of data and no sharing of the modelling.  That is really regrettable, and I think the response has been all the weaker for it.  I repeat that request, that the Taoiseach consider such an approach, because over the next six weeks not only do we all have to work together to drive down the virus but we must also use that time to devise a coherent strategy in order that we do not have a third lockdown in January.  That coherent strategy has to include proper testing and tracing, an all-island approach, testing at airports and, fundamentally, it has to entail all of us working together.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider now some actions he might take, that is, to broaden the decision-making around all these issues to include a wider perspective and to consider doing so now in order to improve the balance of all the issues being taken into consideration and improve the prospect of success.<\/p> <p>When one considers, for example, the all-day deliberations last Saturday, they were quite narrowly focused both in terms of the nine or ten principals involved in that decision-making, all being male and lacking a more balanced perspective, and also that the grouping was very much focused on the health perspective but also the mathematical modelling involved.   While the figures are critical to this, there is also the issue of human nature.  I am not aware of anybody with any kind of expertise in behavioural psychology being involved in any of the decision-making around this.<\/p> <p> Two areas have shown the lack of balanced decision-making.  The first is with regard to the proposal on having no visitors in homes.  A large number of people of all age groups live alone.  It is unreasonable to say to those people that they cannot have a single visitor to their homes.  There are exempted categories but let us take as an example a 25-year-old or 30-year-old living on his or her own and possibly working from home.  The Taoiseach is saying to such people that they cannot have a friend, boyfriend or girlfriend in to visit.  That is completely unreasonable.  The Government needs to revisit that and consider the wisdom of it because it does not take account of human behaviour.<\/p> <p> The second area is related to vulnerable workers in nursing homes and meat factories, which is highly precarious employment.  It is human nature that if someone is not covered by sick leave entitlement, he or she will go to work.  We will, therefore, have a repeat of what happened earlier in the year when we had disasters in both those settings.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider those two issues?  They are not reasonable and do not take account of human behaviour.  They need amendment in all reasonableness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000007#E00600","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603200600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her comments.

Mr. Paul Reid was there as CEO of the HSE.  That briefing happened only last Monday week.  I then spoke to party leaders later in the week, including Deputy Shortall's co-leader, Deputy Catherine Murphy.  I spoke to Deputy McDonald about the situation in Northern Ireland and the move in Northern Ireland to the equivalent of our level 3.  I spoke to the First Minister, the deputy First Minister and the leader of the SDLP - I did not get to speak to other leaders in the North - to see if we can get as close to a harmonisation of positions as we could, notwithstanding the different political sensitivities and realities and the two different jurisdictions.  We must be a bit real about this.  The word \"glibly\" is thrown around the House about an all-island response but we must recognise realities.  I am not on the Northern Executive.  The Northern Executive had its own challenges last week trying to get agreement.

It called for level 5 measures across the country for four weeks.  The Government rejected that advice.<\/p> <p>What is more, the T&aacute;naiste went on RT&Eacute;, channelled his inner Donald Trump and publicly trashed and undermined the public health advice.  Two weeks ago, in the Chamber, I warned this approach would not avoid going to level 5 and that it would simply mean going to level 5 later and for longer, after lives had been lost in nursing homes and in the community.  That is precisely where we are now.  When NPHET wrote to the Taoiseach two weeks ago, there had been 3,000 cases in the previous week.  Now, the figure is more than 7,500.  Then, there was a 14-day incidence rate of 108 per 100,000; now it is 262.  Then there were 31 outbreaks in nursing homes; now there are almost 200.  Now, because the Taoiseach did not follow the public health advice, we have a six-week lockdown instead of a lockdown for four weeks.  The economy will suffer more damage as a result of this decision.  Mental health will be more affected.  Women and children facing abusive situations are more at risk.  More people will die.  Will the Taoiseach admit he made a grave mistake two weeks ago?  Will he apologise for that mistake?<\/p> <p> The future the Taoiseach has outlined today, what he has to offer people, is a lockdown for six weeks followed by partial reopening followed by a lockdown, again and again, disrupting our lives until a vaccine is found in a year or two.  What if a vaccine is never found?  That is an appalling vista for people.  The Government squandered the sacrifices people made in the summer and failed to take the opportunity then to crush Covid.  That mistake must not be repeated.  This is why we need a zero-Covid strategy.  Despite the Taoiseach's scaremongering in his speech last night, this does not mean locking down until there are no cases.  It is about achieving zero community transmission.  It means being able to trace immediately any outbreaks that happen.<\/p> <p> The WHO has made clear that lockdowns are simply a way to buy time to put in place measures to prevent further outbreaks.  These measures now need to be put into place.  They include world-class find, test, trace and isolate support infrastructure to hunt down the virus and building a national health service, not by renting private hospitals at extortionate cost but by bringing them into public ownership and incorporating them into our public health service.  It means providing people with the support they need to protect others from becoming infected, proper sick pay, a fully restored pandemic unemployment payment and an evictions ban that does not lapse in December promising a wave of Christmas evictions.  It means directing the banks to reinstate mortgage moratoriums for people.<\/p> <p> Will the Taoiseach apologise for the mistake he made two weeks ago?  Does he agree that we cannot repeat the mistakes of the summer and we have to embrace a zero-Covid strategy so this lockdown is the last one that people have to endure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000009#G01300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603201800,"counter":57,"content":"<p>The Deputy spoke about what happened two weeks ago, which was on a Sunday.  The previous Thursday evening, the Government received a letter from the same body, NPHET, that did not even recommend moving from level 2 to level 3.  These are the facts.  This is the prelude to what happened on the Sunday.  Suffice it to say, the letter on Sunday took the Government by surprise, and everybody in the House bar the Deputy and Deputy Boyd Barrett.  They were the two Deputies who wanted to move to level 5 at that stage, whereas nobody else did because of the enormous impact it would have on people.<\/p>  <p>  This is not an exact science and let us not pretend that it is.  What we have not quantified yet is the human cost of lockdowns, if we are honest.  We are getting evidence on the damage to children who are out of school for too long, in terms of regression and life chances, particularly for disadvantaged children who may leave school early.  This is hard to calculate.  We have yet to quantify and do proper research on delayed diagnoses resulting from a large number of people not using our hospitals during the first lockdown for non-Covid illnesses.  Deputy Kelly has been raising this for quite some time.  In other words, these are cancer patients, heart patients and people with a range of diagnoses who just said they would not go to hospital and delayed.  Many consultants and clinicians are worried about delayed diagnoses.  This is not an exact science.<\/p>  <p>  What the Government did in response to NPHET's letter was to move immediately to level 3.  Level 3 is a very severe form of restrictions.  It essentially closes down our entire hospitality sector, including pubs, restaurants and hotels, bar a few exceptional provisions.<\/p> <p>In the context of the European stringency index, before we made our announcement last evening, Ireland was number one in terms of the level of restrictions.  That was because we moved to level 3 two weeks ago.  We added to that with the single-household provision and further restrictions in Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan.<\/p> <p> The Deputy said I held up an appalling vista.  I do not agree with him on zero Covid and NPHET does not either.  The Deputy clearly rejects NPHET's advice on zero Covid but it has been very clear to us that it does not believe that the zero-Covid approach is credible, doable or implementable.  The Deputy should not underestimate the impact on human lives, as well as the cost to people, that would result from such a measure.  This is not an exact science; it is difficult and challenging and one has to balance a whole range of considerations.  It needs to be given deep consideration.  It cannot be the case anymore that we move from one level to another on one night on receipt of a letter.  The day is over where someone gets a letter on day one and we do something by midnight.  There has to be some degree of consideration and other inputs.  I agreed with Deputy Shortall earlier - I did not get a chance to reply - when she spoke about bringing in a broader range of people.  There are 40 individuals on NPHET but we need other Departments to have an input.<\/p> <p> Child welfare referral rates decreased sharply during the lockdown, and that is a danger.  Domestic violence increased significantly during the lockdown.  That is also an issue.  These are all issues that cannot be dismissed.  As we go through this pandemic, we will learn more and, hopefully, be able to refine how we do things.  NPHET informed us on Saturday that if we work with this for six weeks, we can get to a position, hopefully by the beginning of December, where we can reopen but that, in the new year, we might have to consider more restrictions again to keep control of the virus until we get hold of a vaccine . NPHET believes that is a better and more credible pathway than the zero-Covid or herd immunity pathways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000010#H00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603202100,"counter":59,"content":"<p>We have heard about the Thursday letter, level 3 and so on before.  I will quote from the letter of 4 October.  It states: \"A graduated approach would, ultimately, result in application of Level 5 measures as mitigation.\"  NPHET predicted precisely where we are.  It is important, to learn lessons for the future, that the Government acknowledge that the advice to move to level 5, two and a bit weeks ago, was correct and that it made a serious mistake by refusing to follow it.  I do not care what other parties in this House advocated; NPHET was clear.  It has been vindicated and the Government damaged the public health advice in general by taking the approach it did.<\/p>  <p>  Judging by the way the Taoiseach talks about the matter, it is as if those who advocate a zero-Covid approach are pro-lockdown.  We are not pro-lockdown.  Everybody, surely, is anti-lockdown.  Nobody wants to be in a lockdown, but we are going into a lockdown on Wednesday night with the Government's strategy of supposed suppression and managing the virus, which offers a continual yo-yo, into lockdown, out of lockdown, into lockdown, out of lockdown.  That is a nightmare for people.<\/p>  <p>  The alternative, zero Covid, can be achieved.

The NESC is a valuable forum where strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic social, environmental and sustainable development can be analysed and discussed between a variety of actors and Departments.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the council focuses on the strategic and longer-term view.  It recently agreed a new work programme comprising the following core areas of work: shared island; housing; sustainable development, climate and biodiversity action; good jobs and resilience in transitions; elder care; and galvanising vision.  In addition, to date in 2020 and in response to the Covid-19 crisis the NESC secretariat has published seven working papers on Covid-19 across a range of issues, including the implications of Covid-19 on housing in Ireland, protecting enterprises, employment and incomes and progressing sustainability in the context of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 I have certain functions regarding NESC, such as presenting reports to Government prior to publication or laying them before the Houses, as in the case of the annual reports.  The council is funded through my Department's Vote and my Department also has governance responsibilities in respect of the council.<\/p>  <p>  I appoint members to the council under the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 and SI 603 of 2010.  Each of the following sectors nominate three representatives to the council: business and employer interests, ICTU, farming and agricultural interests, community and voluntary sector and the environmental sector.  There are also seven independent members on the council.  A further six members are public servants, mainly Secretaries General, and this group must include a representative of my Department and the Department of Finance.  The Secretary General of my Department is the chairperson of the council and an assistant secretary of my Department is the deputy chairperson.  Since becoming Taoiseach I have made one appointment to the council.<\/p>  <p>  The National Economic and Social Development Office is the body corporate for the NESC.  Section 13 of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006 provides that the chairperson and deputy chairperson of NESC are members of the NESDO.  The National Statistics Board was established under the Statistics Act 1993 to guide the broad strategic direction of the Central Statistics Office and in particular to establish priorities for the development of official statistics in Ireland.  The legislation provides that the NSB shall consist of eight members, including an assistant secretary or equivalent or higher grade from my Department and the Department of Finance and the Director General of the CSO.  In August I made one new appointment to the NSB.  Three other members were reappointed for second terms.<\/p>  <p>  All appointments to NESC and the NSB have been made in line with the relevant legislative provisions and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to state boards.  Finally, one principal officer in my Department has been nominated to the council of Gasice.  These appointments are made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000019#R02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1603206600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, is hosting the annual conference of the European Environment and Sustainable Development Advisory Councils Network next week.  NESC published an important paper earlier this year that addressed employment vulnerability as part of a just transition in Ireland.  The paper recommended that Government take steps to improve the evidence base for policymakers and that future efforts to gather evidence to inform policymaking for a just transition should involve a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques to ensure data findings are amplified by first-hand expertise from businesses and communities.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could provide us with an update on the Government's implementation of these recommendations and where these measures are placed in the climate action and low carbon development (amendment) Bill, which was published earlier this month.  The Bill does not make reference to a just transition, nor did the Government make mention of fairness when launching this legislation.  My colleagues, Senator Boylan and Deputy O'Rourke, have already expressed concerns at the omission of any mention of a just transition, workers' rights or social justice in the Government's climate Bill.<\/p>  <p>  As political leaders, we need to meet people where they are and bring them where they need to be on matters of such island-wide and global importance.  Deputy O'Rourke has highlighted the absence of workers' rights or social justice expertise on the Climate Change Advisory Council.  I ask the Taoiseach to address this omission.  Solutions to the climate crisis can create an income crisis for workers and their families.  As a result, climate action is all too often unnecessarily framed in a negative context.  Inequality is central to this.  Where agriculture is placed within the climate action discussion is an example of how the Government is getting this wrong.  The Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and others have highlighted how unequal the agricultural sector is in terms of income.  Farmers, like those in other sectors affected by the changes we need to make, need to know that fairness and climate action can and will go hand in hand.  The Government's climate legislation needs to incorporate solid evidence-based data, amplify expertise from businesses and communities as recommended by NESC, and place a just transition, workers' rights and social justice centre stage.  I would be grateful if the Taoiseach would share his point of view on these matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000020#S00100","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1603206600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The work programme of NESC does not cover any issues around the educational system, which is a glaring omission as far as I am concerned.  We all know the Minister for Education and Skills also does not sit at the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19.  To make progress, economically and socially, we need to manage and monitor all our developments in education and how they will interact.<\/p>  <p>  I will raise with the Taoiseach an issue that has become topical as a result of what schools have been saying in recent times.  We will have to bring in rapid testing across economic and social settings.  I will raise this matter in the House every week because I do not have the capacity to understand why this testing is taking so long to introduce in this country.  We have a 250-page report on this.  Rapid testing is not a silver bullet but it will complement polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing and help in schools, many economic settings such as factories and various social settings.  Why is it taking so long?  It will have a massive impact and would give some help in educational settings, whether third-level education or in schools.  While it has not come through the regulatory validation process, the Taoiseach is aware that a secondary school in Cork city is using rapid testing all of the time.  What is his opinion on that given that it is outside the regulatory setting?  I understand the reason it is happening.  It is because people are so frustrated.  There are so many organisations that want to do this.  We are allowing the GAA championships to go ahead, and I agree with that decision.

One of the conclusions it drew is that Covid-19 has made good jobs better and poor jobs worse.  That is an extremely interesting conclusion and the paper featured a fascinating graph, which I would be interested to know if the Taoiseach has seen.  The graph shows that the people least impacted by Covid-19 tend to be the best paid people with the best ability to work remotely and so on.  They are also less economically affected.  The worst impacted and least remunerated are the people we have depended on most.<\/p>  <p>  There is a great deal to be said about this and how we have failed to reward those who have carried and will carry us through the restrictions.  One of the most damning examples is that of healthcare workers.  They are subject to the highest risk and many of them are among the lowest rewarded.  A shocking example of this, although there are multiple examples, was the case of nurses who applied under the Be On Call for Ireland campaign being put on agency contracts, to which unfair dismissal protections and sick pay do not apply.  As I revealed last week, contact tracers were placed on zero-hour contracts.  A few hours after I exposed this, we were told that it was a mistake, even though it was all over their contracts.  Even if it was a mistake, which it was not, unfair dismissal protections and sick pay do not apply to contact tracing workers.  It is no wonder we do not have the contact tracers to get on top of the virus.<\/p>  <p>  Another egregious example is that of student nurses, who because of protest, were given healthcare assistant pay in March and April but who are working for nothing again.  Thousands of student nurses who are effectively working as nurses and care assistants are not getting a red cent.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, suggests that, such is the exploitation of this group of student nurses, the HSE does not bother to directly recruit permanent healthcare assistants, which we desperately need.  It can rely on the slave student nurses who also cannot do other work to boost their incomes because Covid-19 restrictions would mean they would be carrying infections into the hospitals, which they are effectively holding together in many cases while getting nothing.<\/p>  <p>  This is unacceptable.  This is fighting Covid-19 on the cheap, which will not succeed.  This is a big part of the reason we are in this mess, with the levels of infections we have.  We have not directly recruited for proper jobs in the HSE.  The nurses, healthcare assistants and other healthcare workers who are most at threat from Covid-19 are getting little financially and, in some cases, nothing.  Is the Government going to do something about this?  Will it make sure these student nurses are paid and rewarded?  Will it deal with the issue of proper recruitment to quality jobs for the front-line workers on whom we depend?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000020#S00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1603206600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I will ask about youth unemployment and training.

As for the just transition, we moved in respect of the midlands.  The Government provided &euro;20 million for the first retrofit scheme, with quite a number of counties affected by the decisions relating to the peat-burning stations.  That is one part of the pre-emptive moves that were identified in the NESC report to create alternative enterprises and employment in areas affected by climate change decisions that would have a detrimental impact on employment in a given area.  In addition, the carbon fund that has been created from the proceeds of the carbon tax will provide fuel subsidies.

The T&aacute;naiste is quoted in the papers this morning as saying the lockdown will cost 150,000 jobs.  I do not know how many mortgage holders are in that cohort but I imagine quite a lot as well as many more who will have their incomes negatively affected while still holding onto their jobs.  During the first lockdown, a six-month mortgage moratorium was put in place.  What will be put in place in the course of this lockdown?  Of course, the answer is not entirely in the Government's hands because with the privatisation of the banks, it cannot control what it does not own.  The Government is, however, in a strong position to put the banks under serious pressure to provide for a proper mortgage moratorium in this situation.<\/p>  <p>  On Leaders' Questions earlier, the Taoiseach indicated that the Minister for Finance will call the banks in.  I would have thought they would have been called in today.  I am surprised they have not.  I wonder why they have not been called in.  If they are not coming in today, when will they come in?  Will it be tomorrow, Thursday or Friday?  Surely to God it will happen this week.  Huge numbers of mortgage holders are anxious and are looking at this question very carefully at the moment.  What will the Taoiseach ask for?  What will be his ask when he goes to meet the banks?  What is he saying should be done in terms of, first, the duration of a moratorium and, second, this moratorium not being one whereby people are forced to pay interest, making money for the banks in a pandemic.  The moratorium should be interest-free.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000021#T01200","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1603207200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>When the residential tenancies legislation went through the Seanad last July, we proposed a very clear enabling amendment that the Government and the Minister opposed.  It would have possibly avoided the need for us to sit this week because it gave power to the Minister to reintroduce a ban on evictions.  It was an either-or.  It did not force him; it just gave him the power to do so if there was a second wave.  In fairness, some of the Taoiseach's colleagues in government in the Green Party supported the amendment or at least did not oppose it.  Now we have to deal with another rushed piece of legislation this week.  We learn from our lessons.  We call on the Taoiseach to extend the ban on evictions up to at least March.  It is important that it goes to March.  We cannot have a situation whereby it goes to just the first week in December because in that scenario people will have no certainty over Christmas, and surely this year of all years we have to ensure certainty.<\/p>  <p>  I have been through the issue of rent and a rent freeze many times.  I know what the capacity of the Government is on this.  I know it has extensive powers.  I ask the Taoiseach to use those powers.

It is absolutely unacceptable that the people who will be hit hardest by the lockdown in economic terms, losing either income or employment, will then also potentially have some of the banks crawling all over their backs, adding to the pressure and stress they face.  When people talk about protecting mental health, let us be clear what that means in many cases.  Often mental health is about the stress of not being able to pay one's mortgage, rent or bills and the uncertainty of possibly losing one's home.  There is nothing that will damage one's mental health more than that.  If we are all in it together, the Taoiseach has to act with might and main to ensure that the banks do not crawl all over people's backs or load up debts during the coming period.  If we can bring in emergency legislation to bail out banks, as we did a few years ago, we can bring in emergency legislation or do whatever is necessary in order to tell the banks they will not load up debt or harass people during possibly one of the most difficult periods in their lives.  The Government has to do this; otherwise, it will wreck the sense of social solidarity we need.  Similarly, simply reimposing the ban on evictions during level 5 restrictions is not good enough because it will mean that notices to quit can be issued and then, four or five weeks before Christmas, there will be a slew of evictions.

Let us not pretend there is not.  The ban came in during lockdown because a lockdown restricts movement.  It gives a basis to prevent evictions because of the constraint on people's movement and then the danger of becoming homeless if evicted and so on.  The Minister, therefore, will bring in legislation that will be effective from the duration of this lockdown and this level - that is, level 5 - which will prevent any evictions in that context.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the Minister also introduced the earlier legislation that was referred to, namely, the Residential Tenancies and Valuation Act 2020, which came into effect on 1 August.  That also protects tenants against experiencing rent arrears and who are affected by Covid-19.  It also protects them from eviction and applies nationwide, of course, subject to the tenant making an appropriate declaration.  It is my understanding that is there until 11 January and can be reactivated or kept going.  The Minister will, however, bring measures before the House to prevent evictions in the context of level 5.  His legislative solution will enable automatic application of the law if we move from a particular level to another where restrictions are brought in that restrict the movement of an individual as level 5 does with the 5 km rule.<\/p>  <p>  In and around the rent freeze, rent control measures are already in place, some of which, if I recall, the Deputy introduced originally.  They are still in place in terms of the rent control zones but, again, in terms of the legislation the Minister introduced earlier this year, the capacity exists to protect tenants under that Act.  As I said, there will be engagement with the banks on this.  They are obliged to deal with the codes and the Central Bank has a role in that.

A structure comprising ten Cabinet committees with specific responsibility for a range of issues has been established to support the achievement of these objectives.  These committees deal with the following matters: Government response to Covid-19; economic recovery and investment; housing; health; environment and climate change; social affairs and equality; education; Europe; Brexit and Northern Ireland; and Government co-ordination.  Cabinet committees meet regularly, consistent with the provisions in the programme for Government, and further committees will be established by the Government if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  A range of social and economic issues which impact on programme for Government commitments and which cut across many Departments have been considered and progressed through the Cabinet committee on the Government response to Covid-19, leading to the development of Ireland's national plan in response to Covid-19, the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business and Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19, which was launched recently.  Issues considered in each of these plans include the social and societal impacts, employee impacts and business continuity, supports for individuals and businesses, economic and budgetary implications, modelling, communications and international response measures.<\/p> <p>Other programme for Government commitments that have been progressed in the past four months or so include ongoing monitoring and management of the impact of Covid-19 on the provision of both Covid and non-Covid healthcare to ensure sufficient capacity, utilise new technologies, support vulnerable groups and develop new pathways of care.  The HSE's winter plan for this year, supported by the allocation of an additional &euro;600 million, will deliver essential healthcare in a Covid-19 environment while advancing the goals of Sl&aacute;intecare through prioritisation of primary care and community services.<br\/><br\/>The 24th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was held in Dublin Castle on 31 July.  It provided the new Irish Government and the restored Northern Ireland Executive to meet formally for the first time and exchange views on a wide range of issues of mutual interest and concern, including Covid-19 and Brexit.  A shared island unit has been established in my Department and its work is underway.  Budget 2021 included a shared island fund with a planned &euro;500 million to be made available out to 2025.  This fund will provide the resources to deliver on our commitment to build a shared island underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  The fund will foster new investment and development opportunities on a North-South basis and support the delivery of key cross-Border infrastructure initiatives set out in the programme for Government.<br\/><br\/>The July jobs stimulus was launched that month and comprises more than 50 measures and includes in excess of &euro;4 billion of direct expenditure, &euro;1 billion of taxation measures to directly support businesses, as well as &euro;2 billion in credit guarantees.  A unit to help co-ordinate future social dialogue has been established within my Department.  This unit will seek to create new models of sectoral engagement with a wide range of stakeholders across civil society.  It is part of the economic division of my Department which is already involved in dialogue with the social partners.<br\/><br\/>A number of key climate action commitments have been achieved including the publication on 7 October of the draft text for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2020, which will set the country on course to become climate-neutral by 2050.

A &euro;121 million budget package has been announced to provide additional funding to Tusla, for direct provision services, for youth and childcare services and for Traveller and Roma initiatives.  A suite of support measures has been announced for tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media, including a &euro;50 million support package for live entertainment and an additional &euro;50 million for the Arts Council.  There are ongoing negotiations at European Council level on the Multi-annual Financial Framework, MFF, the seven-year budget for the EU, and on the Next Generation EU recovery package.

He cited his concerns about child protection and domestic abuse and violence.  What additional supports and resources will be put in place for victims in terms of refuge places, additional resources and funding for support services to meet the demand over the next six weeks?  Will the Taoiseach set that out for us?  The Government needs to communicate very clearly to victims.  These are people who, in many instances, now live lives and daily routines of terror in these extraordinary and difficult times.  What resources are in place?  Staff working in these essential services need to know now that the funding and resources they require to meet the needs of these women, men and children are provided for.  I am running out of time but there is a commitment, for example, for a plan for future refuge space on publication of a review of domestic violence accommodation provision.  This needs to happen.

They want to know if the Taoiseach will state clearly that the removal of goods by KPMG from a retail outlet over the next six weeks would breach public health guidelines.  The Taoiseach needs to be explicit.

If there are particular issues she has identified with any specific refuges or centres that need additional funding, the Government will certainly respond.  The issue is that the evidence from the first lockdown was that the level of domestic violence did increase and that is a worry and a concern in the context of a further lockdown.  The Ministers concerned have been looking at what additional measures can be taken to help and to assist the staff involved, with awareness helplines but also engagement across the different Departments.  That work will continue and funding will not be an issue in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Even at today's Cabinet meeting, the level of work under way illustrates that the programme for Government is moving at pace.  The marine development Bill, which was before the Cabinet earlier, will help to unleash a lot of economic development.  It still needs a lot of legislation but the heads were essentially agreed today.  On housing, the Land Development Agency Bill was agreed today.  There is a lot of work still to be done but our aim is to get it published before the end of the year and through the House.  The electoral reform Bill dealing with the establishment of an electoral commission went through Cabinet today.  I refer to Erasmus for students in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding what may happen with Brexit.  If there is an agreement, UK students may be able to avail of the Erasmus programme.  If there is not, that will leave Irish citizens in the North in jeopardy.  We are taking measures to ensure students in the North can avail of the programme through universities in the Republic.  That was passed today.  We agreed Covid-19 measures to make sure we can sign up two other companies so we can procure vaccines when they become available.  We dealt also with the Covid-19 fines and penalties legislation and Cork flood support.  On direct provision reform, the report by Ms Catherine Day was considered by Cabinet today.  It is a very substantive report and the Ministers will launch it with her shortly.  The heads of the finance Bill was passed today.  A starting date for the CervicalCheck tribunal was sanctioned at Cabinet today.  Regarding victims and witnesses, the implementation of the O'Malley report on sexual violence went through Cabinet today and the Minister for Justice and Equality is acting on that.<\/p>  <p>  That is the level of pace and substance that this Government is about.  In the past four months, the quality and substance of the legislation has been without precedent, from what I can see, in such a short period.  The major issues we have dealt with economically, financially and in respect of health have been very substantial and we intend to continue with that pace.<\/p>  <p>  On Debenhams, I spoke to a shop steward this morning.  They are under a lot of pressure.<\/p> <p>The flooding that occurred in my city of Cork this morning created pressures for the workers concerned.  I will see what I can do regarding whether we can facilitate a meeting between KPMG and the shop stewards.  I know Mandate has been working on this and I do not want to overtake its role in it.

We discussed a wide range of pressing and strategic issues over the course of two days.  Our meeting opened on Thursday with a presentation by the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli.  He set out the Parliament&rsquo;s thinking on the European Union's seven-year budget and the next generation European Union recovery package, which was agreed to by the Council on 1 July.  I hope it will be possible to secure early agreement in the ongoing trilateral discussions involving the Parliament, the Council and the Commission so that these vital funds can begin to flow on schedule.  We then discussed Brexit, climate action and Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  On Friday morning, we discussed external relations issues, with the main focus on the European Union's strategic relationship with Africa.  We also considered Turkish maritime activity in the eastern Mediterranean, the situation in Belarus and the shooting-down of flight MH17.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will provide further detail on our discussions on external relations, while I will focus the remainder of my remarks on our discussions on Brexit, Covid-19 and climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Following President Sassoli's intervention, the European Council discussed the state of play in negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom.  As the House will be aware, we are entering the final and critical phase.  The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, shared his assessment of where matters stand, outlining where progress has been made during the talks and where more progress is needed.  He gave a comprehensive, succinct analysis of the circumstances pertaining to Brexit and outlined his overall desire, ultimately, to see an agreement between Britain and Europe.  He instanced peace in Ireland as one of his strong motivations in respect of the need for a constructive and sustainable future relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe and a good free trade agreement, noting that geopolitical circumstances in the world, as we move into the future, demand such an agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The period of transition will end on 31 December.  The European Council noted the progress on the key issues of interest to the Union and that it still was not sufficient for agreement to be achieved.  It was clear the European Council's determination remains to have as close as possible a partnership with the United Kingdom, as set out in our negotiating mandate and our previous guidelines, statements and declarations.  The key remaining issues in the negotiations include the level playing field, governance and fisheries.  I was joined by a number of other leaders in insisting on the importance of a fair and balanced outcome in respect of fisheries for our fishing enterprises and coastal communities.  I pointed out the degree to which quite a number of our coastal communities are very dependent on the fishing industry and the jobs that flow from it.<\/p>  <p>  There was agreement that fair competition, or a level playing field as it has become known, is essential for the protection of the Single Market and for jobs and industry throughout Europe.  We also agreed that any new agreement will need a robust, speedy and effective governance mechanism to resolve any disputes that may arise in the future.  The European Council invited Michel Barnier to continue negotiations in the coming weeks.  We also called on the United Kingdom to make the necessary moves to make agreement possible.<\/p>  <p>  Trust is an essential part of any negotiation, and there is no doubt that trust has been damaged by the UK Government's tabling of its Internal Market Bill, elements of which contravene the commitments the UK entered into as part of the withdrawal agreement.  The European Council recalled that the withdrawal agreement and its protocols must be implemented in a full and timely way, a point I made strongly in my intervention.  Given that not much time remains if agreement is to be secured, the European Council also called on member states, the Union's institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness and readiness for all outcomes, including no deal.<\/p> <p>In particular, we asked the Commission to give timely consideration to unilateral and time-limited contingency measures that are in the EU&rsquo;s interest.  This is an important message that is of great relevance in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As the Government has said many times, Brexit means change in all scenarios.  I appreciate this has been a most difficult year for all businesses, especially SMEs.  Budget 2021 was designed to ensure that we are ready for all outcomes and I continue to urge all business people who operate in, with or through the United Kingdom to take the steps they need to ensure they are ready for 1 January 2020.  In that context, the Cabinet today approved omnibus legislation which covers all the various Departmental and sectoral interests for consideration by this House shortly so we will be ready for Brexit on 1 January.<br\/><br\/>The European Council said it would continue to take a close interest in the negotiations in the period ahead.  As the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, said following our discussion, we will continue to do our utmost to make an agreement with the United Kingdom possible.  Our desired outcome is a constructive and effective partnership with the United Kingdom and we will continue to work in unity and solidarity towards that goal.<br\/><br\/>The European Council had an orientation debate on climate action which we hope to return to in more detail in December.  In September, the European Commission adopted a communication on 2030 climate ambition and proposed an increased European Union economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990.  Our discussions revealed a good deal of agreement on the main issues.  I joined with leaders from ten other member states, namely, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, in support of increased EU ambition, including a target of at least 55% for 2030.  This would put us on a path towards a climate-neutral EU by 2050.  While not all member states currently support a 55% reduction target, there was agreement that for the EU to meet the objective of the climate-neutral EU by 2050 in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, the EU needs to increase its ambition for the coming decade and update its climate and energy policy framework.<br\/><br\/>We discussed the Commission's proposal and the actions required to achieve that ambition.  There was agreement that the updated target will need to be delivered collectively by the European Union in the most cost-effective manner possible.  All member states will participate in the effort, taking into account national circumstances and considerations of fairness and solidarity.  In the coming months, the Commission will consult member states to assess their specific situation and the expected impact at member state level.  Achieving at least a 55% reduction by 2030 will be challenging but it is right that the EU should lead on this issue and encourage collective action.  It is right for the planet now and for the safety and prosperity of future generations.  We will again discuss climate action at our meeting in December.  I hope we will reach agreement at that time on this more ambitious climate target for the EU and submit an updated nationally determined contribution on behalf of the EU to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, NFCCC.<br\/><br\/>At our previous meeting on 1 and 2 October, we agreed that we should hold regular discussions on Covid-19.  At our meeting last week, discussions reflected the fact that most member states, like Ireland, have seen their case numbers increase significantly in recent weeks.  We agreed that the current epidemiological situation is unprecedented and gives rise to very serious concern. As I said, on the stringency index, Ireland had at that stage the most severe national restrictions of any European member state.  The meeting was a sombre affair with Prime Minister after Prime Minister articulating the increasing numbers in their respective countries.  We welcomed the progress that has been achieved so far on the overall co-ordination at European level on Covid-19, including the recommendation on a co-ordinated approach to the restriction of free movement.  We called on the Council, the Commission and member states to continue the overall co-ordination effort based on the best available science, notably regarding quarantine regulations, the quarantine framework for travel, cross-border contact tracing and testing strategies.  There has been some debate in the House on antigen testing and various other forms of testing.  Our view is that we should get stronger co-ordination among public health authorities in different member states on the efficacy and clinical validation of different testing regimes in different states.  We also called for continued co-ordination regarding joint assessment of <font color=\"#212100\">testing <\/font>methods, mutual recognition <font color=\"#212100\">of <\/font>tests and the temporary restriction of non<font color=\"#212100\">-<\/font>essential travel.  <br\/><br\/>The European Council also welcomed work at EU level on the development and distribution of vaccines.  We reiterated the need for a robust authorisation and monitoring process, the building of vaccination capacity in the EU and fair and affordable access to vaccines.  We also called for further co-operation on this at global level. <br\/><br\/>At the European Council, I also engaged informally with many of my EU counterparts in the margins of the meetings, using the opportunity to promote Irish interests.  On Thursday, I had a bilateral meeting with President Macron of France.  Our discussions focused on negotiations with the UK, in particular our shared determination to secure a fair and balanced outcome on fish.  We also compared notes on the Covid-19 situation in France and Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Last week's meeting of the European Council considered a number of serious and important issues.  What was very apparent was that, as we face into each of these challenges, we need to continue to work closely and co-operatively together, as the EU 27, to ensure we have the solutions and supports we need to get through.  Whether on Brexit, Covid-19 or climate action, we need to work together, maintain unity and stand together.  As we have seen on Brexit, the strength and solidarity that comes with EU membership is of enormous value in confronting the challenges we face.

What happens in the next days and weeks will have a profound impact on the island of Ireland economically, socially and politically.<\/p>  <p>  On Thursday and Friday of last week, the European Council met to discuss, among other things, the status of the talks with the British Government as we fast approach the deadline for a workable, fair and, as the Taoiseach says, balanced deal.   While we know there is no good Brexit for the island of Ireland, we are also acutely aware that a crash or no-deal Brexit would be the worst-case scenario.  Unfortunately, the game-playing on the part of the Tory Government and Boris Johnson over the last number of weeks has disrupted talks and undermined the prospect of that deal.  Central to this game-playing has been the British Government's use of Ireland&rsquo;s future as a bargaining chip with EU negotiators in an attempt to get a favourable trade agreement.  The Tories' use of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, which, by their own proclamation, breaks international law, is a clear attack on the vital protections afforded to Ireland and, let it be remembered, agreed to by Mr. Johnson's Government as part of the withdrawal agreement which came into force on 1 February of this year.<\/p>  <p>  The approach and behaviour of the British Government have understandably eroded trust and confidence in its willingness to stick to its words and honour its agreements.  This causes an obvious problem in progressing talks in a constructive manner.  It is the main reason we have arrived at what increasingly feels like a crisis point.  It is right that EU leaders have placed the onus on the British Government to unblock negotiations and make moves that will re-establish good faith.  Mr. Johnson, as we saw, responded with more game-playing and grandstanding by taking to the megaphone once again and declaring that Britain would prepare for a crash outcome.  I think he described it as the Australian deal.  This coincided with Britain&rsquo;s chief negotiator, David Frost, withdrawing the invitation to Michel Barnier for further negotiations in London on Monday.<\/p> <p>In my view, that move was aggressive, unnecessary and unhelpful, to say the least.  It seems that Mr. Johnson sticks to the mantra that it will either be his way or no way at all.  That is not the attitude of a Prime Minister who is serious about reaching a trade agreement that is fair, sensible and balanced, not only for Ireland and the EU but also for the British economy.  A crash Brexit and the imposition of World Trade Organization rules would not be a good outcome for anyone.  I was therefore interested to hear the Taoiseach say that the Commission has been asked to prepare unilateral responses in the context of a no-deal scenario.  He said that is of particular interest to Ireland and I wonder if he will elaborate on that and set out what these unilateral actions are and how they might be favourable to Ireland.<\/p> <p> I hope that the discussions that took place by phone yesterday between British and EU negotiators might act as a catalyst for a more considered approach.  Hopefully, we will see the resumption of full negotiations later this week and, as I said previously, there is still time for the British Government to pull back from the brink, engage in good faith at this crucial time and respect international law and agreements into which it has entered.  The primary responsibility of the Irish Government at this juncture is to make it clear to Mr. Johnson that continuing to play a game of chicken using Ireland's protections and Irish interests is absolutely unacceptable.  It is, to my mind, abhorrent to dangle our all-island economy, the Good Friday Agreement, our peace and our peace process over a cliff edge in the hope that the EU will blink.  That approach will not work.  The days of British Governments bullying Ireland or anyone else into accepting their terms and demands are over, gone and are not coming back.  What needs to be reiterated at every opportunity by the Irish Government is that, regardless of the outcome of trade talks, it is absolutely essential that the withdrawal agreement is honoured and implemented.  While the agreement is far from perfect and does not solve all of our problems, the measures contained in the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol are the bare minimum required to protect Ireland.  They are our safety net and insurance policy against a hardened land border.  They provide protections for the Good Friday Agreement, our all-island economy and co-operation, North to South.  They cannot be compromised, diluted or bartered away because there is far too much at stake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000026#Z00200","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603210200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We are aware that the spectre of Brexit casts its shadow over all aspects of EU activity at the moment.  Regardless of whether or not an agreement is reached, the implications for Ireland are immense.  The potential immensity of the impact of Brexit is compounded by the fact that we may well be in the midst of the Donald Rumsfeld arena of unknown unknowns.  The scenario is exacerbated by Tory intent of deregulation across the marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  Just last week, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland warned of a disruption to the food supply chain, not just for Ireland, but for the wider European Continent, as a consequence of regulatory divergence following the introduction of Brexit.  This has enormous implications for food safety and businesses on this island.  The Tories are vehemently opposed to the introduction or application of regulatory food safety standards.  Attempts to date by farmers and campaigners in Britain to ensure that EU regulatory standards are replaced with a British equivalent have been defeated by Johnson's followers.  Ireland, along with other EU member states, must ensure that substandard food produce will not be allowed to enter the Single Market.<\/p>  <p>  The British regard EU food and animal health regulations as non-tariff barriers to trade and are seeking to have them removed.  This would allow substandard food produce, for example chlorinated chicken from the US, to enter the food supply chain of the Single Market through Britain.  This simply cannot be allowed to happen.  We need focused support for food-based industries in Ireland.  We also need to see focused engagement with food industry groups to help businesses understand and prepare for the real challenges ahead.  We need to prevent attempts by the Tories to remove non-tariff trade barriers which have been introduced over decades in order to protect our health and animal welfare.<\/p>  <p>  Another worrying instance of British deregulation is in the area of nuclear energy.  The decision by Britain to leave the European Atomic Energy Community as part of its Brexit strategy, despite concerns over its readiness to do so from its own nuclear regulatory body, is worrying.  There are real concerns regarding skill shortages in the areas necessary to establish a British regulatory system for both controlling nuclear material and meeting its international obligations.  The fact that the Tories cannot come up with the means to control the flow of traffic to Dover post Brexit raises real concerns over its ability to develop the necessary IT systems to track its nuclear material.  Previously, the British would have come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice where it could be held accountable for failure to adhere to recognised standards of safety, but not anymore.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, claims that the impact of a nuclear incident in Britain could cost Ireland as much as &euro;160 billion.  Even if there is no radioactive contamination in Ireland after such an incident, the lost revenue accrued as a result of reputational damage alone could run to as much as &euro;4 billion.  It is incumbent upon the Government to demand that the British Government introduces the strictest possible regulatory measures and that EU negotiators impress this upon the British in the strongest possible terms.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly turn to the issue of the Moria camp on Lesbos.  In response to much criticism of Government, some action was taken.  The Minister with responsibility for children, equality, disability, integration and youth, Deputy O'Gorman, received additional funding in the budget to bring over more unaccompanied minors.  I am surprised that was not a topic of conversation at the European Council meeting.  Despite numerous requests to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister with responsibility for children, equality, disability, integration and youth, Deputy O'Gorman, we have no details as to how that money will be spent and how many additional minors will be brought over.  The Taoiseach might touch on that matter in his concluding remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000027#AA00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1603210200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>Five-minute speaking slots for parties is not good enough for a Council meeting.  It runs counter to the agreement after the Lisbon treaty when we had a lot of debate about why people had lost faith in it and we wanted proper debate and scrutiny of European Council meetings.  I am all in favour of other Deputies being able to participate but it should not be achieved by trying to deal with a variety of important issues in five minutes.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to deal with anything other than the one issue that I want to focus on, which is Brexit, and that is a pity.<\/p>  <p>  During the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962, the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, sent two letters to President Kennedy.  The second letter countermanded the first.  The Americans decided, as a matter of strategy, simply to ignore the second letter, pretend it never arrived and proceed on the basis of the offer that was set out in the first letter.  The antics of the British Government seem to require the same response from Ireland and the European Union.  We should be determined to plough on with negotiations and ignore the background noise, however aggravating it might be.  The stakes for all of us are too high to do otherwise.<\/p>  <p>  The members of the House of Lords EU committee, with whom our Joint Committee on European Union Affairs will have an opportunity to speak tomorrow morning, prepared a report on the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill.  These are British parliamentarians who stated in their report that not only does the Bill contravene international law, but also \"strikes at the heart\" of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol and the withdrawal agreement.  That is certainly provocation.  Not unlike the appropriate response to the shocking antics that we are witnessing now in the final stages of the US presidential election, we must try to remain calm and focus on the prize of a decent trade deal with our nearest neighbour.<\/p> <p>We must continue to hope that behind the bluster is some recognition of the economic harm that a no deal or, to use the phrase Boris Johnson likes to use now, an Australian deal would mean for the Irish people, the British people and the people of the European Union.<\/p> <p> In truth, both sides know that two strong economic entities living side by side must, at some point, agree a mutually acceptable basis to trade.  The penny must have dropped that if that deal is not cut now, people will have to come around the table again in a few months or years, and the same issues will have to be addressed and resolved.  It seems to me that the so-called level playing field state aid issue, fisheries and oversight can all be dealt with. <\/p> <p> There seems to be a resistance in the United Kingdom to restrict state aid, but there is a state aid agreement in the UK-Japan trade agreement negotiated post-Brexit.  The UK is asking for level playing field provisions to be included in any future US-UK trade deal.  I do not understand the position.  Obviously, all trade deals require dealing with issues like that.<\/p> <p> I thought we had made progress on the issue of fisheries.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that there now seems to be a totemic linking of fisheries as somehow an emblem of national sovereignty.  Surely we can come to some terms.  As I heard the Vice-President of the European Parliament say to a British audience, one can catch all of those fish but does one intend to eat them all oneself or sell them somewhere?<\/p> <p> The issue of oversight must become even more important to us now if Britain says it can unilaterally tear up an international agreement.  We have to have some basis to ensure that, whatever is agreed, there is a process by which we can ensure that it is delivered upon.<\/p> <p> All of these matters are deliverable, in my judgment.  Maybe I am an optimist after all of my years in this House but at the end of the day, Boris Johnson may well do a Trump, accept the terms that are available and declare victory at the end.  Let him engage in that play-acting if that is the case.  As I said, the stakes for us are very high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000027#AA00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603210800,"counter":309,"content":"<p>The European Council meeting held last week dealt with a number of issues, including Covid-19, EU-UK relations and Brexit, climate change and external relations with Africa, as well as the southern neighbourhood, Belarus, Turkey and the downing of flight MH17.  Obviously of major concern to Ireland is the Brexit issue and the state of EU-UK negotiations on a possible trade agreement.<\/p>  <p>  The time, energy and resources given to dealing with the outcome of the fateful vote on Brexit way back on 23 June 2016 have been substantial.  Public administrations in every EU member state, including Ireland, as well as the European Commission, have grappled with this issue ever since.  This is such a shame.  Instead of dealing with the many other challenges facing the EU at this time, governments have spent endless hours trying to resolve the many problems arising from the UK vote.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council meeting last week was dominated by the Brexit question and it looks like it will be the same again for the next European Council meeting scheduled for 15 November.  Where are we now as regards the negotiations?  The UK wants to exchange legal texts and enter the so-called tunnel.  The Commission is obviously opposed to that, and rightly so. <\/p>  <p>  The UK Prime Minister has said he is now preparing to finally leave the EU without a trade deal.  I wonder about that.  There is no doubt that the UK Government is under pressure with regard to its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic at home.  One gets the impression that Prime Minister Johnson is hyping up anti-EU rhetoric for domestic political reasons to divert attention from the Covid-19 crisis, or perhaps it is simply a negotiating tactic.  Let us hope so.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, it is clear that a trade agreement is in the best interests of the EU, including Ireland, and the UK.  Irish agriculture, in particular the beef sector, will take a big hit should there be no free trade agreement.  Nevertheless, despite all of the rhetoric there are some signs that both sides are moving closer, if I am to listen to what the Taoiseach and others have said. <\/p>  <p>  The major issues to be resolved now centre on fisheries and access to UK waters by other EU states, historical access rights and quota shares, a level playing field, including environmental protection, labour rights and state aid standards, governance and how disputes will be resolved and whether the European Court of Justice will still have a role to play after 1 January 2021.  The reality is that the European Court of Justice will still have a role of some sort to play in respect of the various matters.  Disputes will arise, necessitating arbitration, but ultimately the European Court of Justice must interpret European Union law.  Compromise will be necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the news this week that some progress has been made on the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol.  Needless to say, there was a lot of unhappiness here and throughout the EU about the publication of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill.  As it happens, members of the House of Lords' European Union select committee are meeting the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs to discuss the Bill tomorrow.  The Bill gives the UK Government the power to break the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement.  Its publication highlights the lack of trust between the EU and the UK.  It raises the question of whether a trade deal, if agreed, would be adhered to, but that is a question for another day.  The Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol must be implemented to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process generally. <\/p>  <p>  If there is no deal in place by 1 January 2021, World Trade Organization rules will apply.  A no-deal Brexit would represent a monumental failure of statecraft on the part of the UK and the EU.  Tariffs will be imposed and there is no doubt that disruptive transport delays will occur almost immediately, especially at the Port of Dover.  The UK economy will take a hit.  What will happen then? <\/p>  <p>  To take up the point made by Deputy Howlin, the reality is that all of these issues will still have to be dealt with if there is no trade agreement.  It seems that matters arising from Brexit will still have to be resolved in the short, medium and long-term no matter what happens.  Brexit is not going away, and that is something we can all look forward to.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue discussed at the European Council summit meeting was Covid-19, as the Taoiseach outlined.  I welcome the conclusions of the meeting with regard to Covid-19.  It is generally accepted that the EU was initially very slow to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was a case of every member state for itself.  Then came a move towards agreement on the multi-annual financial framework and the associated recovery fund.  That is an unprecedented measure by the European Union whereby the Commission will, for the first time, borrow money.  I hope agreement can be reached with the relevant parties in respect of that recovery fund. <\/p>  <p>  I also welcome the progress made on vaccines.<\/p> <p>The Taoiseach informed the House earlier that the Government signed an agreement with the EU in respect of vaccines.  That is the way to go.  An EU approach to vaccines and what happens in respect of them is the right approach.  <\/p> <p> I also welcome the fact that the summit dealt substantially with relations between the EU and Africa.  The communiqu&eacute; states that the EU attaches high priority to strengthening its strategic relations with Africa and its partnership with the African Union, which remain based on mutual interest and shared responsibility.  The communiqu&eacute; goes on to talk about the issues of migration in the context of the African continent.  The continent is on our doorstep.  We in Europe are a developed continent and we have responsibilities towards our African neighbours.  The communiqu&eacute; states that the EU wishes to engage African partners in addressing mobility and all aspects of migration, including legal migration, combating illegal migration, readmission and the fight against militant smuggling networks both within and between the two continents.  All of us would welcome that.  The EU welcomes it as do the African countries themselves.  Migration is a major issue to be confronted at an EU level as well as a major global issue.  If we can stop migrants coming here in the first place on the basis of the economic development of Africa, then we will have done a good day&rsquo;s work.  <\/p> <p> All in all, the summit went well.  Brexit is the big issue and it is an ongoing saga.  We await to see what happens in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000028#BB00200","speaker":"1552","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603211400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>It is hard to believe that we are edging towards the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit and yet it is not the main talking point in either this House or the wider community.  Previously Members will recall that when a no-deal Brexit was arguably a vague concept, the previous Government had hosted information roadshows as part of an extensive PR exercise that also included engagement with businesses, communities and other affected sectors such as farmers.  Yet now, here we are with a no-deal scenario as a live prospect, which could be just weeks away, but it seems that we are more ill-prepared than ever.  There are no roadshows or extensive engagements and that, of course, is understandable considering that the Covid-19 pandemic has deflected attention.  We are rightly concentrated on tackling the virus and the challenges it has brought.<\/p>  <p>  Nobody should be under any illusions as to the dangers that we are now perilously close to with the absolute worst-case scenario right before our eyes.  It is in that context that we need clarity.  We need clarity on the Government's plans for all eventualities and on the EU supports that will be put in place.  Those plans and supports need to be set out very clearly at this stage on a sector by sector and region by region basis.  I come from the region that could be the most affected.  We know that for the agrifood sector and for other export-dominated sectors, particularly those that have a strong and dominant relationship with Britain, a no-deal Brexit could spell absolute disaster.  It is crucially important that the Government sets out its plans.<\/p>  <p>  One of the concerns I have regarding the information we have received from the Government is an implicit belief that the British Government will adhere to the withdrawal agreement even in the event of an no-deal Brexit.  I do not share that confidence.  The withdrawal agreement was reluctantly agreed to by the British Government to secure a pathway towards a trade deal.  If the British Government is to leave the EU without that trade deal and final settlement, I have no confidence, and history tells us that we should have no confidence, that it will adhere to its international obligations.  It is in that context that the plans need to be set out to involve and resolve all scenarios.  The plans must include the potential that we will need to have big constitutional discussions sooner than perhaps anybody would have believed was likely.  We cannot face the prospect that this small island on the edge of Europe is dealt a situation where we have two economies operating not only back to back but in conflict with each other in two very different economic and trade scenarios.  That would spell disaster for us and for our communities but also, in particular, for our peace process.  It is in that context that we need to be big enough, brave enough and bold enough to allow people to have their say as to what the constitutional future of this island should be.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000029#CC00200","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1603211400,"counter":312,"content":"<p>I agree with the comment of a number of other Deputies that if a deal is not concluded now, from January there will be a need for one to be concluded.  That aspect of this will not go away.  There is no question that in the long run we will fail to have a trade agreement in place, with the economic damage that this would cause to the UK, EU and Ireland.  There is no question but that it would be much better if a deal was put in place now.<\/p>  <p>  It is welcome that a discussion of legal treaty texts is to begin and there are reports that the talks will intensify.  It is also welcome that more than 70 British business groups have issued a statement effectively calling on their government to ensure that a deal is concluded and it is good to see that pressure coming from the UK.  If we look at what is happening in the US, there is some cause for hope that the presidential election may well show that the tide is going out on the brinksmanship, bluster and buffoonery that have been the hallmarks of the UK Government&rsquo;s approach to Brexit so far.  The path to a deal is emerging.  <\/p>  <p>  If a no-trade-deal Brexit was to go ahead, exports of Irish food products to the UK could decline by approximately one third, according to the London School of Economics.  Dairy exports from the EU to the UK could collapse by a staggering 94%.  There is a significant amount at stake, therefore, for Ireland and beyond.  It is essential that we support the sectors most affected, including our agrifood and dairy sectors.  It is also essential that in the event of a no-trade-deal that we support people affected in Ireland in low-income households who would be least able to deal with a sharp increase in imported food prices.  It is very important that that should be factored in.  It is estimated that the average cost of living in the event of a no-trade-deal Brexit could increase by as much as &euro;1,360 a year, which would impact significantly on low-income households.<\/p>  <p>  On climate action, it is very welcome that the Government is supporting the ambitious EU target for a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030.  It does not make any sense for us to do that at EU level if proper climate action targets are not tied into the trade deals that we agrees.  That applies to Brexit with regard to the level playing field but also applies to the EU Mercosur trade deal.  There are no sanctionable clauses within the EU-Mercosur trade deal treaty with regard to climate or environmental protections either for the Union or the South American countries.  Given the destruction that is taking place on an ongoing basis in the Amazon rainforests, in particular, and given that the trade deal could in fact accelerate that destruction if there are not environmental and climate change protections, it is essential, especially at the European Council meeting in December when the climate action provisions will be discussed, that Ireland takes a strong stance on that to ensure that there are strong climate sanctionable clauses and environmental protections in that trade deal and, indeed, in respect of Brexit.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, in standing up against the so-called LGBTI exclusion zones in Poland, and the work done by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, also.  In terms of the budget and the recovery fund, it is key that at a European Union level that there are changes to the rule of law.  We need to move away from the veto and move towards qualified majority voting, which is what the European Parliament has been pushing for.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to indicate if Ireland will support reforms on rule of law.  The stance they have taken on the so-called LGBTI exclusion zones is very welcome but for that to be meaningful we have to have changes in the way rule of law is dealt with at a European Union level, particularly in respect of the way funding is used.  I ask the Minister to address that issue when concluding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000029#CC00300","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603212000,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I begin by agreeing with Deputy O'Callaghan on the vital point of rule of law.<\/p>  <p>  The last time we spoke about the European Council we discussed the position regarding sanctions against Belarus.  It is extremely welcome that the Council has taken the decision not just to extend sanctions but, crucially, to include President Lukashenko in that sanctions regime.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the key areas touched upon by the Taoiseach, such as climate change but also the Union's response to Covid-19, are extremely important.  While it is an issue more relevant to the Minister for Health, what level of engagement is going on at General Affairs Council meetings among the 27 member states in terms of their approach to tackling this pandemic?  We are aware of what the European Union can and cannot do when it comes to health issues.  Many of the resources provided are extremely welcome.  We saw that yesterday with regard to the bond yields and also with regard to procurement and stockpiling but are there other lessons to be learned?  How do we compare to other countries?  What are the approaches being taken and what co-ordination can we expect in the coming months?<\/p>  <p>  I want to touch on the position relating to the EU-Africa discussions, which are vitally important to the future of the European Union.  It is an issue in which Ireland can and must play a leading role within the Union, not just because of our position in the world and the strategy of the Department of Foreign Affairs, DFA, to extend our diplomatic presence across the continent of Africa but also in terms of our strong history of mission work, NGO work, peacekeeping and so much more on that continent that will become increasingly important.<\/p>  <p>  Like other Deputies here I want to address the key issue dominating some conversations, although as Deputy Carthy rightly pointed out, it is no longer the biggest issue.  I refer to Brexit.  It is remarkable that over a two-day Council summit this issue, which is seen as the biggest issue whenever people think about the EU and the UK, but also here in Ireland, took up only about two and a half hours of the debate.  That is a signal to many that the European Union is ready to move on from Brexit and that Brexit is the mid-life crisis the United Kingdom is facing.  It is not of the EU's making and it is certainly not an issue that will hold back the EU or create division within the Union, despite what some people say.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome again the consistency in the repeated mandate from the European Council for Michel Barnier to make sure that a level playing field is at the heart of any agreement.  The standards of the European Single Market are vitally important and we cannot let a bargain basement trade deal undermine the standards of food, environmental protection and so much else across what is our Single Market.  It is not Ireland and the EU.  We are the EU and maintaining that integrity is vital.  We have to be aware of the political game-playing and rhetoric on display, which is tailored to a domestic audience enwrapped by ongoing crises when it comes to Covid-19.  We saw the scenes in Manchester today and how that will play out in Westminster.  I have no doubt there will be more chest beating, angry tweets and who knows what else.  It is shocking to see repeated references, including last Sunday morning and again yesterday afternoon, from British Ministers that they are prepared to leave with an Australian style free trade deal.  There is no such thing as an Australian style free trade deal.  The EU does not have an Australian style free trade deal.  It may as well be a Somali, Afghani or Islamic Republic of Mauritania deal.  It is important that the EU puts that aside and calls a no-deal what it is.  When people speak with such a level of entitlement to a Canada style deal that they say they are offered we should be frank and say that a Canada style deal was never sought by the UK.  A Canada style deal like the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, which I know caused some division in this House and when I was a Member of the Seanad, would have required an extension of the transition to allow a line-by-line tariff schedule take place.  CETA took nine years of negotiations.  We are trying to do in 11 months what the UK is now pretending they had always asked for and to which they were entitled.  Let us not forget that the Canada style deal comes with quotas and tariffs.  To the best of my knowledge there are no ro-ro ferries operating between Nova Scotia and Rosslare.<\/p>  <p>  I reject the issue Deputy Carthy raised in respect of preparation.  The in-person road shows are not taking place but the Minister addressed the exporters council this morning.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, addressed the issue yesterday.  I will be speaking to the august members of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown Chamber of Commerce next week about the importance of Brexit preparation in terms of industry.  It is not just a question of talking about it but seeing that the Government has backed this up with a &euro;3.4 billion Brexit support fund.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge for the Minister, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, is how we can best access any other EU supports that may be coming to Ireland or across the Union.  I mentioned the importance of yesterday's bond sales, particularly to the economies of Spain and Italy.  Moving on from the economic and public health impacts of Covid-19, we have to realise that the economical impacts of Brexit could be as bad as anything we have seen from Covid-19.  It is vitally important, therefore, that when Ireland seeks access to any European supports, Brexit is included as part of that. <\/p>  <p>  We also see that much more work needs to go on.  We see reports in England about the tailbacks in Dover.  Worryingly, we see the report from the Welsh Assembly last week on the issues that are likely to arise on 1 January 2021 in Holyhead, Pembroke and Fishguard, regardless of whether there is a deal.  There will be a requirement for customs checks.  That is the reason I welcome the announcement from the T&aacute;naiste of the &euro;9,000 customs grants to each business.<\/p>  <p>  This is excellent work.  It is important work but I fear, and it is an issue I raised with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs last week, that all of the work being done in Ireland may not be replicated in the UK.  In particular, I raised concerns relating to the work of Northern Ireland.  It is very welcome that Commissioner Sefcovic and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, had a warm meeting but much more needs to happen.  Tomorrow morning, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs will meet with the House of Lords European Union Committee.  We see the Internal Market Bill stuck in that parliament.  We saw a massive defeat for the British Government but we need to be given comprehensive, legally binding assurances that the Internal Market Bill will be heavily amended, if not withdrawn, and that the finance Bill due before the Houses of Parliament in the UK will not contain any measures that are detrimental to the agreed Irish protocol, which is an international agreement with responsibilities to international law.  We have heard the outcry from five living former British Prime Ministers and many more across the political spectrum in the UK, Brexiteer and remainer alike.  It is vitally important that it is upheld.  I underline the importance of the Government working with our European partners to make sure that those responsibilities are met.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000030#DD00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1603212000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The Minister of State may recall that in the previous Oireachtas the producer organisations and the inshore fishing representatives presented to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Their presentations were stark but one of the game-changers was the map I am holding, which clearly defines the exclusive economic zones.  Essentially, what is marked in red on the map are British fishing waters or British territory as they would see it which, like our own exclusive economic zone, are subject to the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p> <p>The warning signs were clear when Britain withdrew from the London Fisheries Convention a number of years ago on the grounds that its waters were to be used as a negotiating tactic in the trade negotiations.  The convention was signed in 1964.  After 1973, when the UK joined the EU, it secured a 26% increase in the allocation under what is called \"relative stability\" to reflect the development of the exclusive economic zones in 1976.  It was an increase of 26% above that of, and taken from, everybody else.  The Hague Preferences must also be considered in this regard.  There have been a number of initiatives to deal with UK concerns over the years under the Common Fisheries Policy.<\/p> <p> There is great concern.  No sector is more threatened by the negotiations than fisheries.  It is important that our Government works closely with other European governments.  There are encouraging signs that this is happening.  Access to British territorial fishing waters is built into the trade negotiations and is seen to be necessary if the desired goal is to be achieved but the Government should be cognisant of the serious concerns of the producer organisations and aware of the European Fisheries Alliance that represents 18,000 fishermen and 3,500 vessels from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and Sweden.  The annual turnover of the sector is &euro;20.7 billion.  Its representatives have come together to collectively ask the governments to hold their ground and defend the interests of our fishing communities.<\/p> <p> If the British do not negotiate a fair deal, we will need to re-examine the Common Fisheries Policy.  A total of 38% of the catch of the Irish fleet is taken from British waters.  If this is lost, we will need to revisit the policy.  I hope it will not come to that.

I have not heard a lot in the Taoiseach's contribution or more generally about the EU's response to Covid-19.  If we consider a variety of countries around the world with a variety of regimes, including Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, South Korea and Iceland, we realise the failure of the Union to act both collectively and as individual member states in any sort of cohesive, focused, effective way regarding Covid-19 is quite telling.  Professor Ferrari hoped the European Research Council would set up a body specifically to address Covid-19 and research all sorts of areas, including strategy, the development of a vaccine and therapies, but this was essentially shot down.  It is quite telling.  After the budget announcement, I mentioned an extraordinary point that may have been lost, which is that the health research budget for 2021 is not a single cent greater than that for 2020.  It is an extraordinary fact but it bears out Professor Ferrari's point on the complete lack of a strategy.  We have argued for a zero-Covid strategy.  Although the Government disagrees with that, should these matters not be debated in a serious way and should scientists not be given the resources to develop their understanding, data and information so we can make informed choices about how to deal with this pandemic?  That does not seem to be happening, which is quite a damning indictment of the failure of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000031#EE00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1603212600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>The European Council made it a high priority to strengthen relations with Africa.  Historically, the relationship between Europe and Africa has been characterised by the exploitation of Africa and her peoples by the ruling classes of Europe.  Let us consider the wealth in Amsterdam, Paris, London and Lisbon that was extracted through the profits from the slave trade.  Today, in the main, there is no direct military rule but there is still a relationship of exploitation by economics.<\/p><p>Associate Professor Lorenzo Kamel, an historian at the University of Bologna, states &quot;the natural resources (fuel, gold, gas etc) of most, if not all, African countries [&hellip;] are still being syphoned off through offshore companies that, to a large extent, are linked to European and American companies and businessmen.&quot;  According to a UN report, over a period of 50 years, the African Continent has lost $1 trillion in illicit financial flows that are operated by western corporations. <\/p><p>This month is Black History Month.  Information such as that I have just outlined should be taught in our schools.  It should also be taught that Ireland has a relationship with all of this.  For example, David La Touche, a founder of Bank of Ireland and a slave owner from a family of slave owners, was paid &pound;7,000, the equivalent of more than &euro;1 million today, for his 385 slaves in Jamaica.  Frederick Douglass, a former slave and leader of the abolitionist movement in America, was exiled to Ireland and England in the period 1845-47.  He  had huge crowds at meetings he organised.  For example, working class women attended his meetings in Cork.  He stated: <\/p> <blockquote> \tI have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. [&hellip;] Instead of the bright blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft grey fog of the Emerald Isle.  I breathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a man. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is the way he explained the welcome he got from ordinary people in this country. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, we saw the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, a new generation of people of colour who will not accept discrimination or second-class citizenship any longer.

He outlined that Mr. Barnier had given a detailed report at the Council meeting on the negotiations with the British on the withdrawal agreement and the Ireland&ndash;Northern Ireland protocol.  I was glad the Taoiseach stated that Mr. Barnier had in his contribution laid particular emphasis on peace in Ireland.  He is not a new convert to peace in Ireland.  I was a colleague of Mr. Barnier on the Council of agriculture ministers from 2007 to 2011.  At that time, he always displayed a great knowledge of, and interest in, Ireland.  He had been regional affairs Commissioner in the late 1990s or early 2000s and he was very familiar with Ireland and the potential for all-Ireland development and to develop the economy on an all-Ireland basis.<\/p> <p>He was very supportive of the then Fianna F&aacute;il Government's applications for structural funds for infrastructural development, particularly in respect of projects of a cross-Border nature.  He is very familiar, knowledgeable and interested in ensuring that we have a lasting and stable peace in our country.  He fully understands the damage that Brexit can do to our island.<\/p> <p> The signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 has been transformative for the entire island.  It has been particularly transformative and beneficial for the region I represent.  I have had the privilege of representing two Border counties over many years, including in the bad days prior to the Good Friday Agreement and in the more positive days in which we have enjoyed so much political progress.  Michel Barnier understands the progress that has been made.  He has reiterated on many occasions the need to ensure that that progress and also the economic progress that have been made for the people North and South are not lost.<\/p> <p> The word \"Brexit\" has been in our political lexicon since January 2013, when the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, announced that his Government was proposing to hold a referendum on British membership of the European Union.  That referendum was held on 23 June 2016.  Unfortunately, the decision was made at that time to leave the European Union.  The issue has dominated political debate here.  The second deadline of 31 October 2019 was missed and Brexit continues to dominate our political discussions.  To the credit of both Houses of the Oireachtas and all of the committees over the past number of years, particularly since 2016, people of every party and none have given an extraordinary amount of time to working on and dealing with the Brexit issue, mindful of the impact that it can have on our island.<\/p> <p> It has been heartening for everyone, particularly those of us who live in Border communities and have the privilege of representing those communities, to witness the progress that has been made since 1998.  We have had the development of the all-Ireland economy, with, for example, enterprises located in our State going on to develop interests in Northern Ireland.  Similarly, businesses in Northern Ireland which only had a presence there prior to 1998 now have a strong presence in our State as well.  In so many instances, those companies have developed into all-Ireland operations, creating jobs for people north, south, east and west.  This has been facilitated by the Single Market and the dismantling of the Border.  Thankfully, in effect, the Good Friday Agreement dismantled the Border infrastructure on our island.<\/p> <p> Last week, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, I instanced the central Border area, comprising Cavan and Monaghan in the South and Tyrone and Fermanagh in the North, as being the least developed area on the island.  These four counties are heavily dependent on three particular sectors - namely, those relating to agrifood, construction products and engineering - to generate employment, in the context of economic development and to generate earnings from exports.  Those sectors are heavily dependent on the Northern Ireland and British markets.  The imposition of tariffs on products from those sectors going to Britain, our primary market, will create major problems regarding the viability of those enterprises and their ability to remain competitive.  We have the double negative of sectors that are the primary economic drivers in the least developed regions being the most heavily dependent on the British market to export their products to in order to generate earnings.<\/p> <p> I have appealed for a deal to be reached on numerous occasions.  In the event of there being no deal, and these sectors being very exposed, Government assistance must be targeted at the areas to which I refer.  There is massive interdependence in the Border economy, North and South.  I can instance it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, knows my county and County Monaghan well.  He will know the enterprises I am speaking about, some of which are situated on our side of the Border and their sister companies on the Fermanagh side.  These are companies are interdependent, part-manufacturing in one jurisdiction and part-assembling in the other.  There will be unbelievable complications and additional cross-Border issues if we do not have a deal.  This is why a deal is particularly important.  The messages from Westminster in recent days in the context of the UK wanting to forge ahead without a deal are very worrying.  Like Deputy Haughey, I thought the Taoiseach was somewhat optimistic that a deal can be reached.  We sincerely hope that it can be achieved because it is absolutely necessary.<\/p> <p> The progress that has been made will be knocked back incalculably if we do not get an agreement.  At the first committee meeting following the British referendum in 2016, I stated that the decision of the British people to leave the European Union knocked the stuffing out of Border communities.  Those of us who lived there through the bad days saw the complete change whereby  communities came together, regardless of whether they were located on the northern side of the Border or on the southern side, be it in Fermanagh, Cavan, Monaghan or Tyrone.  These are huge stakes for our communities and for the entire island.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach stated that, understandably, the commentary by all of the Heads of State and Heads of Government at the Council meeting was very sombre in regard to Covid.  I have said on many occasions in this Chamber that we need an all-Ireland approach to dealing with this pandemic.  We need the restrictions to be comparable North and South and for those restrictions and other measures to be implemented in a similar way as well.  Imposing restrictions and not implementing them on one side of the Border will not help us to eliminate this virus from our island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000031#EE00700","speaker":"1556","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603213200,"counter":324,"content":"<p>On the EU Council meeting, pandemic solutions come to mind.  We have taken particular initiatives in terms of a health solution.  We need co-ordination across Europe in that regard.  We have had an element of co-ordination in regard to financial packages and the possibility of future financial initiatives.  This needs to happen on a global basis and on a Europe-wide basis.  Yesterday, in response to a question, the Taoiseach spoke about the difficulties arising if we are not lucky enough to get a vaccine.  There has been much scientific work done and there has been some really good news regarding a number of vaccine programmes that are operating at this point.  However, there are no guarantees.  We need to ensure a free-flow of money so that businesses and families can access the supports they need.  Beyond this, we need co-ordination in respect of testing regimes.  A number of Deputies have spoken about the difficulties around the test, trace and isolate infrastructure, particularly in the context of schools.  We have a particular difficulty here regarding the speed with which we carry out rapid testing, including through the use of antigen and LAMP tests.  I realise that this is being operated in some places in Europe, particularly in the context of air travel.  We could also use it alongside PCR testing to deal with some of the specific difficulties we face.<\/p>  <p>  It goes without saying that at this point that we also face Brexit.  I welcome what appears to be solidarity from across Europe.  We need to ensure that this is the case.  We also welcome solidarity from the US.

We have had commentary that is not helpful from David Frost, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson.<\/p> <p>Some of the mood music today is better and that is to be welcomed.

My understanding is that figure is correct.  However, the fact is that we have to take into account what Britain threatens.  We have to make preparations.  It is vital that there are contingency plans, including supports for businesses, supports across the Border and east-west preparations.

He mentioned that there should be cross-Border co-operation on Covid-19.  We have been saying that for months and still there is absolutely no cross-Border co-operation on Covid-19.  I have asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs where the locus of co-operation is.  Is it within the D&aacute;il, the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Is it in the Department of Health?  Is there a secretariat?  Is there any structure for co-operation, North and South, on Covid-19?  I am still to get an answer in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 is obviously a significant threat to life and health and we must do our best to keep the numbers down.  We also need balance because the restrictions can also be a threat to life and health throughout the country.  There needs to be a balance between the two.  Will the Minister of State explain why Ireland is currently an outlier in terms of Covid-19 restrictions?  Accordingly to the government response stringency index produced by Our World in Data, Ireland is the second most restricted country in the EU when it comes to Covid-19.  That is before level 5 is put in place.  A comparative analysis between European countries has found Ireland is mid-ranking for incidence of Covid-19.  Many other countries with higher rates of Covid than Ireland have far fewer restrictions in place.<\/p>  <p>  The World Health Organization has stated that restrictions are necessary to protect a health service that is under pressure.  Last night, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, stated on \"Claire Byrne Live\" that there is no crisis in the health service at the moment.  Indeed, consultants in hospitals throughout the country have called openly for people to come to the hospitals because we have a wave of hospital avoidance throughout the country.  People are too fearful to answer the invitations they have received for treatment.<\/p>  <p>  There are three countries in the world where church services are currently cancelled, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and this State, the Republic of Ireland.  Restaurants, pubs and retail outlets are functioning in many other countries throughout Europe safely and in a social distanced way.<\/p>  <p>  There is an extraordinary cost to this.  I have asked the National Public Health Emergency Team, the HSE and the Government to research the costs in the areas of cancer care, heart disease, stroke and mental health.  What is the level of mortality and morbidity as a result of these restrictions?  No one from these organisations has told me that they have carried out any research.  In many ways, the information is missing from half of the equation and decisions are being made blind.<\/p>  <p>  After seven months of talking about Covid-19 and &euro;18 billion in the budget in recent weeks, we still have one of the lowest levels of hospital intensive care beds in the European Union.

This is an incredibly serious situation for Ireland, particularly areas close to the Border like my home town of Dundalk.  Unfortunately, the Government is sleepwalking into this and has not made the necessary arrangements to prepare us for a no-deal Brexit.  Such an outcome would benefit nobody, least of all the United Kingdom.  What is done is done, however, and we have to deal with the facts.<\/p>  <p>  I speak daily to citizens and businesses in and around the Border region.  Brexit is the biggest danger to the region in our lifetime.  We can all remember the dark days of daily bombings, killings and security checkpoints.  We do not want to go back to those dark days and we cannot do so.  What concerns people and businesses along the Border is the lack of preparation for a hard Brexit.  No one seems to know what to expect on 1 January 2021, which is only ten weeks away.  Many workers live on one side of the Border and work on the other side.  They have concerns, especially about possible checkpoints on the Border and the rules that will apply for cross-Border workers.  Will they be taxed differently?  How will social welfare benefits operate?  These people need clarity.  The concern about checkpoints also relates to customs checks.  Can the Minister of State give any clarity on whether there will be fixed customs checks on Border crossings?  Tariffs are another major issue for businesses.<\/p>  <p>  Another issue of concern is cross-Border students.  Dundalk has one of the top institutes of technology in the country.  DkIT has almost 5,000 students, many of whom travel from the North to attend.  These students are in the dark and do not know what is ahead of them.  Is the Minister of State concerned for the future of these students if there is a no-deal Brexit?<\/p>  <p>  Another subject of particular concern along the Border is that of security co-operation.  Will the Minister of State indicate what measures or plans are in place to ensure security co-operation will continue to exist in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Access to security databases has been a major concern.<\/p>  <p>  Hauliers are also facing into an uncertain future.  What obstacles will they face when they have to travel through the UK?  There are horror stories circulating that hauliers from Ireland could face delays of up to ten hours once they reach the UK.  That would have a devastating effect on many food producers, who need to get their produce on supermarket shelves as quickly as possible.  What additional red tape and paperwork are hauliers likely to face?<\/p>  <p>  Last week's budget allocated &euro;100 million to the shared island unit.  I understand this unit will work towards investing in border infrastructure, cross-Border co-operation and related matters.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the unit will play a vital part in maintaining close relations between North and South.  Has the Minister of State discussed this unit with his European counterparts?  If so, has he discussed the idea of the EU matching any funds the Government invests in this unit?  This unit will play a vital role in the Border region and I have no doubt the EU will see this and be only too willing to support such a worthy cause.  I would welcome the comments of the Minister of State on this.  If he does not have a chance to answer all the questions, I would appreciate if he could respond in writing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000033#GG00300","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1603213800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>On this day last week, the General Affairs Council of the European Union met in Luxembourg and agreed on what is now being called a traffic light system.  It is a risk-rating system to co-ordinate travel across EU member states.  This agreement will mean that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control will publish a weekly map of European regions, as opposed to countries, and use the colours of green, orange and red to categorise the contagion risk of Covid-19 in these regions.  On the surface, this would appear to be a good development.  When Covid rates, hopefully, start to fall back across member states we will start to see people once again having the confidence to fly with airlines without complications.  It will be advantageous to green countries.  However, the situation regarding countries designated green seems to be fluid.  Crucially, when people arrive from green countries they will not have to quarantine.  That is good but beyond that, I have grave concerns about how orange and red regions will be treated.  Each member state will decide the appropriate health measures to be put in place for incoming air passengers from these regions.  This does not equate to simplifying Europe-wide air travel.  I am concerned that without a uniform approach by all member states to orange and red regions, we will not see a normal return to air travel any time in the near future.  I implore the Government to seek an immediate overhaul of the traffic light system at the next European Council meeting to ensure there is a common approach across Europe.<\/p>  <p>  There is also an acute need for member states to adopt a common approach to travel from outside the European Union.  What we have now is a patchwork of policies for flights coming from America, Canada, the Middle East and beyond.  With Covid-19 cases on the rise throughout Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, there are few airplanes in our skies.  The real point, however, is that we have time at the moment to devise an A to Z aviation policy that instils confidence in people and gets our airlines back flying.  Airlines are planning their spring and summer schedules for 2021.<\/p> <p>They need certainty and the Government and the European Union need to give them that certainty.  Only last week, Ryanair announced the closure of its bases at Shannon Airport and Cork Airport due to the uncertainty.  What we need in this quiet time in global aviation is the expeditious introduction of testing at all our airports.  We also need to use this unprecedented quiet time to overhaul aviation policy.

By not seeking compensation, we are somewhat complicit in this.  As I said before the European Council meeting, at a minimum, we must demand compensation and work with our EU partners to get it.  Better still, we should work with them to prevent the demolition of these much-needed aid structures in Palestine.<\/p><p>There is a history of the Israeli military and occupation acting with impunity towards international law.  We cannot allow this to continue.  It is up to us, as the people who provided this funding, to demand that it end.  On the ground in Palestine, annexation in name has been paused but <i>de facto<\/i>annexation continues.  According to Peace Now, almost 5,000 settlement units were announced recently.  The building of settlements, the confiscation of Palestinian land and the imposition of Israeli sovereignty on Palestine continue.  This is <i>de facto<\/i>annexation even if it does not go by that name and we need to do more about it.<\/p><p>I will speak about the village of Ras al-Tin and the school that is facing imminent demolition, which was built with Irish Aid funds.  We need to work with our European Union counterparts to prevent this demolition and demand compensation if it goes ahead.  This is an ongoing issue and it will only end if we find a way to end the occupation.  In the meantime, we need to ensure that any breaches of international law do not take place with impunity or without consequences, as has pretty much been the case to date.  I urge the Minister of State to use whatever diplomatic channels he can to address this issue and to seek compensation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000034#HH00200","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1603214400,"counter":331,"content":"<p>People in Ireland are in a difficult position.  They are weary of Brexit, which we have been dealing with for three or four years, and now we have Covid-19.  We have seen the ineptitude of the Government in dealing with Covid-19.  We have also seen the ineptitude of the HSE, which has been unable to cope in any winter in recent years despite having &euro;1 billion extra in annual funding thrown in for good measure to expand the health system.  Now we see that we are unable to deal with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  I have to wonder if it is all a plan to let the people eat cake.  When mention is made of solidarity from Europe, I wonder where that solidarity is.  We hear all these statements from Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Michel Barnier and many others but we are in the dying minutes of the game.  We will be in November next week.  We have only two short months left, including one of the shortest months of the year, and then we have Christmas season.  Before we know it, we will be in 2021 and there will still be no deal.<\/p>  <p>  People need to know what will happen.  Exporters, farmers, ordinary workers and the many machinery companies that create and export wonderful products need some certainty.  What will happen to the truckers?  Will there be ten-hour delays at ports?  Will there be customs checks and so on?  The game is too serious and the stakes too high for all these small business people and those they employ.<\/p>  <p>  We know about all the milk and other exports that go up and down through Northern Ireland and across what is, thankfully, an invisible border that should not be there.  The Border is there, unfortunately, and we have to deal with it.  We cannot hide and run away from it.  I do not know how long ago the then Taoiseach and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, came back with a game-changer known as the backstop.  Everything was supposed to be fine once we had the backstop.  It was as if the Alps were protecting us but that is all gone and the sands have shifted.<\/p>  <p>  We need solidarity from our European partners now more than ever.  They should be able to give us that.  After all, we have been the best boys in the class in Europe.  When the Taoiseach came home from the most recent summit, it became clear that we will be the fourth highest net contributor to the EU.  The Taoiseach told us it was a good deal, even though we will be cleaned out.  We were cleaned out in the so-called bailout after we bailed out the banks.  The EU charged us 6% interest, the highest rate it could charge.  We got money from the IMF at the time at a rate of 2.9%.  Where is the solidarity?  I do not see much of it.  The people who I represent in Tipperary, be they farmers, manufacturers, exporters or families, do not see any solidarity.   They are worried about the future of their families and their ability to live and survive in 2021 with Brexit, not to mention Covid-19.  Where is the solidarity?<\/p>  <p>  We are already at the top of the class in Europe for restrictions.  At 12 midnight tomorrow, we will again be at the top of the class.  We are jumping up again to show how good we are to Europe.  We want to show we are great people because we do this and that.  We have the fourth lowest number of cases, although there is no transparency on case numbers and PCR tests.  Other Deputies have mentioned the tests that should be done but will not be done.  What is the HSE protecting?  Why will it not take on some of the people who have come forward with tests at a minuscule cost of &euro;10, &euro;20 and &euro;30 per head?  The HSE prefers to pay &euro;195 per head.  It is all about control because if there is a new test, the HSE might be found out.<\/p>  <p>  We need honesty and integrity in the system.  We need support and we need to remove the blindfolds from people's eyes.  We must be honest and level with the people because, thankfully, the numbers of deaths in Ireland are lower than they were in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015.  One death is one too many.  Why can people not wake up and see this and tear the answers out of the Government if it will not give them freely?  The Government will not give the answers because it is all about control.  The media are controlled as well.<\/p>  <p>  The House will discuss restrictions tomorrow night and we will have the Garda issuing fines.  We will crucify and perish our people.  We are commemorating the anniversary of the death of Se&aacute;n Treacy and the two O'Dwyer brothers who were murdered in Bansha by crown forces last Sunday 100 years ago, yet here we are perishing our nation and destroying our children and our future.  We are throwing billions of euro at this.  Where is the Government getting that money?  Who is giving it the money which has to be paid back?<\/p>  <p>  We have no honesty or transparency.  We have a health system that is not fit for purpose and has left us in this perilous situation.  I have come to the conclusion that this is being done deliberately to let old people die.  We will kill all the young people with abortion.  Some 6,666 of them were aborted last year in Ireland.  That is what the Government is at.  We cherish the people equally but not the unborn or the elderly.  I ask the Minister of State to level with the people.  We should get solidarity from Europe on this.  Why do we have to be the best boys in the class when we get nowhere and get no thanks for it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000034#HH00300","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215000,"counter":332,"content":"<p>I will return perhaps to the European Council.  I completely agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath to the extent that we are an outlier in Europe.  We have imposed far greater restrictions on people than any other European state over the past six months consistently, and for what?  For a policy that has utterly failed.  I appreciate that this is not necessarily the remit of the Department of the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, but I am sure he will troop through the lobbies and we will roll over all these restrictions without debate.  Democratic oversight, parliamentary accountability and so on are key tenets of the rule of law, which we criticise Hungary for not adhering to.  When it does not suit us here to adhere likewise for political reasons, we do exactly the same thing.  Is Viktor Orb&aacute;n still in the same European Parliament political group as Fine Gael and the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, or has he left it?  In any event the approach Fianna F&aacute;il is adopting is very much at odds with what the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, its European family, is advocating, which relates to parliamentary accountability.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to return to the traffic light system.  We shut down our aviation and travel sectors and told people they could not go on holidays and told public and civil servants we would penalise them and make them take two weeks' unpaid leave if they did.  We did so without any statutory basis which was, I think, entirely unlawful but, ultimately, the Irish courts and I presume the European courts will end up adjudicating on that.  In any event it is now proposed, as the Government prepares to lock down society, that we will open up aviation.  We could not open up during the summer.  We could not even allow people to meet outdoors during the summer, but now it is suddenly safe to meet outdoors.  We will open up aviation.  I welcome the fact that we are to open it up.  We badly need it.  We are members of the European Union but we never talk about that as something important other than as a means to say how much better than Boris Johnson we are.  We were so proud of how much better than Mr. Johnson we were in our response to Covid until we ended up taking the same knee-jerk reactions but just before he did.  Britain does not have the same centralised government structure we have, and now its cities, in particular the northern cities, are fighting back.  They are right to do so and to say this is a punishment of the poor, effectively for being poor.  If one looks at a map of incidences of Covid-19 and a map of incidences of poverty across Clare, Dublin, Meath or anywhere else on this island, they are essentially the same map, as they are in the United Kingdom and in most other countries.<\/p>  <p>  I want to know one thing in particular.  A green system is proposed which requires less than 4% of tests being positive and fewer than 25 positive cases in 10,000 people over the previous week.  Notwithstanding all the sacrifices the Irish people have borne, due to the failure of the State's reaction and the failure to set up any sort of tracing system we are far in excess of that, so what will we do about orange and red areas?  Will there be testing?  What is being done with other members of the European Union to agree a protocol on testing between these countries?  If I understand the outcome of the Council correctly, there can be no impediment whatsoever on travel - other than the impediment the Irish Government in its genius dreamt up which said people are free to travel, that freedom of movement is part of the European Union, but those who do so will take two weeks' unpaid leave.  The Government says that is not a punishment, a restriction or an impediment.  Is \"my ass it is not\" unparliamentary language?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000035#JJ00100","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215000,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I am afraid it is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000035#JJ00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>How on earth could that not be an impediment?

It is quite clear from what the Council agreed that people can travel between green regions without any restrictions, that a person is always allowed to go back to his or her member state of nationality and that any measures restricting freedom of movement need to be proportionate but that one should not in principle be refused entry.

There will probably still be time at the end if any of the Deputies wish to ask further specific questions.  One of the points made was that I am not the Minister for Health so I cannot answer questions relating to health.  I can answer on what I did at the General Affairs Council last week, but that involves a wider Government response as well.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for their statements and questions and also for the solidarity they are showing on Brexit.  We are unified on that approach here and I am very keen for that to continue.  The European Council, as the Taoiseach said, discussed external relations.  The focus this time was on the relationship with Africa and African countries, but a number of other issues were also discussed.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders at the summit agreed to hold a strategic discussion on the southern neighbourhood, that is, Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia, in December coming.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council also returned to its discussion on Belarus.  Leaders again condemned the continuing violence against peaceful protesters, which we on every side of this House again condemn, I am sure, and expressed our solidarity with Lithuania and Poland in light of retaliatory measures imposed on them by Belarus.<\/p>  <p>  The leaders held a lengthy discussion on Turkey at their meeting on 1 and 2 October and further discussions last week in light of renewed unilateral and provocative maritime activity by Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean.  In light of Turkey's recently announced plan to open the coastline of Varosha, a city on the eastern edge of Cyprus, the European Council again urged respect for UN Security Council resolutions and reiterated its full solidarity with Greece and Cyprus.  Leaders will return to this topic in upcoming meetings.<\/p>  <p>  Relations with Russia again featured at the meeting, this time in the context of the 2014 shooting down of flight MH17.  The European Council called on the Russian Federation to continue the trilateral negotiations between Australia, the Netherlands and the Russian Federation.  The victims of this tragedy deserve truth and the leaders expressed their support for all efforts to establish truth, justice and accountability.<\/p>  <p>  The major item on the external relations agenda was the EU's relationship with Africa.  A summit with African Union leaders had originally been planned for October 2020 and will now take place in 2021.  Last week's discussion was a welcome opportunity for European leaders to consider our strategic priorities for our relationship with our neighbouring continent.  While there is extensive co-operation between the EU and Africa across a range of areas, there is potential for much greater coherence and synergy.  Leaders confirmed the high priority the EU places on strengthening its strategic relations with Africa and on its partnership with the African Union.  Ireland fully supports this approach.  A more ambitious and effective EU-Africa partnership is a strategic objective of Ireland's Africa strategy.  Stronger political partnerships with Africa and African countries are essential to consolidate peace, stability and sustainable development.  Ireland has strong partnerships right across the continent and we will build on these to help deliver a strong partnership between the EU and Africa.  Co-operation between the EU and Africa is more important than ever in the context of the current pandemic.  We must show solidarity with Africa in the fight against Covid-19, including through work on vaccines as global public goods.  To help address the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Council also agreed to further international debt relief efforts for African countries.  In this respect the Council was asked to prepare a common approach by the end of November 2020.<\/p>  <p>  While the EU is Africa's biggest trading partner, our trading relationship is not as substantial as it could be.  The African Continental Free Trade Area has enormous potential to advance economic integration in Africa and to boost EU-Africa trade and investment.  We must work in partnership in order that Africa and Europe can each achieve green and digital transformations to underpin our shared future prosperity.  Engagement with African issues and with African partners will be a key part of Ireland's UN Security Council membership from 2021.  The EU-African summit, which is planned for 2021, presents a valuable opportunity to raise the level of political co-operation between our two continents.  By working together in support of multilateralism, the EU and Africa can make a greater impact on the global agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Again, I thank Deputies for their statements and questions.  I assure them that the Taoiseach will continue to report to the House in advance of and following the regular meetings of the European Council.  I will now do my best to deal with the questions that arose.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald asked for an explanation of the text of the European Council conclusions.  Members asked the Commission \"to give timely consideration to unilateral and time-limited contingency measures that are in the EU's interest\".  What I think is meant by this is that the European Commission will look at the issue of state aid, what we can do to help business in the event of a no-deal Brexit and what other contingencies will be there.  It is notable that despite the mood music being better and the fact that talks are proceeding, there are - I would say this at the General Affairs Council as well - more countries engaging on this issue and wondering what are the preparations for a no-deal Brexit.<\/p> <p>To explain to Deputy McDonald, that is there in terms of important preparation.<\/p> <p> Deputy Brady raised an interesting point on nuclear co-operation and nuclear materials.  That is an area of common interest between Britain and the European Union and was a feature of the political declaration last year.  It is something Britain wants progress on and is willing to make agreement on despite the fact that, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is not part of Europe.  That is obviously a critical issue for us where I, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Deputy Brady live on the east coast.  Progress is being made and hopefully that will be finalised but the Deputy is right to raise the issue.<\/p> <p> I will give the Deputy the exact answer on the issue of the Moria camp.  The actual mechanics of that are a matter for the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs.  However, the issue of migration is, obviously, a key feature of what leaders do at the European Council and is a key issue when one deals with member states, particularly, in the Mediterranean area.  We are aware that, this year, 675 migrants lost their lives - the poor souls - after crossing the Mediterranean Sea.  We notified the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, and she notified the Commission that Ireland will admit 50 people in family groups who were displaced from Moria and who are beneficiaries of international protection as part of our programme.  We will relocate four unaccompanied minors and this forms part of a previous commitment to accept six unaccompanied minors, eight of whom arrived in the State in June.<\/p> <p> Deputies Howlin and Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of fish.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked us to hold the ground in this regard.  That is important.  The Taoiseach and I met with President Macron and my counterpart, Mr. Cl&eacute;ment Beaune, last week and the issue of fish, it must be said, was really the main item on the agenda.  Holding the ground is what we are doing.  The Government has forged an informal alliance among European Council members on the issue of fish and has certainly been in touch with Mr. Michel Barnier about the importance of that issue.  It is crucially important for our economic prospects but, particularly, in areas that do not really have other economic prospects.  The British see it as a totemic issue of nationhood.  It is that, but it has practical consequences in terms of both jobs and the food supply.  It is important.  The Government is therefore very much holding the ground.  In my discussions with European colleagues, namely, the Belgian deputy Prime Minister and my French and Dutch counterparts, the issue of fish has been part of the agenda.  That is the same with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  He had a one-on-one meeting with Mr. Michel Barnier, as did the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, at which the issue was high on the agenda.  I assure fishing communities right across the country that we have their backs on this matter, which is critical for us.  We will, however, let the negotiations play out.  I will not say too much more about that.<\/p> <p> I was interested by the comments of Deputies Carthy and Fitzpatrick on the issue of preparations.  I am aware Deputy Carthy rowed back his criticism somewhat in the context of us not holding roadshows at this time of year when he acknowledged after some time that this was obviously because of the pandemic.  The Department of Foreign Affairs hosts a monthly Brexit stakeholder forum.  As I understand it, politicians are invited to attend.  I will check that but we do not have massive numbers of political representatives in attendance and, certainly, those who have been present have not contributed.  I propose to hold a Brexit preparedness briefing for members of the Oireachtas.  I will arrange that with the officials.  The complaints in this regard are not valid.  We are doing a huge amount and it is up to all of us in our own communities to show leadership on this.<\/p> <p> Deputy McGrath asked whether there will be customs checks.  There will not be customs checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic but, deal or no deal, there will be customs checks between Britain and the island of Ireland.  That is the reality.  I am concerned that not every business is really in the zone for that change.  We are certainly doing as much as we can-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000035#JJ00500","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>They do not have to be when the Government is shutting them down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00200","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We are not shutting down trading companies that are involved in importing and exporting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The Government is shutting everything down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00400","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":341,"content":"<p>There will be an opportunity for questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00500","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":342,"content":"<p>There is no shutdown of that type of activity, which continues.

That is important.  The issue of LGBT-free zones in Poland is absolutely horrific but it is not part of the rule of law discussions at the moment.  Such discussions in respect of Poland centre on the issue of the judiciary.  I will say to our Polish friends that when people look at what is going on with the judiciary and with LGBT-free zones in their country, it is, to say it most politely, a huge disappointment. Poland is a strong partner for Ireland.  There is strong solidarity regarding Brexit and, through our economies, in respect of the benefits of the Single Market.  When we see what is going on in Poland, it gives rise to a sense of disbelief.  Poland needs to look carefully at what it is doing in respect of the judiciary and LGBT free-zones and how its image abroad will affect its economy because people will look twice when they see what is going on.  I am concerned about this.  I suggest that it is a matter for the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and, indeed, the European affairs committee.  I am more than happy to be involved but it will be a matter for the D&aacute;il in a debate on the rule of law in Poland.  When we discussed it at the General Affairs Council last week, member states were keen that people would interact with their own parliaments in respect of it.  It is great that Deputy O'Callaghan and many other people are raising these issues.  However, we need to have a full debate on them in the Oireachtas, possibly at some point in the new year.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of Covid-19 engagement, people are telling me in the Chamber that we are much stricter than in other countries.  The reality is, however, that even since last weekend, there have been many changes in European countries.  I do not have any responsibility for health but I am kept apprised of what is happening in European countries or where there are a lot of green zones.  The number of patients in ICUs in Sweden has doubled in a short time.  Finland has seen a massive increase in the past few weeks.  Latvia introduced new restrictions last week and Belgium introduced new measures yesterday.  France re-entered a state of public health emergency on Saturday.  A partial lockdown went into force in the Netherlands on Wednesday.  Luxembourg is having a meeting of its Government Council this weekend.  Germany is not quite as badly hit at the moment but new measures were taken last week.  A new Covid-19 decree came into force yesterday in Italy.  Portugal has raised its state of contingency to \"higher state of calamity\" status.  In Spain, new measures came into effect in Catalonia from Friday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00600","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>Do any of them have a 5 km limit in place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00700","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>What I am saying is-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00800","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I accept that they all-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK00900","speaker":"1518"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I am saying that as of-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK01000","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1603215600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>On a point of order.

The pattern is the same all over Europe in terms of how health systems are coping, how countries are dealing with Covid-19 and what the worries are.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others questioned Deputy Richmond on Covid-19 engagement.  The European Union does not have the health competence.  I know that if tomorrow we held a referendum for a new treaty to give Europe a health competence, there would be massive opposition to this from some of the left-wing parties because they have opposed every European Union treaty.<\/p>  <p>  The truth is this and the Taoiseach would say it as well.  He said to me that he was Minister for Health during the SARS-CoV-2 crisis and he believes the difference is fundamental in terms of co-operation at European level.  The point, however, is that it still does not have a health competence.  As I understand it, there will be video conference meetings between the leaders regarding Covid-19 co-ordination.  These will be organised by the Presidency and the proposal that they be held was certainly suggested at the Council.  That is useful.  The travel restrictions will be reviewed regularly.  By the end of October, the Commission will outline the further Covid-19  responses it believes are necessary and it will co-ordinate in respect of emergency health assessment testing strategies, quarantine and contact tracing.<\/p> <p>Our app has been linked with those of two other countries as the start of an integration process.  The Commission is working on improving the overall EU framework for response to health crises and is examining the revision of the mandates of the European Centre for Disease Control, ECDC.  The Commission is launching a pharmaceutical strategy and is taking a lead on the issue of vaccines as well and common vaccine purchase.  There is significant activity at EU level despite the fact it does not have a health competence.  Earlier on in the year there was a great deal of criticism of the Union's response but there has been a major change.  The Taoiseach feels it very useful to talk to his health colleagues about what is going on.  One of the points raised by Members related to antigen testing.  The Taoiseach was certainly talking to colleagues from France and many other countries that have brought it in.  He is determined to do that.  Testing has been approved by HIQA and a clinical examination is under way in this country.  The Taoiseach is determined to do this as quickly as possible because it will be a game changer, particularly for education settings but also for travel, as Deputy Cathal Crowe pointed out in his strong appeal for a strong commitment on Shannon Airport.<\/p> <p> The traffic light system is in place.  Nearly everywhere is now a red zone.  Parts of Finland and Greece are green zones.  The restrictions will be removed from green zones tonight or tomorrow.  The Deputy is correct that it is part of the recommendation and they will be gone.  There was a Government decision today that I am not privy to because I was not at Cabinet, but it will set out the remainder of that in detail.  Antigen testing is a key part of making sure that can be done quickly.  Unfortunately, it is not relevant when almost everywhere is red and we are at level 5 but it at least provides a framework to allow airports such as Shannon to have some certainty as to what will happen when circumstances change.<\/p> <p> Deputy Richmond was concerned that countries are ready to move on from Brexit.  In a way they are because whatever has to happen must happen by the end of the year.  He was concerned that only two and a half hours were spent talking about Brexit but that is a long time in the context of a meeting that started at 4 p.m.  Brexit was the first item, there was dinner later on for the leaders and then there was a meeting the following morning on a number of issues.  In the context of the time allowed, two and a half hours was a strong time commitment at that meeting.  It was a confidential session; there was none of what is called Antici reporting whereby meetings are reported outside.  It was highly confidential.  Leaders were extremely frank with each other, with Mr. Charles Michel and with Mr. Michel Barnier and it was very productive as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000036#KK01700","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603216200,"counter":355,"content":"<p>I apologise to the Minister of State but I am conscious that there are two minutes left for questions and he must have his wrap-up as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000037#LL00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1603216200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I gave my wrap-up at the start when I spoke about Africa.

It should be noted that this was something that was put forward, I think, during our Presidency in 1990.

We will continue to prioritise the Middle East peace process on the Security Council.  We will do whatever we can to advance efforts towards a just and normal peace.  We resolutely oppose annexation.  Any such moves are illegal under international law and jeopardise the prospect of a viable and sovereign Palestinian state.  Any announcements Israel is making on suspending plans to annex parts of the occupied territories are welcome but these plans need to be permanently withdrawn.<\/p>  <p>  Everyone speaks of solidarity with Ireland but the practical measures from member states are real as well.  When the Taoiseach spoke of Michel Barnier's priorities for the negotiations, he almost understated it.  When Mr. Barnier, or Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d from the Commission speaks, their number one priority is peace on the island of Ireland.  The understanding these key individuals have about our country, North and South, the difficulties there and the Border is incredible.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and my predecessor, Deputy McEntee, brought many ministers over to the Border and they still talk about that.  Those visits to the Border were very useful to let people know the reality of life on the ground.  Many of Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s constituents and many constituents in south County Armagh and south County Down met other European colleagues and that has had a profound impact on the negotiations and it was welcome.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding other practical solidarity measures, the Brexit adjustment fund was sought by Ireland and Belgium.  It is a &euro;5 billion fund for countries and sectors most affected by Brexit.  We are the most affected and officials are working with the Commission on this. Many hands will be up of course whenever money becomes available.  The PEACE PLUS programme is a hugely significant financial commitment from the EU and the State.  It goes back to the shared island concept.  It has been matched by us and expanded on by the Government.  It is a huge gesture of solidarity.  Money from the EU will be spent in the North of Ireland despite the fact that it is leaving the Union.  I thank our European colleagues for this. One of the issues I will work, which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is very concerned about, is to ensure that in future years we avail of whatever discretionary funding is available from Europe to the best of our abilities and make sure we get as much as possible.

It removes many of the restrictive eligibility requirements, for example, dependency on social protection payments.  I emphasise that those using school-aged childcare services are not ineligible for the national childcare scheme.  In fact, 45 subsidised hours are available where parents are engaged in work, training or study and 20 subsidised hours are available for parents who are not engaged in work, training or study.  In this way, the scheme has anti-poverty or disadvantage objectives built in by encouraging work or training.  The definition of \"work\" is extremely broad and covers full-time, part-time, week on week off and zero-hour contracts, and the study rule is also generous and allows parents to access 45 hours of childcare when competing any qualification from level 1 of the national framework of qualifications, even for a small number of hours per week.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to increase the number of subsidised hours from September, partly to address the concerns that some providers had raised.  A sponsorship arrangement is available within the national childcare scheme that offers additional support for families with complex needs.  Once a child meets the criteria for sponsorship by a given sponsor body the child can automatically avail of 45 hours per week.<\/p>  <p>  We have undertaken a series of measures to raise awareness about the sponsorship programme.  The Department has been working directly with the sponsor bodies to build their capacity and support the new relationships been built between the sponsor bodies and the providers.  We have been working with the city and county childcare committees to assist them with their queries.  We have also been working with the teen parent support programme to ensure teen parents are aware of their right to access childcare under the national childcare scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Overall, the national childcare scheme is designed to be highly inclusive and meet the needs of the most economically vulnerable children and those living in other forms of disadvantage.

They could fall into a vulnerable category but they are not vulnerable enough to come to the attention of Tusla.  This can be where the breakdown is.  The Minister mentioned the sponsorship programme.  Under the new system, the HSE can refer only children aged under four, which rules out after-school services.  Many people who think they might have to go to Tusla first for assistance or additional help would run a mile because they are afraid of the system and that somehow they will be highlighted as bad parents, when this absolutely might not be the case.

The Department is also providing additional supports to Tusla to allow these services to cope with the additional complications arising from Covid-19.

Emergency refuge accommodation provides a safe haven for those experiencing a threat to their safety, which is why Tusla has worked with refuges to identify and secure additional accommodation places where needs have arisen.  Tusla has supported the sector with additional staff, personal protective equipment, PPE, and ICT resources in order that the services can remain open to everybody who needs them.<\/p>  <p>  In the budget, I prioritised resourcing for Tusla so that it can meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our society.  I secured an additional &euro;61 million for Tusla this year, giving it an annual budget of &euro;878 million.  I have engaged significantly with representatives of the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence sector in recent weeks, and will continue to do so to hear their experiences of the pandemic and what my Department and Tusla can do to support them more.

This has been borne out by a good deal of research, particularly a recent piece of research commissioned by my Department and undertaken by SpunOut called How's Your Head.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the vital role played by youth work in providing support to young people, funding levels were maintained throughout the current crisis period.  This enabled the youth services to continue to provide services to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people. <\/p>  <p>  Early in my tenure, I was able to provide an additional small grant to support local funded organisations, youth information centres and youth clubs to defray some of their Covid-19 costs.  Since then, in last week's budget, I secured an additional &euro;5 million investment in youth services for 2021.  I see this funding as supporting the front-line services as they seek to innovate in order to continue to provide critical services to vulnerable young people.  I hope this significant increase in funding is seen as a recognition of the role youth services play in the lives of young people, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic.  My officials and I have a good working relationship with the youth sector and I will continue this engagement as we seek to support young people through this challenging period. <\/p>  <p>  At a broader level, my Department is committed to leading a discussion with all relevant Departments and agencies to ensure that mental health services, educational institutions, youth services and sports clubs work together, so each is aware of the challenges young people have been facing and can help ease them back into everyday life and support their resilience.

It is important that a young person from any area in the country should be able to avail of youth services.

The sector showed huge resilience in its initial reopening on 29 June and the subsequent reopening in September.  It led the way for schools by showing how the public health guidance could be implemented, which gave real confidence that we could apply such guidance in schools.<\/p>  <p>  In the budget this year, I have secured a total of &euro;638 million for early learning and care programmes and initiatives next year.  An additional &euro;3.6 million in funding will be allocated to services participating in the action and inclusion model, AIM, in 2021 and this funding will allow for a further 10% increase in the number of children with disabilities who receive targeted supports under AIM, compared with the 2020 funding allocation.  In addition, I have secured access for the sector to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, with a critical exemption to the turnover rule that applies to all other participants in the scheme.  This will be worth &euro;60 million for the first three months of next year.  It is important to note that the sector received a unique and extensive range of supports in 2020, which is estimated at a value of &euro;180 million above and beyond the childcare budget that was originally in place for 2020.  That is indicative of the value and importance that is placed on the sector by me, my Department and the whole Government.<\/p>  <p>  In recent times, the primary focus of my Department has been on sustaining the early learning and school age childcare sector.  We have kept services open by funding the additional costs associated with following the public health guidance and lower occupancy and through encouraging greater uptake of childcare places.  The key new contributor to the early learning and care, ELC, and school age childcare, SAC, sectors in 2021 is the employment wage subsidy scheme which funds up to &euro;200 per week per staff member.  That funding is now secure until 23 March next year, at which point I will continue to work to ensure that the sector is adequately provided for in any successor to the EWSS.<\/p>  <p>  A second key contributor to the sector in 2021 will be to encourage more parents to access safe and more affordable early learning and childcare services.  We saw a reduction in demand in 2020 in both numbers and hours but despite that, I retained all funding for childcare in budget 2021, meaning there is funding available now for up to 20,000 new families to join the national childcare scheme and access subsidies of up to &euro;200 per child.  There will also be funding for higher subsidies in 2021 for families who avail of the national childcare scheme or other schemes but are now on lower incomes because of Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  My focus has been on the sustainability of services in the context of Covid-19 throughout the past year, and that will remain my focus in 2021.  I will also focus on protecting jobs through supporting staff wages and continuing to invest in schemes that save money for parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000041#RR00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1603218600,"counter":408,"content":"<p>The Minister acknowledged the great effort of people in the childcare sector and thanked them for the groundwork they put in prior to the opening of the schools.

His questions asked about the establishment of childcare Ireland.  It is a commitment in the programme for Government.  It involves ensuring that childcare Ireland will expand high-quality early learning and care in school-age childcare and that we have best practice and innovation in community and private settings, develop career paths for early learning and care and school-age childcare and expand S&iacute;olta, which is the early years curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  Before we set up any new agency, I want to undertake an operational review of the bodies working in the area, something that was called for under First 5, the whole-of-government strategy for babies, young children and their families.  This review is now under way.  Its objective is to ensure the operating system is fit for purpose and to implement departmental childcare policy related to quality, affordability and accessibility to the scale and standards required in an evolving and expanding sector. <\/p>  <p>  Early learning and care in the school-age childcare sector has grown substantially over the past ten years.  The review of the operating model will make recommendations to better support high-quality, accessible and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare services for families and children and make sure the administration of all of these programmes is undertaken in an effective way.  This new operating system will be designed to be transparent.  There will be good standards of governance, and it will be accountable and will provide value to the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  We want to be able to link what we are doing in my Department with what is happening in other Departments and agencies.  The first meeting of the oversight group undertaking the review took place on 16 October and the review will conclude in May 2021.  It will be led by my Department, in collaboration with other Departments.  It wants to secure an outside consultant by tender before Christmas to assist in some of the research.  It is important that we base the assumptions and any changes we undertake on properly completed research.  The research will examine the variety of options for the administrative infrastructure of childcare in this country. <\/p>  <p>  That work feeds into two other pieces of work which are relevant to the Deputy's question on wages in the childcare sector.  I briefly mentioned the workforce planning model in response to Deputy Paul Murphy.  It is all about ensuring that there is a long-term and viable career for childcare professionals, many of whom are undertaking lengthy training and education at levels 7 and 8 before leaving the sector after two or three years cause wages are so low.  There is a retention problem.  We know that where childcare workers are leaving and staff are not retained, the educational outcomes for children they look after are broken because the children do not have continuity of care with the childcare professional they know. <\/p>  <p>  The funding model is the other element.  We are putting a significant amount of money, some &euro;638 million, into the system.  We have to be sure that funding is going to the right areas and that staff have good wages, providers are sustainable and parents' out-of-pocket costs are met.  Sometimes people give out about research and say it pushes back change by another year but, as I said to Deputy Whitmore, too often when it comes to childcare we just slap something down because it is necessary.  We have had this approach for ten years.  It is time to take a bigger step and ask how we are going to develop this sector in the long term.  Once the three pieces of research to be undertaken next year are complete, we can use that information to make significant decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000042#SS00600","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1603219200,"counter":420,"content":"<p>On research, my colleague, the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, commissioned the consultancy, Crowe, to complete an independent review of the costs of providing childcare in the early years services in Ireland.  The review was published by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, this week.  The former Minister commissioned that work because of staff turnover.  As the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, said, this has a significant impact on continuity of service but also on individual children who build up relationships with childcare workers.<\/p>  <p>  The sector lacks a sick pay system.  At the same time, there are high costs for parents.  One of the issues highlighted in the Crowe report published by the Minister is that there is evidence of higher costs for a higher quality of service, whereby staff who are more highly trained are providing a higher quality of service.

My Department has the ECCE scheme in place under which the provider gets a higher capitation rate when the ECCE room is led by someone with a level 7 qualification or higher.  There are still problems in the sector.  I absolutely accept that.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Funchion asked for the Crowe report to be published for a long time.

The difficulty is that if one focuses on that, as the Minister did in his press statement, it will be turned back on him by Merrion Street as a justification for not increasing the subsidy.

The Deputy will have seen a very detailed section in the programme for Government on this particular area.

In addition, there are children benefiting from the legacy schemes also.<\/p>  <p>  The online application process was designed to be accessible and user-friendly, although I acknowledge that not everybody found it so.  The flexibility of the NCS means that the scheme is designed to recognise that each family's childcare needs are different and, depending on the particular application type and family circumstances of an applicant, the processing time can vary between applications.<\/p> <p>For income-based applications, the quickest way for a parent to have income assessed is to use the Fast Track option online.  Fast Track assessment gathers information from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for the most recent year for which full income information is available.  A parent can choose not to use the Fast Track assessment if he or she wants - for example, if his or her income decreased significantly in the previous tax year or if he or she wants to opt out of automatic assessment.  This will require the parent to upload documents to support the application.  The NCS advises parents choosing this option that the assessment will take longer to process than Fast Track assessments.<\/p> <p> Applications take longer to process where the scheme administrator is awaiting further documents to be submitted by the applicant.  Subsidies can only be paid when an application is successfully completed, a childcare identifier code key, CHICK, has been registered with a childcare provider and the parent has confirmed on the system that all the details are correct.  It is a key aspect of the scheme that all claims are paid in arrears based on the attendance of a child. This is a key financial and governance control to ensure we are maximising the benefits of public moneys and that the investment is following the child.  Once the process is completed, parents and providers can access subsidies of up to &euro;200 per child, per week, for many years.

Therefore, is there not some way of backdating?  I am being told by providers, and parents in certain instances, that during the time it takes to deal with applications, parents are paying either the full fees or, in certain cases, the childcare provider is trying to take the hit.

The NCS gives greater subsidies to those children who are most in need because of their familial circumstances.  Therefore, the amount that each provider is getting has to be linked to the particular child, and that is done through the CHICK.  It is a more complicated system than the one used under the ECCE scheme but this is because the result and support provided to each child are far more tailored.  Under the ECCE scheme, every child has got the same irrespective of the income of the parent.  This is probably related to what Deputy Whitmore mentioned.

It is a proposed 14-storey development - twice the height cap in that part of the city - with 506 co-living beds in Dublin city centre.  According to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Dublin local authorities, there have been more than 36 co-living planning applications in recent times, totalling more than 5,055 co-living bedrooms in the capital.  Comparing that to the paltry number of live planning applications and permissions for affordable housing under the Government's serviced sites fund speaks volumes about our broken housing system.  We can see little or no investment in affordable homes but outstretched arms to equity investors queueing up to build co-living.  There is also a concerning trend of change-of-use applications from student accommodation, some of which now lies vacant, unfortunately, to co-living.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be clear: co-living is a bad form of accommodation.  It must not be confused with share living or co-housing, two eminently sensible concepts that should be supported and that are already permissible under our planning codes.  Co-living is a greed-driven model that seeks to pack as many people as possible into as small a space as possible to maximise profits.  These are nothing short of gentrified tenements with asking rents estimated at &euro;1,300 per month for a single person.  Controversial planning regulations introduced by Deputy Eoghan Murphy in 2018 allow co-living developments that provide 12 sq. m of personal living space for a single person.  For the benefit of anyone who does not know what 12 sq. m is, it is the size of an average car parking space.<\/p>  <p>  This concept is dreamt up by global equity investors looking to exploit the high demand for housing and apartments in our urban centres.  The funds have access to unlimited investment capital and can outbid regular residential developers when buying prime city centre land.  As a consequence, they are driving up the cost of that land and making standard residential development in our city centres even more unaffordable.<\/p>  <p>  Why are we allowing private investors to dictate the terms of how our cities are being built?  The House need not take my word for it but should listen to the views of the current Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government when he was in opposition.  Last July, he said he wanted the Planning Acts to be amended to block further co-living developments.  At the time, the future Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government compared co-living to emergency accommodation family hubs.  He described co-living as \"a bonkers policy\" and urged Deputy Eoghan Murphy to scrap it.  His boss at the time is now the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  He described co-living as \"battery cage-type accommodation\".  The future Taoiseach rightly asked whether we were going back to the era of tenements.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien is now the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is the Taoiseach.  The question is whether they have banned co-living.  The answer is \"No\" and, instead, they have announced a review.  One media report recently suggested that instead of scrapping co-living the Minister may allow it in a \"modified form\".<\/p> <p>We simply do not need a review.  We need the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to keep his word and to scrap what he rightly called a \"bonkers\" policy.  If co-living was bonkers before Covid-19, how on earth can it be justified now?<\/p> <p> The Bill before us does three straightforward things.  First, it removes co-living from planning law, bringing an end to any new co-living planning permission and developments.  Second, it scraps the inferior design standards, also introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for build to rent apartments.  Why should renters have smaller apartments with less dual aspect and natural light, less storage, less car parking and less comfort than owners of private apartments?  The straight answer is they should not.  Third, and importantly, the Bill repeals the controversial power introduced by Deputy Kelly when he was Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2016, allowing Ministers to make profound changes to planning law without a vote of the Oireachtas, while riding roughshod over the democratically agreed planning rules of local authorities.  If the Minister believes, as I do, in the need for good quality affordable accommodation in our towns and cities, then he must support this Bill.  It is the time to end co-living.<\/p> <p> I appreciate the Minister has important matters to hand such as drafting the emergency legislation on banning evictions but we are seeing a worrying trend of the Minister either not attending or not remaining even to hear the first round of contributions from the Opposition, something even the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, did not do on his worst of days.  I would like the Minister of State to raise that concern with the Minister, not just for my benefit but for the benefit of other Opposition Members, when he next speaks to him.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000047#XX00800","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603222800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, an Teachta &Oacute; Broin, for bringing forward this Bill to ban co-living developments.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is from my constituency and while we have no such developments in progress that does not mean they will not be here in the future.  I am already dealing with them on a small scale and there is no disputing the fact that unless the Minister is stopped, we will have large scale co-living developments in places such as Balbriggan and Swords and right across north County Dublin.  It is ridiculous that we have to discuss banning these co-living developments, especially in the era of Covid-19, which has exposed the dangers of overcrowded living conditions for all to see.  These developments are unacceptable and they are an unbelievable waste of land.<\/p>  <p>  We have the greatest housing crisis since the foundation of the State.  When the State was founded, we had men such as Se&aacute;n Lemass and No&euml;l Browne, who pushed for mass State sponsored social house building programmes when in government.  It is little wonder that by 1940, some 41% of the housing stock had been built by the State, benefiting a cross-section of the population with affordable rents.  It is a pity the vision of that time no longer exists.  Instead we have politicians so enthralled to their market solutions and neoliberal ideology that they cannot see the damage they are doing.<\/p>  <p>  We should be clear about what we are discussing.  Co-living is the nice name for it.  We are talking about 21st century tenements.  My father was born in a tenement.  He spent his life as an activist and continues as an activist and trade unionist.  He campaigned for the eradication of tenement housing and for the building of decent social housing.  He and his generation succeeded in that aim.  The slums were cleared and tenement housing was banished to being a relic of an old Ireland by the members of the Dublin Housing Action Committee.  What do we have in Ireland in 2020?  We have spivs and capitalists pushing 21st century tenements, just the same as they did in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  Is that what this Government, including the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, call progress?  It is 100 years since partition and the foundation of the 26-county State and this Government has decided to resurrect tenements.  It has learned nothing except how to line its pockets.<\/p>  <p>  These buildings can be painted in any bright colours, televisions can be put on the ceilings and all the mod cons can be added but that does not change the fact that 60 people living in bedrooms the size of parking spaces and sharing one kitchen is a modern day tenement.  My father and mother and people like Bernard and Betty Browne and all the activists of the Dublin Housing Action Committee fought to eradicate tenements and I am damned if I will stand here and allow the Government to let them go ahead for my grandson to live in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000048#YY00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1603222800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  What my party colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has proposed, is as timely as it is necessary.  Our Bill on co-living is clear in its ambition, namely to ban this type of building scheme.  This is a type of living arrangement that when he was in Opposition, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, called &quot;bonkers&quot;, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said.  When he became Minister, he could have initiated a ban but rather, he announced a review.  This neither here nor there response has emboldened those who wish to create such tenements.  Since then, we have seen an increase in the number of planning applications for these type of constructions.  His Government colleagues in the Green Party called it a profit-driven and inhumane model.  I have no doubt that people will be keen to see how the Green Party will vote on today's Bill.<\/p><p>I had the misfortune of living in shared co-living type accommodation in the past.  I would not wish it on my worst enemy.  It is not something we should be considering.  We need to get real here.  We cannot return to dodgy bedsits or the tenements of the past.  Working people deserve much better.  We need to build local authority homes, such as the type of homes some of us grew up in.  We also need to deliver real affordable homes, ones that are affordable for workers and their families.  When referencing co-living, the document, Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards For New Apartments, says that shared living:<\/p> <blockquote> \tComprises professionally managed rental accommodation, where individual rooms are rented within an overall development that includes access to shared or communal facilities and amenities. <\/blockquote>  <p>If one was to remove the words &quot;rental&quot; and &quot;rented&quot; from the above, it becomes hard to assess whether this is referring to a living complex for young professionals or the wing of a prison.  There was no need for a review.  There was a need for a ban on this type of living arrangement.<\/p><p>These developments push up the price of land.  They are expensive and one would only be provided with a private living space the size of a car park space.  Yesterday, the Government moved to level 5 restrictions to cope with the spread of the Covid-19 virus.  I am curious to know how this would work in a co-living space.  Would the residents be confined to their cells?<\/p><p>Another key aspect of the Bill is our desire to ban the substandard design of build to rent properties.  We were advised that a significant aspect of the build to rent sector is its ability to accelerate the delivery of new housing on a greater scale, which is welcome.  However, one must ask why renters are not afforded a high quality space to live in.  Why does a renter not have the additional floor space that those in other complexes are afforded?  Why does the maximum of 12 apartments per floor not apply to build to rent construction?  Why is the renter, who would pay high rent in an urban dwelling, only entitled to substandard living space?  If this Bill is implemented, it would protect renters and put an end to the co-living fiasco proposed by the previous Minister.  I urge Members of all parties and none to support Sinn F&eacute;in on this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000048#YY00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603222800,"counter":486,"content":"<p>Part of what this legislation does is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000.  It is worth asking why the planning laws were the way they were before the former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, changed them.  Why were decisions taken on a local basis?  They were taken on a local basis because local planners, councillors and authorities knew the communities which they were planning for the best.  They were best placed to make those decisions.  That has been significantly hollowed out since then.  To be honest, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not far off submitting applications on behalf of applicants themselves at this stage.  That is one issue.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is minimum sizes.  Why were there minimum sizes for accommodation?  There were minimum sizes because it was an agreed policy and objective that there was a certain minimum standard of living that people were expected to have.  Space was a crucial component of that.  These standards were there and anything below that was substandard.  What is being proposed, therefore, in lots of these co-living applications would have been considered substandard accommodation that was not suitable for any citizen or person for much of the last 20 years.  That is what we are looking at here.  That point has been made more than 1,300 times.<\/p>  <p>  They can be marketed with pictures of flat screen TVs and whatever but the reality is that these spaces that people are living in are little more than the size of a car parking space.  We have to think about how much personal space matters.  We are in the middle of a pandemic.  We must think about somebody self-isolating in such accommodation.  It is not much more than a cell.<\/p> <p>That person is stuck in a small room.  Does he or she risk going to the kitchen?  We will not always be living in a pandemic, but this is a good example that conveys how severely limiting and constricting such a space is.  We can talk about young professionals and so on, but if we concede on the principle that it is acceptable to confine people's living space to matchbox-sized rooms, that has a ripple effect right through the entire housing system, and before we know it, that is what is held as acceptable for anyone, or any family for that matter.  That is the road the Government is going down.  This is not the solution to unaffordable accommodation.  We need to see an awful lot more action on affordable accommodation.  There is nothing on cost rental and nothing on cost purchase.  We are still waiting for the Minister's scheme.<\/p> <p> I will make a final point on affordable housing.  It is certainly an issue in Cork, and I am sure it is an issue for many local authorities.  An awful lot of schemes are not viable because the Department is doing nothing about the debt attached to lands owned by local authorities.  That needs action.  If the Government were to deal with that, it would deliver much more real affordable housing than anything co-living will deliver.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000048#YY00400","speaker":"1460","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603223400,"counter":488,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Teachta &Oacute; Broin, for bringing this Bill before the House.

While in opposition, the Minister labelled co-living as \"bonkers\".  The current Taoiseach when in opposition referred to \"battery cage-type accommodation\".  It is not often I agree with the Minister or the Taoiseach on housing policy, but these are indeed strange times.  On 11 June last year, the Green Party produced a paper on co-living and co-housing, labelling the former \"inhumane and profit-driven\".  It was wrong then and it is wrong now.  The Green Party was in opposition then; it is in government now.  Co-living is still wrong and needs to be rectified.  The reason for co-living is not to cut the very long housing waiting lists; it is to maximise profits for developers by squeezing as many housing units as possible into small spaces.  While Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael may have a cosy relationship with developers, I urge the Green Party not to be tainted by association.<\/p>  <p>  In County Kildare the standard response from the council when I make a representation on behalf of a constituent requiring housing is that the council is dealing with 2007 and 2008.  That is 12 and 13 years ago, respectively.  That is a disgrace.  Everyone else will have to find a HAP tenancy.  HAP tenancies are like hen's teeth in Kildare.  Bad and all as the situation is in general, for single people HAP tenancies are even worse.  They cannot be found for single people.  Most often one is asked to go to the charity shop and buy a tent.<\/p>  <p>  Last Friday, I slept outdoors for Focus Ireland's Shine a Light sleep-out.  I commend the work of Focus Ireland and Housing Action Kildare, whose members between them raised over &euro;1,000 for Focus Ireland.  My experience gave me a tiny glimpse into the life of a rough sleeper.  The cold gets inside the body and it takes hours the next day coming in out of the cold to warm up.  Sounds are amplified, and I am sure nobody who sleeps rough ever gets a good night's sleep.  I felt safe.  I was in my back yard.  I ask Members to imagine what it is like trying to sleep in the constant danger of being on a public street.<\/p>  <p>  The only solution is to build public housing on public land and to ensure that homes are affordable for the poor.

We have heard about almost battery-cage living.  Members have said it straight; there is no need for a review.  Co-living needs to be banned.  The terms I keep hearing are \"substandard\" and \"not fit for purpose\", highlighted particularly in these pandemic times, when we all understand how important space is.  I imagine people who are forced to live in this substandard accommodation do not have any difficulty with bubbles.  They are involved in far more bubbles than they want.  That is not something we can stand for.  A ban is the only way this should be dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire spoke about the fact that local authorities are hamstrung.  In Louth County Council we have a major difficulty in that for even the local authority housing we have, we have no maintenance budget.  Combined with this, we are spending about &euro;1 million a year on servicing the loans on landbanks, some of which were bought at the height of the Celtic tiger boom on instruction from the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time.  Louth County Council has had these landbanks on its books since.  Nobody has ever crystallised the losses on them and there have been constant promises from Departments but never a solution.  In fairness, I spoke to the Minister about this and I believe he will hold a meeting with Louth County Council, to include councillors, elected representatives of all sorts and the council executive.  I suppose it is very difficult to arrange such a meeting in the current pandemic but we need to ensure it happens because this is what has us absolutely hamstrung.<\/p>  <p>  The only solution to the problem we have is to empower local authorities to do what was for many years, namely, build houses for the public on public land.  We are talking across the board of mixed developments.  We are talking about local authority housing, or council houses, and also affordable cost rentals for those who can afford to pay a fair rent but not necessarily the &euro;1,000, &euro;1,200, &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,600 one could be paying in urban Dundalk at this point.  If it were not for HAP and the extortionate amounts paid into that scheme, people would be completely without housing.  We accept the reality, but the problem is that HAP sets the baseline, so we have a completely dysfunctional system that needs to be fixed.  Affordable cost-rental accommodation, affordable mortgages and the building of council houses - those are the solutions.  We do not need these bonkers battery-cage living places.  This was said by people who are now in positions of power while they were in positions over here, so we need follow-through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000049#ZZ00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603223400,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for bringing forward this Bill and providing me with the opportunity to bring clarity to the issues raised.

Section 28 empowers the Minister with responsibility for housing to issue guidelines to planning authorities in respect of any of their planning functions, to which planning authorities must have regard.  The subsection it is proposed to delete, section 28(1C), enables guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28 to also include specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs, with which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must comply.  The Bill further proposes to repeal the build-to-rent and shared accommodation sections of the apartment guidelines for planning authorities, which were issued by the Minister under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Let us examine the implications of seeking to delete section 28(1C) of the Planning and Development Act.  This Bill would remove a legislative provision introduced to empower the Minister with responsibility for housing to ensure a consistent and integrated approach by all 31 local planning authorities, the three regional assemblies and An Bord Plean&aacute;la when implementing national planning policy in the performance of their functions.  To understand the full implications of the Bill's proposal, it is important to understand why subsection (1C) was introduced in the first place.  The Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015 amended section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 by introducing a new provision, section 28(1C), whereby, as part of the planning guidelines issued under section 28, a Minister may identify SPPRs with which planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in the exercise of their functions, must comply.<\/p> <p>The SPPR amendment was inserted concurrent to a 2015 review and update of apartment planning guidelines to replace 2007 apartment guidelines.  The review process had been prompted by the adoption of development plans in a number of local authority areas that sought either to set higher minimum standards than those at national level, as set out in the 2007 guidelines document, or set additional new standards on matters not addressed by the 2007 guidelines.  These actions, although well-intentioned, unilaterally departed from national guidance, which had been developed with expert input, and were assessed to have the effect of unnecessarily and unjustifiably increasing the cost of new apartment development, either rendering such developments unviable or adding costs ultimately borne by future occupants, whether purchasers or renters.<\/p> <p> By 2015, each of the four Dublin local authorities had different standards for apartment development, and in the case of three of them the standards departed from national guidelines.  Standards further varied around the country.  Given the emerging gap between housing demand and supply, the level of variation in one city and around the country was totally counterproductive, especially given the need to encourage greater efficiency and output from a relatively small construction industry.<\/p> <p> The 2015 apartment guidelines and subsequent updated 2018 apartment guidelines utilised the SPPR mechanism under section 28(1C) of the Planning and Development Act to ensure clarity and consistency in providing national minimum standards for apartment developments.  In 2019, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, independently assessed the impact of the 2018 apartment guidelines as contributing to reduction of between 10% and 20% in build costs in Dublin, or between &euro;28,000 and &euro;51,000, where applied to actual schemes.<\/p> <p> While the viability of urban apartment development continues to be challenged, section 28(1C) has contributed to a significant increase in apartment construction in recent years.  The total number of apartments completed nationally in 2015 was 673.  By 2019, the figure had increased more than fourfold to 3,550.  While undoubtedly several factors contributed to this, ensuring a consistent set of national planning guidelines played a significant role.<\/p> <p> The ability to specifically use SPPRs under section 28(1C) enables important distinction to be made between general content of ministerial guidelines, where there is scope for variation in application at local authority level, as opposed to the mandatory nature of specific aspects of guidance where it may be necessary to identify requirements that must be applied consistently.  This can arise, for example, with regard to design where there is need for local flexibility on a case-by-case basis.  However, where it involves a national development standard, such as minimum size of apartments, there should be no variation across local authority boundaries.<\/p> <p> This Bill would, therefore, remove a provision introduced to empower the Minister to ensure a nationally consistent approach to planning.  We could revert to the position that obtained in 2015 whereby there were four different apartment standards in each of the four Dublin local authorities.  Is Sinn F&eacute;in proposing that we return to that position?<\/p> <p> As I explained, section 28(1C) was introduced to remedy that very scenario.  It enables the Minister to ensure, where necessary, there can be national policies and standards for planning and development that may be applied to ensure a consistent regulatory approach across the administrative boundaries of all 31 planning authorities and at appeal or direct application stage to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This approach is essential to provide clarity to both public and private investment and ensure progress in the construction and development of projects through the planning system.  It enables the system to facilitate the delivery of outcomes with greater certainty and viability.<\/p> <p> The second provision of the Bill seeks to repeal by deletion specific sections of the build-to-rent and shared accommodation section of the apartment guidelines which is in direct conflict with the statutory role of the Minister to amend or revoke guidelines.  The Bill seeks to override the Minister and Government by assuming, on behalf of the Oireachtas through primary legislation, functions delegated by the Minister by statute under section 28 to issue, amend or revoke planning guidelines.  It is noted that it is not the purpose of the primary planning legislation to ban or preclude any specific class of development.  It does not do so, with the notable exception of section 37K of the planning Act that precludes planning permission for enabling the authorisation of nuclear fission power generation in Ireland, which is illustrative of the national scale and significance of the potential development and merits.<\/p> <p>  The Bill comes at a time when I am at an advanced stage of a review of shared accommodation co-living development, as provided for in the 2018 apartment planning guidelines.  I am currently considering a report from my officials in this regard and there is sufficient scope for me to amend or revoke the guidance in accordance with section 28 of the Planning and Development Acts, as amended.<\/p> <p> The Government's approach is to look at the evidence and how current policies are operating.  This continues to be monitored and assessed and will inform how the Government responds over this time.  It is opportune that we look at the policy in this context to consider the evidence and explore the rationale that underpins Government policy.<\/p> <p> This is another episode of Sinn Fein's solution of having our housing challenges resolved by soundbite.  It is another Bill of less than 100 words.  It would facilitate uncertainty and inconsistency in our planning code, with a different standard for every local authority.  No attempt was made to seek advice from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, nor was any meaningful research done.  It is the classic Sinn F&eacute;in populist way, rushed to gain maximum attention before the departmental review has been decided.<\/p> <p> This Bill, if passed, would increase building costs.  Minimum standards have reduced costs, a view endorsed by the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland.  The Bill would have the perverse effect of encouraging applications at lower standards, delivering lower quality developments at increased cost.  Only Sinn F&eacute;in could achieve that.  The Bill would not in any way do what it proposes to do.  It would remain open for anyone to make a planning application for a co-living or build-to-rent development without any national guidelines.  The contradictions seem endless.  This Bill tries to undermine the Government's power to make decisions and blurs the lines between the Oireachtas and Government.  It would leave any administration responding to challenges of the day with one hand tied behind its back.<\/p> <p> Normally, proposals to amend or revoke planning guidelines are on the basis of expert advice, subject to public consultation and screened by a strategic environmental assessment.  However, in the case of Sinn F&eacute;in, 100 words seem sufficient.  It is another week and we have another reckless three-line Bill presented by Sinn F&eacute;in in the absence of scrutiny by this House.  The Government will oppose the Bill for the reasons I have set out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000049#ZZ01400","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603224000,"counter":503,"content":"<p>I support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's proposals.  I find it hard to believe anyone in this House could believe that co-living is the right way to develop our housing stock.  Co-living is not cheap.  It costs around &euro;1,300 per month for what is, effectively, a car parking space, with 40 people sharing a kitchen.  At the best of times, co-living is not suitable but at the height of a pandemic, it is completely unacceptable.  These are tenements for the future.  They are certainly not boutique living, as they were previously described by a Fine Gael Minister with responsibility for housing.  The cost of land gets pushed up because developers use the site to wedge in bedrooms.  There are developments on the old Kiely's site in Donnybrook and in Harold's Cross.  Right across the city, hotels, aparthotels and student accommodation are springing up everywhere without any issues.  For working families and homeless families and individuals, however, homes are not being built and those that are built are not affordable.  Clearly, something is wrong when we cannot build housing that does not address the needs of the housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  We have a developer-led housing policy.  We have 4,000 co-living beds in the system because developers will maximise their profits at the expense of families and individuals who are being forced to live in completely overcrowded accommodation.  We need to repeal the Planning and Development Act that gives the Minister the power to introduce mandatory planning guidelines without a vote in the Oireachtas.  This provision was introduced by the Labour Party in 2016 and needs to go.  Sinn F&eacute;in would also repeal the mandatory planning guidelines introduced by Fine Gael not long ago.  It should be noted that these are the same guidelines and regulations that have allowed developers to chance their arm to try to build 15-storey buildings in Ringsend next to one-storey and two-storey schools.  Thankfully, Dublin City Council has rejected this.  It is important that An Bord Plean&aacute;la does the same.  We need affordable homes and public housing on public land, not co-living developments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000050#AAA00200","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1603224600,"counter":504,"content":"<p>I represent one of the oldest parts of Dublin, the Liberties, which has one of the most historic inner-city communities.  It is extolled, sung about and maybe sentimentalised but it is a great community.  It is neglected and has been overlooked by successive Governments.  This marginalised area watched as the Celtic Tiger passed it by and then it was one of the places hardest hit in the subsequent recession.  All the while, greedy speculators were enforcing dereliction on the local community, on people's homes, roads and lanes.  Then, when the building started, it was not homes for the locals that were planned but, rather, the \"studentification\" of the area by means of the foisting of blocks upon blocks of student accommodation on an unsuspecting host community.<\/p>  <p>  It was not just student accommodation.  It was also a plethora of hotels, one after another.  There followed the latest trend for developers and their vulture fund backers to squeeze the biggest profit from a site: co-living.  Here we are in the middle of a housing crisis, and where are the homes?  Where are the houses for local people in circumstances where the housing lists are growing?  All that is being built around them are co-living units, student accommodation and hotels.  This change in the Liberties and other inner-city communities in Dublin and other cities has been facilitated by the planners, and by successive Ministers since the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, made the disgraceful decision to facilitate co-living builds throughout the State.  Of course the previous Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, championed them also.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has a chance to change tack before further destruction is done to the fabric of this city and the communities that live in it.  The Minister of State should support this Bill or he, too, will be remembered as part of the gang who wrecked our city.  He will be just as guilty of trying to hollow out the soul of the city and facilitating the selling of the commercial product which co-living now is.  Living in dog boxes, with 40 bedrooms sharing one kitchen, is being suggested in the most recent scheme planned for Halston Street in Dublin's north inner city.  The slum landlord who subdivided his property to have a similar number of migrant workers in a house in Crumlin last year was rightly condemned but the same standards apply.  Being nicely painted and having a modern bed in it does not make the dog box any bigger.  A dog box is a dog box no matter how one dresses it up.

The Minister of State's Government colleagues from my area, the Minister Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman, and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, both vehemently opposed the co-living development at the former Brady's site in Castleknock.  My belief was that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, abstained previously and he was playing politics with this.  I believe that will be proven in the next couple of days.  However, I thought the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was made of different stuff and find it disappointing that he did not turn up tonight to explain to the people of Blanchardstown and Castleknock why he would be voting down this Bill tomorrow.  On 9 January he said that the decision is completely the fault of Fine Gael's housing policies and also there has been no thought put into the co-living model.<\/p>  <p>  I will briefly outline the co-living development at what was formerly Brady's Castleknock Inn.  It is on the site of a former house and is surrounded by semi-detached two-storey houses of the sort one would find in every single estate in suburban areas in Dublin 15.  This multistorey development will be completely out of character with its surrounding environment.  It will consist of 210 units and there is not one single car park space.  There are two drop-off spaces, but where are the hundreds of people who are going to live here park their cars?  It is going to clog up the streets of the surrounding area.  The reality is that these developments will become temporary halfway houses for people seeking better accommodation.  The population will be temporary and transient and will severely impact on the local community surrounding it.  There are many reasons to oppose this.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that these developments would not even be considered if we had a functioning housing market.

I have no argument with their assessment that co-living is both grotesque and inhumane and is, in the main, profit-driven.  There has been a housing crisis in Ireland for many years, irrespective of which Government was in place.  The housing crisis is a reflection of the poor housing policies that have been in place for decades and of each Government's over-reliance on the private sector to solve the housing problem.<\/p>  <p>  It seems now that the new remedy for solving crisis, the response to years of failures in our broken housing system, is co-living.  The reality behind this new thinking is, however, that it is an unfortunate reflection of the true state of housing in Ireland, in that there is a total lack of supply of affordable and quality housing.  This is not necessarily going to change with co-living developments.  Such developments have adversely affected land prices by grossly inflating them because of the perceived potential for high returns for such developments.  In a study on co-living, one English academic described it as purely a new way for developers to squeeze profit from an already broken housing market.  This seems to perfectly describe the current situation in Ireland.  I believe that co-living will also have a negative impact on society, both on social cohesion and on the development of communities.  Co-living is being touted as a solution to the housing crisis but it is just a cynical attempt to cash in on it.  We do not need overpriced co-living developments to solve the housing or rental crises.  The solution is to build more social and affordable housing.  Government Members should support this Bill and not make lame excuses about breaking the rules and how there are constitutional reasons which prevent them from supporting this.  Government Deputies in the past indicated that they would support this and have described it in the manner I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000051#BBB00300","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1603224600,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I must tell the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, that the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, was one of the more disappointing ones I have heard in this House since February.  We live in an age where one would hope that the ordinary to and fro and over and back of party-political jibing would perhaps be put to one side when there are greater issues at stake.  There have been moments of great clarity from Government over a number of issues and in its ability to reach across the aisle and work with the Opposition.  Even with the Dying with Dignity Bill, there was a suggestion from Government that it was possible to take the politics out of this and work on a committee-based structure for 12 months or so to try to advance the aims.  It was not a perfect suggestion but at least it was an acknowledgement that there was some validity in what the Opposition was putting forward.  Indeed, even with Labour's proposal on sick pay, the Government's response was that it would look into the idea for six months.  That is certainly not ideal but it is not a rejection.<\/p>  <p>  What we did not get from the Government contributions in those debates was what we got this evening from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, which was so lacking in empathy and did not speak to any human experience whatever.  It started off with a couple of political jibes.  It rattled off a load of constitutional this and that and ended with a political jibe.  Nowhere in it was there any mention of what type of person or living conditions does the Government feel are appropriate.  If the Minister of State or the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government's position want to say: \"Yes, we understand your concerns about co-living because we share them and because previous to the election we said some things which you have quoted to us this evening and you are right, we did describe them as bonkers, we did describe them as tenements.  We are going to work with Opposition to ensure we can, at the very least, put a halt to any new co-living applications\", that is fine.<\/p> <p>We did not get that, however.  We got a presentation from the Government that was, I feel, lacking in any real sense of dealing in a fair manner with what has been proposed in Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.<\/p> <p> Of course Opposition Bills are not perfect and of course they need to be amended.  Fundamentally, what we are speaking about is a housing standard.  Even before the pandemic, this type of living did not make much sense as a proposal to deal with the housing crisis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, knows that poverty and disease are often, if not always, exacerbated by housing conditions.  TB in the 1940s has been mentioned when 4,000 people died a year.  It affected every family in Dublin.  The word \"tenement\" still resonates in a very negative way and sends a shiver down the spine of many Dubliners because of the muscle memory evoked by that word and where our families came from and how we lived.  We improved on it.  We built public housing on public land and we moved away from this type of accommodation.  Now, in my constituency and in the area from where our housing spokesperson, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, comes, co-living proposals are coming to the fore.  There is one in Clare Hall for 122 co-living units.  It has gone straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because the previous Government's strategic housing development legislation totally overrides the local authority.  Applications go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that is where the decisions are made.  It totally overrides the democratically constituted development plan of the city.<\/p> <p> Any number of housing solutions have been put forward by the Opposition in the previous Oireachtas and in this Oireachtas.  The Green Party has a very strong record on sustainable housing and sustainable planning.  Green Party councillors have a strong record of overseeing decency in public life when it comes to constructing these development plans.  My party is the same.  When it comes to a proposal for co-living housing, being so defensive and having such a defensive presentation from the Government as we did really belittles what we are trying to discuss.  We are trying to discuss how people can live in a sustainable way.  Many things that were untouchable in the past are being mentioned, such as the nationalisation of private hospitals, a sustainable basic universal income and a ban on evictions.  We were told all of these were constitutionally questionable but they were all able to happen overnight because the pandemic demanded it.  The pandemic demands that we have a higher standard of housing and it demands that a proposal such as co-living, which was always a bad idea anyway, should be absolutely ruled out in the current situation.  If the Government felt strongly enough about it what we would have had this evening was a strong and robust speech from the Minister of State that told us the Government would meet us half way.  The Minister of State would have said that he knew and had heard that the legislation was imperfect but that he understood from the history of the city that this type of proposal is not one the Government could stand over and that it would make sure in whatever way it possibly could that it would not proceed.  He would have said that the Government regretted the applications being made but would try to do its best to go beyond a situation where co-living is deemed to be acceptable.  We did not get this.<\/p> <p> When it comes to the vote on this, Government Deputies will vote the way they do, and I was once that soldier.  When we walk away from the debate we will be in no way clearer as to where the compassion is in terms of the Government's housing policy.  This is the real disappointment about this evening.  Anybody can rattle off a speech that is spiteful and full of political point-scoring rhetoric.  The people who might potentially live in this type of accommodation, and who may be forced to live in this type of accommodation, demand better from the Parliament and this political discourse.<\/p> <p> Can we all accept across the House that co-living is not a solution?  Can we accept we have a problem right here and right now whereby co-living planning applications are being submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  Can we accept this is a difficulty?  Can we accept we should have higher housing standards for our people?  Can we say we have learned the lessons of history in terms of tenement life, TB and typhoid?  I am not trying to be overly emotive.  I am not trying to be unfair.  These are the lessons of history.  Housing policy is dictated by the mistakes that were made and that we promised would not happen again.  Tenement living, which many families know about, came from a situation where the property and landlord classes ran the show.  We cannot return to that situation.<\/p> <p> I and the Labour Party appeal to the Minister of State and his Government colleagues.  The Government could easily dismiss the type of legislation proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Broin as playing politics, and it did, or it could find the good, the decency and the ethic behind what is being proposed as something worthy of support.  Perhaps the Government will not support the Bill in the vote when it takes place but it could contextualise it by giving some hope to the Opposition and others in our society that this type of housing standard is not something it really wants to stand over and that will take steps to ensure it will curtail it, regulate it or ensure it does not spread any more than it already has.  This is the message we want to hear from the Government.  The type of speech that was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, really was quite depressing and ill-befitting a debate on a type of housing model that is not worthy of our citizens.  The Government should do better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000051#BBB00400","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603225200,"counter":509,"content":"<p>It is regrettable that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, made his contribution and then left straight away.  We now have a situation that neither Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael are present in the Chamber but it is Fine Gael that is the architect of co-living and Fianna F&aacute;il that holds the senior Ministry.  It is a pity they have left the Green Party here to defend a policy of which I am not sure it is too supportive, although its members will speak for themselves in time.  It is regrettable that we do not have the Minister with responsibility for housing or the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government in the Chamber.  Instead we have the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform.  This is a pattern and I have seen it happen before.  It needs to be called out.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, made particular comments.  Most of his contribution was about defending section 28 and the ministerial guidelines.  I have major problems with section 28 and the ministerial guidelines.  These measures were introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, and they are highly regressive and backward.  Effectively what they are about is overruling democracy.  They allow a Minister without any recourse to the D&aacute;il, or any proper accountability, debate or vote, to issue planning guidelines that overrule planning standards and decisions that could be made at local authority level.  It undermines local democracy and the role of the D&aacute;il.  We should not stand over it.  They need to go and the Bill is correct in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the argument that apartment standards were harmonised under the guidelines introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, the industry lobbied very heavily for the introduction of those reductions in apartment standards and made the case that if they were introduced apartments would then be affordable and viable.<\/p> <p>This year before the budget, the industry argued for a shared equity scheme, saying that if its building costs were subsidised through such a scheme, apartment building would be viable, affordable and so forth.  Every year the industry states that if X, Y and Z are done for it, apartment building will be viable and affordable, and every year the Government makes changes, and we are back at square one.  It has not been an effective route to address those issues.<br\/><br\/>It is ironic that the Minister is not present because he was incredibly vocal about co-living in opposition.  He told his predecessor, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, that if they liked the idea of co-living so much, they should try living in it.  I wonder whether the Minister wants to apply that advice to himself.  He also stated that his big concern was that this type of facility would become the norm and he was correct in that analysis, and that co-living units would push up the price of normal apartments in addition to co-living box apartments and he was correct about that too.  He said they were not trendy boutique hotels but boxes, and that we needed to consider amendments to the Planning and Development Act 2000 to prevent more being built, and he was correct in that.<br\/><br\/>More recently, during the summer the Minister reiterated that he was not a fan of co-living.  He stated he was reviewing the issue but that it was not an immediate threat because no such projects had been built.  He was wrong in that, however, because they are very much a threat and there has been an escalation in the number of planning applications submitted.  He stated he thought the market would sort out the issue and that people would decide for themselves if they did not consider co-living a solution for housing, but he is completely wrong on that.  The market is dictating that it is the most cost-effective way for a developer to get the maximum return from land, which is why the market is going in this direction.  The Minister told us in the Chamber in July that it was his intention to return to the House in the autumn and to work in consultation with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage whenever it was established.  The committee has been established and a good number of its members are present.  We would like to work with the Minister on this.  It is now the autumn, although it will be finished in 11 days.  The Government has not requested any time in the House to discuss co-living, despite the Minister's assurances in July and August that he would do so.  The only discussion of it is taking place as a result of the Bill, which has been brought forward by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and unfortunately neither the Minister nor the Minister of State directly involved is present for the discussion on it at this point.<br\/><br\/>When co-living was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, he stated: <\/p><blockquote>\tWhat we are trying to do is cater to a very small part of the market.  The demand is small but there is still demand.  If over the next 12 months, 1% of new builds in this country provide for co-living, it will take between 200 and 250 people. <\/blockquote> <p>His rationale for this, therefore, was that co-living would comprise a very small part of the market, and that is also what he said in his media performances on the issue.  Now, however, more than 5,000 co-living units are in the planning process.  It is creating a race to the bottom in standards and an incentive for developers to push for co-living or build-to-rent to maximise their returns.  This, in turn, is increasing land costs, making the provision of standard apartments much more costly and less viable.<br\/><br\/>As other Deputies have noted, the size of co-living units, including an en suite bathroom, is just 12 sq. m, the size of a parking space.  This is three times smaller than the smallest studio-type apartments, which must be a minimum of 37 sq. m for just one person.  When studio apartments were brought in, we were told they would be a small portion of the market to cater for a small group of people, and now there is co-living on top of that.  To put the 12 sq. m in context, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment has stated prison cells need to be at least 7 sq. m.  A co-living unit is not even double the minimum acceptable standard for a prison cell.  That is what we are talking about here.<br\/><br\/>We have to learn from Covid and one of the lessons has to be that it is essential for everyone to have access to a minimum decent standard of living space.  We know that infections spread fast in crowded conditions where people rely on communal facilities such as co-living.  This is just one of the reasons this type of accommodation should be abolished now and why it was abolished in the past in this country, as Deputy O'Reilly correctly noted.  She referred to the great work done by her father, Mick O'Reilly, and others involved on the Dublin housing action committee to get these types of accommodation abolished for health and other reasons in the past.<br\/><br\/>More and more people, in future years when the pandemic has finished, although there could be other pandemics, will live and work from home, and co-living is utterly unsuitable in that regard.  The rents that will be charged for co-living will be unaffordable, and the reports submitted as part of the planning application process by Bartra Capital Property Group have predicted that rents will be charged at approximately &euro;1,300 per month for effectively one room.  If one thinks about how that compares with a shared room in a house, one will see how outrageously high such rents are.  They will have an overall effect of increasing rents across the board in the private rented sector.<br\/><br\/>We are now seeing, particularly in Dublin, the effects of the policies of the previous Government, as more and more hotels, student accommodation, co-living and build-to-rent are being built.  Co-living will not be a choice; it will become a tenure where people will be stuck for years, unable to afford other options, especially as it will undermine the supply of other types of rental accommodation.  Instead of building liveable cities with high-quality amenities, public transport, public spaces, a city that is safe and high-quality accommodation in which to live, we see the commodification and the financialisaton of housing, where the aim seems to be to provide financial instruments and investments for people rather than high-quality accommodation.<br\/><br\/>We need to ban the advertising of short-term lets, which are operating without planning permission in our cities, and provide more rental accommodation; ban co-living and build-to-rent; bring in compulsory purchase orders of land to build up public land banks to reduce the cost of development land and of construction; and ensure a good supply of apartments and homes that are affordable to rent and buy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000052#CCC00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603225800,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I am sharing time.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill gives the impression that someone cares about where people live.  Co-living has, to date, been classed as substandard and applications have been turned down by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on more than one occasion.  There is a shortfall in the provision of floor space, with an equal shortfall in respect of the kitchen and the shared space, but this could be a very costly mistake for the Government.  In June 2019, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused permission to Bartra Capital Property Group for a co-living development in Tallaght.  It was turned down on the grounds that there would not be enough space.  None of this was viewed in light of Covid-19, which arrived after the planning was turned down.<\/p>  <p>  I have worked in construction all my life.  To put co-living in context, the requirement means roughly 11'6\" sq. ft, which is the length of two arms in each direction.  Seven such units could fit into a three-bedroom semi-detached house.  That is what the current co-living standards mean.  Since I became first a councillor and now a Deputy, I have said one-bedroom apartments should never be built, because if somebody gets sick or needs to be cared for, a second bedroom at least will be needed.  At a minimum cost of 13% of the value of building a one-bedroom property, a two-bedroom property can be built, but the Government is not listening to me on this.<\/p> <p>If the Government wants to resolve the housing crisis and help people, there are other ways of doing it.  There are people who are reaching retirement age or whose families are deceased and who want to downsize to nice two-bedroom apartments in good areas where it is safe.  Their current homes could be used to house others when they make the move to downsize.<\/p> <p> The Government is not allowing for any of that.  It wants to herd people into boxes.  That is what the Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens wants to do.  That is not the way forward.  We have seen from Covid-19 that it is not the way forward.  We have seen from what is happening in colleges that it is not the way forward because of the outbreaks among those living on campus.  If it is not working in the real world, why would the Government try to make it work in a make-believe world?<\/p> <p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la has turned this down on more than one occasion.  Will the Government not listen to the experts and stop trying to rush through something without thinking about it and having a proper debate?  Listen to those who know what they are talking about and make a future for people to allow them to plan, live and work in a safe environment.  The properties that are left will be left to others in order that they can move on to something better.<\/p> <p> The only people who will profit from this are those who have small areas of land that they consider valuable and who want to put as much stuff onto it as they can in order to get the most profit out of it.  They do not care who is living there.  If one bad tenant is put into one of these, there are 12 more living around him or her and the right infrastructure is not in place to control what happens.  We have seen in different places where a person who engages in antisocial behaviour goes into a housing estate and how long it takes to sort matters out.  How long will it take to resolve something like this if one person goes into the wrong apartment, or the wrong room because it is not an apartment?<\/p> <p> The Government should listen and it should learn that what has been done in the past did not work.  We need to build for the future and the next generation.  The way to do that is by building units for people who want to retire into a safe environment and then we can open up other areas in order to meet housing need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000053#DDD00200","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603226400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I am sharing time.

When a person is young and starting out, the type of accommodation he or she requires is not what he or she will require a couple of years after that when they get the legs under them.  We all want to see everybody having their own front door, whether that is a privately owned house, a local authority house or in whatever accommodation they can afford - in a proper fashion and of the type and size they want.  That is what we aspire to people having but they will not have it at the beginning of their working lives because everybody has to put up with things.  Everybody has to have a place that is comfortable but that might not be 100% what they would want because it might not be their own.  You work and you keep working.

A few years ago, I think it was the second to last Government that got rid of bedsits in Dublin.  That is when the housing problem became exacerbated in the city.  We did not have that problem.  Bedsits, as I understand it, are or were in cities.  A single man or woman rented such a place to tide him or her over, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, at a certain stage in their lives.  When those people moved on and got into a family situation, they needed a bigger house.<\/p>  <p>  It is amazing to think that the Government is considering going backwards and building apartments that are not much bigger than butter boxes.  If we are to move forward, we must improve.  From reading everything and listening to everyone, I think that the Minister was against this type of living space when he was in opposition but now he is in favour of it.  It is hard to understand what is going on.  Different things happen when people get into government and they forget what got them there in the first place.<\/p>  <p>  In County Kerry, we do not have a problem with this but we have many people trying to put a roof over their own heads who are being stopped by serial objectors.  I appeal to the Government to do something about these serial objectors because they have stopped many people who just wanted one thing, namely, to get planning to build a house legally for themselves and put a roof over their heads.  They were not stopped by the council.  Maybe the rules and regulations were tough but, in many cases, local authorities granted planning permission.  However, their decisions were appealed by serial objectors, An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned them down and the people involved lost the chance of putting a roof over their heads in the places they wanted to do so.  I am glad I got to say that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000054#EEE00500","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1603226400,"counter":517,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this motion.  It brings into stark focus some of the issues relating to the housing sector.  It is important that we try and deal with these issues individually and comprehensively.  I will focus on two of them.<\/p>  <p>  The Government and the Opposition, public representatives across the country and community representatives are all in this together.  We are all in this together except, that is, the providers of student accommodation.  It is not just those who provide student accommodation on a private basis - some of the universities are also not in it with everyone else.<\/p> <p>They have turned their backs on many students across the country who have paid substantial deposits for accommodation and have been told they are not getting their money back even though they cannot utilise the accommodation because of the Covid-19 restrictions that are in place.  There was an appalling example involving the University of Limerick, which had to be dragged kicking and screaming to refund the accommodation costs to its students before the summer.  It eventually, begrudgingly, paid over that money.<\/p> <p> Quite a number of private providers refused point blank to refund money to students.  They were not in it together with those students.  They came cap in hand to the Government for restart grants, access to the wage subsidy scheme and pandemic unemployment payment for their employees because they had a drop in income as a result of there being no student or summer rental owing to the lack of tourism during the summer.  I find it immoral that the Government paid them and that they, in turn, did not pay the students.<\/p> <p> We are in a similar situation again.  I have a representation from a constituent, a young man who paid a first instalment of &euro;3,500 for his accommodation, whose course will be provided online this semester.  That private provider has pocketed the money.  These private providers are not only availing of financial supports at the moment but also of tax incentives.  Tax relief is being claimed by approximately 200 student accommodation providers across the country.  In 2017, 246 providers claimed relief from the Revenue Commissioners.  They got tax relief from the State and taxpayers across the country to build student accommodation in the first place.  Some of them even had the sites handed to them.  Yet, when they are asked by the Minister for Education and Skills, the Government and representatives of the people of this country to give students a break, they were not in it together with the rest of us.  They quickly turned their backs on those students.  There is now an onus on the Government.  These providers have refused point blank, after repeated requests from Government, to refund students.  They should not be eligible, under any circumstances, for Covid-19 supports.  We should look at a clawback of any tax incentives that they have got when they are not prepared to stand together with the people of Ireland.<\/p> <p> I raise the issue of the churning of housing.  I represent a bizarre constituency, the most rural one in the country.  We have ample vacant housing in parts of my constituency.  There are housing estates with tumbleweed going through them.  In other parts of my constituency, we have a serious housing supply issue and a housing crisis.  If a constituent comes to me having been given notice to leave their house in Roscommon town, Ballinsaloe or Monksland in Athlone, an absolute dread comes over me and them because there is no accommodation available at any price of which they can avail.  This churning of accommodation is forcing families unnecessarily into homelessness.  <\/p> <p> I find it frustrating that we have security of tenure in this country for cows in fields but not for children in homes.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, knows well that there is a measure in place within the agricultural sector that provides a tax incentive for the long-term leasing of farmland but there is no similar structure for housing.  In the 1990s, the vast majority of farmland in this country was leased on an 11-month basis.  The argument was made at the time that farmers could not plan for the future on an 11-month lease.  The Government of the day brought in a tax allowance to incentivise farmers who were leasing land to do it on a five-year basis.  Additional incentives were subsequently brought in for ten and up to 15 years.  As a result of that, more than 50% of all land that is being leased in this country today is leased on a long-term basis.  That provides security for the farmer who is leasing the land because they know they have it for a period of time at a certain rate and they can plan into the future.  While we are prepared to put structures in place for farmers to plan the management of cattle and farmland into the future, we are refusing point-blank to do the same for children and families by guaranteeing them a home and roof over their heads.<\/p> <p> I am not talking about bringing in an incentive for large-scale landlords.  They have done very well from incentives that have been put in place - far too well, to be honest.  I am talking about accidental landlords who own one, possibly two, homes.  We should provide them with encouragement to enter a five, ten or 15-year lease with a family to provide some level of security for them.  The reality is that some families are not going to be in a position to buy a house themselves.  They will not be in a position, in the foreseeable future, to get a local authority house because, with the best will and construction programme in the world, it will take a period of time before those houses are available.  The least we should be able to do is to guarantee those families a roof over their heads this year, next year and the year after that.  It happens all over continental Europe.  It happens for farms in Ireland so why can it not happen to provide roofs over the heads of children?  We must ensure that this churning of rental property becomes a thing of the past.  It is probably the biggest vehicle causing homelessness of families today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000054#EEE00600","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603227000,"counter":519,"content":"<p>I call on the Independent Group.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and commend Deputy &Oacute; Broin for bringing it forward.<\/p><p>In July 2019, then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, tried to tell the Irish public that co-living was like living in a &quot;very trendy kind of boutique hotel-type place&quot;.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>of Saturday, 20 July 2019, reported that one Opposition Deputy's response was that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThey should scrap co-living.  If Leo Varadkar and Eoghan Murphy want this bonkers policy so much, they should co-live together.  <\/blockquote>  <p>Fast forward a year and the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy who uttered those words about the bonkers policy is now the Minister in charge of the Department and responsible for the decisions it makes.<\/p> <p>Surely Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, the Minister responsible for housing, local government and heritage in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, would and should use his power to undo this bonkers policy?  Is that not why he is in politics?<br\/><br\/>In another article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>in July last year, it was reported that, &quot;Fianna F&aacute;il housing spokesperson Darragh O'Brien insisted law changes are needed to block further co-living builds&quot;.  The article quotes him as saying, &ldquo;The decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is deeply disappointing, and the big concern now is that these types of facilities will now become the norm&quot;.  The now Minister is further quoted as stating:<\/p><blockquote>\tCo-living units will have no effect on housing, and they will push up the price of &quot;normal&quot; apartments in addition to co-living &quot;box&quot; apartments.  They are not trendy boutique hotels, they are boxes, and we need to consider amendments to the 2000 Planning Act to change the regulations and stop more from being built. <\/blockquote> <p>Does the Minister not mean what he says, or should we just disregard anything he said when in opposition?  If the Minister had such strong convictions about bonkers co-living units when in opposition, why commission a review when he has the ministerial power to put an end to them?<br\/><br\/>In 2017, the then Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, paved the way for co-living units and build to rent to become a new norm in a dysfunctional private rental market.  In a Rebuilding Ireland press statement of December 2017, the then Minister stated that new guidance had been provided:<\/p><blockquote>\ton a new form of shared and serviced rental accommodation &ndash; so called &ldquo;build-to-rent and shared accommodation or co-living&rdquo;, increasingly being sought by the many tech-sector and new economic enterprises drawn to the centres of our cities and towns.  We believe that a new additional code for this emerging demand, could unlock major investment in rental accommodation that is being demanded by the thousands of workers coming in to our growing economy, and which, while very positive for the overall economy, is adding to the pressure in the rental market. <\/blockquote> <p>The Minister stated in 2017 that tech companies and businesses, not renters, young workers or voters, were asking for this option.  Of course, developers and construction companies want to build twice or three times as many units in any given development to maximise their profits and, in some cases, charge &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month for a unit the size of a car-parking space, as was said by many Members in this debate.  <br\/><br\/>The premise of co-living units is that there are shared common spaces, such as kitchen areas and living room areas, and they are aimed at a high-end, young, mobile and international workforce.  While co-living was bonkers in pre-Covid times, it is certainly much more bonkers and, indeed, dangerous now.  People have been asked to self-isolate and quarantine in their own homes, if they are lucky enough to have one.  How does the Minister propose that this would be possible in co-living units?  We have already been told that Covid will be with us for many years and co-living will just exacerbate the problem.<br\/><br\/>While companies like Node, the first company to bring co-living to Ireland, shares beautiful photos of high-end apartment living, with all of the designer appliances, the public in Irish cities and, indeed, our planning departments in city and county councils, are not necessarily convinced.  Moreover, this is no longer the booming economy of pre-Covid times.<br\/><br\/>In June, Dublin City Council granted permission for a co-living development of 116 units at Mountjoy Street.  Almost a third of the units are planned to be between 15 and 18 sq. m in size.  Media reports in August showed that in the initial city council report from the planning officer, there were grave concerns over the usability and functionality of the bedroom spaces and it stated that in most cases, the rooms were only 3 m wide resulting in long and narrow bedrooms with a corridor covering an extensive part of the room with little usable space.<br\/><br\/>Further information was requested from the builder on the usability of the bedrooms with regard to circulation versus usable space and to clarify whether there was sufficient storage in each bedroom.  Concerns were expressed around the usability and quality of the kitchen spaces and how the accommodation would be managed.  However, once this information was clarified, planning permission was then granted.<br\/><br\/>Co-living and unaffordable build-to-rent units were bonkers before this global pandemic but they are certainly dangerous now.  People need safe, secure, liveable, spaces with all amenities available to them and at an affordable price.  How many of our Googlers, Facebookers, tech workers and others have returned to their home countries to work remotely from there during this pandemic?  Will the belated review include this development?  I will be supporting this Bill and urge the Minister and Government to accept it, especially now that a suite of regulations is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000055#FFF00500","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603227600,"counter":524,"content":"<p>Various quotes have been mentioned and I will start with one.  Just over a year ago, on 15 October 2019, ago the following observation was made at the housing committee, \"I do not support co-living at all, as it is not a solution or even a partial solution, to our housing problem.\"  I have made the point many times that we have to make language mean something if we want to work to restore integrity to politics and want people to believe in us.  Nobody ever asked us to be perfect but they asked us to say what we mean so that they know where they stand.<\/p>  <p>  I have looked at the Bill.  It is short and to the point.  The Minister of State is in the House.  As has been said, it is unfortunate that he took the approach that he did.  I see the difficulty with the Bill from the Government's point of view, given that it proposes to repeal all of the relevant legislation.  However, the Minister of State noted that the regulations were brought in to have nationally consistent high standards.  It seems to me that is not what has happened.  Broad regulation has allowed low standards to be introduced and has copper-fastened them at very high prices.  Language is again being stood on its head.<\/p>  <p>  Previous Governments commodified homes and the current Government has inherited this situation.  The challenge now is for the Government to do something different because that is why it is in office.  I and other Opposition Deputies were elected because we said we would do things differently and make our word mean something.  It is time to stop commodifying homes.  They are not a commodity. <\/p>  <p>  We cannot take part in society if we do not have security of tenure.  I do not agree with Deputy Naughten on security of tenure being ten or 15 years.  People need a home for life.  We need the Government to be in the middle of the market, i l&aacute;r an aonaigh.  We need to send a message out that a home is essential.  It is the most basic thing we need before we can live a civilised life.  The State needs to be in the middle of that and build public housing on public land.  It is as simple as that.  The Government has to grasp the nettle and we will support that.  That is what we have to do, regardless of whether the Government likes it.  We need public housing on public land.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to Galway and the locked out of the market study.  The Simon Community has done us a great service for a long time in making a pen picture of the market at a given time.  On 20 August, it found that in three areas there were no properties available to rent in any category within the standard of the discretionary rent supplement and the housing assistance payment.  Those areas were Galway city, Limerick city and Portlaoise.  In my city, people inexplicably have been on social housing waiting lists for over 15 years and have never been offered a house.  I have no idea how that could happen when land is available.<\/p>  <p>  The report published by Daft confirmed that Galway has bucked all the trends and in three months, rent has increased by 10%, which is 3% per month, a figure which is out of sync with all of Connacht and Ulster.  We have a housing crisis.  The Government should declare that and let the solutions emerge.  One of them is public housing on public land.<\/p>  <p>  Galway city is developer-led.  I ask the Minister of State to have a look at it.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, agreed with me twice on the record.  We have public land and developer-led developments. <\/p>  <p>  Ceannt Station is a development on public land being led by a developer.  The docks is doing its own thing.  Sandy Road and the university are doing something else.  It is all separate.  In one sense, I say fair play to those involved because the obligation is on the city council and Government to work in the common good and have a master plan.  There is no master plan.  It is enshrined in the city development plan that it will be facilitated, but they cannot afford to produce one.  They cannot afford not to produce one because we will have an unsustainable city.<\/p>  <p>  It upsets me to see the term \"sustainable\" in planning guidelines that allow for a co-living with a bedroom of 12 sq. m.

I fully agree with the sentiment of the Private Member's Bill on co-living and acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has also publicly expressed his aversion to this type of accommodation.<\/p> <p>Throughout the programme for Government negotiations my colleagues and I called for the abolition of co-living.  This was unfortunately not included in the programme for Government.  While a market does exist for models of co-living, including student and corporate units, there is a real fear that current policy will create glorified youth hostels as a means to end the housing crisis.  I also repeated my conviction during the negotiations that build-to-rent strategic housing developments, SHDs, inflate rental costs.  It is not a sustainable model for renters and does not benefit communities.  <\/p> <p> In some cases along the Dublin commuter belt, housing does not meet the core strategies of current national, regional and local development plans.  This State should not be complicit in these housing models.  However, I understand that clarity is being sought on how An Bord Plean&aacute;la is using the SHD guidelines in order that planning permissions meet current core development plan strategies.  The current system only serves to create transient workforces and non-sustainable communities and lacks fair and transparent public participation.  The State should only provide homes that are sustainable, equitable for society and built with future generations in mind.  <\/p> <p> The cost-rental model is a practice used internationally where the State provides public housing on public land and in doing so deflates rental costs.  The Vienna model exemplifies this.  I welcome the budget which has mandated approved housing bodies, AHBs, to provide such units next year, albeit a modest 400 units.  This model is a generational investment to create a housing market that is equitable and sustainable.  <\/p> <p> Since becoming Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien has requested a report on the current co-living guidelines which he received recently.  The Government is effectively in the process of evaluating the current co-living guidelines with respect to their viability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000056#GGG00400","speaker":"1574","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603228200,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Sinn F&eacute;in for bringing forward this Bill.  It is important.  We have had a good debate.  It is useful and the Government fully recognises the sentiment and intent of the Bill, albeit that there are unintended consequences which is why the Government will not be supporting it.<\/p>  <p>  Before I sum up, I will refer to a number of points that have been raised.  We need a more robust means of resolving the valid issues that have been raised.  A broader debate at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage would help that.  The issues of liveable cities, density and sustainable development have been raised and they certainly are at the core of what we are trying to achieve with the Town Centre First principle as well.  I am fortunate, while living here, to be living in the Liberties, which I love and is a home from home for me.  This is a community where people say \"Hello\" and is a fantastic community in which to be living in Dublin.  That is the kind of community approach which we need to try to replicate.  <\/p>  <p>  The point was well made by Deputy Naughten on private student accommodation providers and by Deputy Connolly on the commitment to social housing.  There is a strong commitment to social housing and approved housing bodies in the programme for Government.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is very much committed to that.<\/p>  <p>  I will recap finally on the provisions of the Bill, which specifically proposes to amend section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to repeal the build-to-rent and shared accommodation sections of the apartments guidelines for planning authorities issued by the Minister under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act in 2018.  The point here is that quite fundamental changes are proposed in this small Bill of only three sections that would have a significant impact on the consistent and effective operation of our planning system. <\/p>  <p>  Section 28 as enacted empowers the Minister responsible for housing, local government and heritage to issue guidelines to planning authorities regarding any of their planning functions to which planning authorities must have regard.  The subsection the Bill proposes to delete, section 28(1C), enables guidelines issued by the Minister under section 28 to also include specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs, with which planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must comply.  We have heard the rationale and good reasons why this subsection was introduced in the first place.  These are as relevant and valid today as when they were when first enacted under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2015, which amended section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Under Section 28(1C), as part of the planning guidelines issued under section 28, a Minister may identify SPPRs, with which planning authorities or An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the exercise of their functions, must comply.  The SPPR amendment was inserted concurrent to a 2015 review and update of apartment planning guidelines to replace 2007 apartment guidelines.  The review process had been prompted by the adoption of development plans in a number of local authority areas that sought to either set higher minimum standards than those at national level, as set out in the 2007 guidelines document, or set additional, new standards in matters not addressed by the 2007 guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  As outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke earlier, these actions, although well-meaning, unilaterally departed from the national guidance which had been developed with expert input and were assessed to have the effect of unnecessarily and unjustifiably increasing the cost of new apartment development, either rendering such developments unviable or adding to costs ultimately borne by future occupants, whether purchasers or renters.  No one could reasonably advocate returning to such a situation as in 2015, where each of the four Dublin local authorities had different standards for apartment development, three of which departed from national guidance and where standards further varied across the country.  The 2015 apartment guidelines and the subsequent updated 2018 apartment guidelines used the SPPR mechanism under section 28(1C) of the Planning and Development Act to ensure clarity and consistency in providing national minimum standards in apartment developments.  <\/p>  <p>  As to whether it has been effective, the evidence would suggest it has.  In 2019, the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland independently assessed the impact of the 2018 apartment guidelines as contributing to a 10% to 20% reduction in build costs in Dublin, or &euro;28,000 to &euro;58,000 where applied in actual schemes.  While the viability of urban apartment development continues to be challenged, section 28(1C) has contributed to a significant increase in apartment construction in recent years.  The total number of apartments completed nationally in 2015 was 673 but by 2019, this had increased more than fourfold to 3,550.  While we must acknowledge that several factors contributed to this, ensuring a consistent set of national planning standards played a significant role.<\/p>  <p>  The ability to identify specific planning policy requirements under section 28(1C) enables an important distinction to be made between the general content of ministerial guidance, where there is scope for variation in application at local authority level, as opposed to the mandatory nature of specific aspects of guidance, where it may be necessary to identify requirements that must be applied consistently.  This Bill would remove a provision introduced to empower the Minister to ensure a nationally consistent approach to planning.  No one would want to revert to the position that existed in 2015, having four different apartment standards in each of the four Dublin local authorities.  To be fair, I do not believe the proposers of the Bill would want that either but it is nonetheless one of those unintended consequences that can and would arise if the Government did not oppose this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000057#HHH00200","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1603228200,"counter":529,"content":"<p>I remind the Minister that he is sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000057#HHH00300","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603228200,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I believe we have completed that.

The Bill seeks to override the Minister and Government by assuming on behalf of the Oireachtas, through primary legislation functions delegated to the Minister by statute under section 28, to issue, amend or revoke planning guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth repeating that it is not the purpose of primary planning legislation to ban or preclude any specific class or type of development.  It does not do so, with one notable exception.  Section 37K of the Planning and Development Act precludes planning legislation from enabling the authorisation of nuclear fission power generation in Ireland, which is illustrative of the national scale and significance of the potential development that merits specific prohibition.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, I again welcome the debate we have had.  As I stated at the outset, we recognise the intent and sentiment behind the Bill but as a Government, we also must recognise there are unintended consequences to it and it is in that regard that we are opposing this Bill.

The former Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, used his power in 2018 to impose mandatory planning guidelines on local authorities regarding apartment sizes and standards.  This opened up space for co-living developments.<\/p> <p>I use the word \"space\" lightly.  Why should a developer be allowed to build substandard accommodation and why are renters expected to accept a lower standard of accommodation?  Renters deserve the same standard of living as those who are purchasing properties.  As well as reducing apartments to the same size as disabled car parking spaces, co-living developments also limit the amount of sunlight one gets in one's home.  They are literally daylight robbery.<\/p> <p> Build-to-rent developments also allow for a lower ratio of car park spaces.  That would be fine in an ideal world where we have first-class transport systems but years of underinvestment and bad planning has left us with a transport deficit.  In my area of Dublin Mid-West there are several proposed build-to-rent developments, for example, in Lucan and Palmerstown.  These developments are about cramming as many apartments as possible into the space available with the minimum amount of car parking space.  BusConnects is a minimum of three years away and there is no guarantee that the existing public transport will get people to where they need to go.  How exactly are these tenants meant to get to work, to college or the shops?  I live in the real world and I can tell the Minister of State that lower car parking ratios are not in line with current local public transport.<\/p> <p> It is also time to ban co-living.  These are dressed-up 21st century bedsits.  They are a throwback to tenement style housing that rams people into 12 sq. m closets.  Co-living is bad policy.  Its aim is to make developers rich on the back of the desperation of tenants.  It is not a solution to the State's housing crisis.  If the Minister of State really wants solutions to the housing crisis they are right in front of him.  He needs to start listening to my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, who has been giving this House a masterclass on how to solve the housing crisis for several years.  The next thing he should do is support this Bill, ban co-living and build-to-rent developments, and put foundations in place to allow us build affordable homes to rent and buy.<\/p> <p> For the record, I want it to be known that there is not a Fine Gael or a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy present in the Chamber for this debate.  That shows their indifference to people's standard of living.  I am also not surprised that they have left the Green Party to carry the can tonight.

Nothing exposes the difference in Sinn F&eacute;in's vision and the approach adopted by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael than the stark statistic we heard tonight that there are currently planning applications for more than 5,000 co-living units, several multiples of the corresponding figures for affordable and social dwellings.<\/p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in the right to housing because we know that when that right is upheld our communities are better places for everyone to live in.  I personally know the benefits of good housing policy.  I know what it means for a poor family to be allocated a council house.  I know the difference that a home can make to a family trying to rebuild their lives.  A home gives a sense of security, a sense of place and a sense of peace that cannot and will never be provided in perilous temporary rented accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  My experience of housing provision was not unusual in my youth but today it would appear alien to many who are languishing on housing waiting lists.  There are families tonight in the same position that my family once found themselves in but instead of having the hope of securing a home, many of them are living daily with the fear that they will remain in hotel rooms or cramped rented accommodation for a long time to come.  Instead of the security, the sense of place or the peace that was once offered to those who needed a home, this Government offers short-term sticking plasters at huge cost delivered by speculators who are heavily subsidised by their friends in Government with Irish taxpayers' money.<\/p>  <p>  To add insult to the massive injury of its failed housing policy, Fine Gael's answer is co-living - bedrooms the size of car park spaces at a cost in excess of &euro;1,300 per month.

I would say, and I made the same point to Deputy Duffy, that at some point the review will end and the Government will have to make a decision.  That is the point at which all of us will have to make decisions around what we are willing to support.  On this issue, like so many others, that road is running short and all of us will be judged by what we do at the end of it.<\/p><p>I will respond briefly to the three central criticisms the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, made of our Bill.  The first is that he argued strongly in defence of section 28(1C) to provide national planning guidelines.  I have no problem with national planning guidelines but I firmly believe that if a Government is going to impose very profound changes on our planning system deliberately to prevent local authorities varying them, there should at least be a vote of the Oireachtas.  It is a very simple proposition.  The mandatory guidelines introduced in 2018 were a profound change and there was not a vote of this House or any other democratically elected body.  My argument is not against national standards <i>per se<\/i>; it is against the absence of democracy in making those standards.<\/p><p>However, and again with the greatest respect to the Green Party Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, we have a system of local government.  If the good people of Dublin city elect representatives who want to improve on the minimum standards of Government, should they not be empowered to do so?  One in four households in Dublin city rent and the reason Dublin city had better standards is because the councillors who were elected were reflecting the needs of their voters to provide better standards.<\/p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, where there was a very strong Green Party influence, exceeded the basic standards on energy efficiency and environmental protection.  That was one of the problems that industry wanted to design out of the system.  Should the good people of the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown administrative area not have the right to elect politicians to exceed the standards?  Government policy should be setting the minimum but if we believe in local democracy we should let our local elected representatives do what is in the best interests of their voters.<\/p><p>I thought the Minister of State made a very telling remark because he said that having higher standards, either more space in Dublin city or more environmentally responsible policies in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, would cost more.  The issue therefore was not really about standards; it was about viability as argued by developers.  There are many other ways of reducing some of those costs.  I refer to the 15% margin that the developers require, the 9% to 12% margin that financiers require and the ever-escalating cost of land in urban centres.  If we want to bring down costs let us focus on those and not compromise on living standards or environmental standards.<\/p><p>With respect to co-living, there is no argument to defend it.  Nobody has made an argument here today to defend it.  I do not believe a review is necessary.  It should simply be scrapped and we await with bated breath the Minister's review.<\/p><p>With respect to build-to-rent, again, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, did not address the issue.  Why do we have two sets of standards in the apartment design guidelines, one for people who buy their apartments and one for renters?  Is it that renters somehow do not need the same amount of daylight?  Is it that they do not need the same amount of storage?  Is it that they do not need the same quality and comfort?  If Government policy, through its compact growth strategy, wants more people to live and to rent in apartments for longer periods of time we have to build them to the best quality of standards.  Rather than the 2018 guidelines harmonising standards, they create two separate standards and the losers, in too many cases, are renters.<\/p><p>The really damaging aspect of co-living and build-to-rent has been highlighted by many Deputies.  It is fuelling land price speculation in our urban centres and that is having an impact on the land market and affordability for everyone.  If we are serious about generating genuinely affordable homes, not only should we do what many Deputies, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, said, which is to increase investment in the delivery of public housing on public land to meet social and affordable need, we should stop using Government policy to fuel land price speculation to deliver the wrong kinds of homes with all sorts of negative effects.  That is why I believe this Bill should be supported by the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000058#JJJ00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1603229400,"counter":538,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1603229400,"counter":539,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 22 October 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000059#KKK00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Gn\u00f3 na D\u00e1la - Business of D\u00e1il","time":1603229400,"counter":540,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000059#KKK00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1603229400,"counter":541,"content":"<p>The Chief Whip has a proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000059#KKK00400","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603229400,"counter":542,"content":"<p>It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 6<i>b<\/i>, motion re sittings and business, be taken now without debate and that any division claimed thereon be taken immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000059#KKK00500","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1603229400,"counter":543,"content":"<p>Is it agreed that the motion be taken without debate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000059#KKK00600","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1603229400,"counter":544,"content":"<p>It is not.

This question was brought to me by Paddy Malone of Dundalk Chamber of Commerce.  He is an accountant and he told me that every year there is an initial 31 October deadline for submitting returns.  He talked about self-employed small sole traders, namely taxi drivers and people who would be involved in trades, etc.  He said a significant number of them have been impacted massively by the pandemic.  Some of them have heard about the Revenue online system extension.  There is generally an extension for people who submit their returns online and pay on that date and it usually happens in or around November.  It was set for 12 November this year and that got extended to 10 December.<\/p>  <p>  It was explained to me that the difficulty in this regard is that the guy who owes &euro;100,000 and has no difficulty paying it, because he has the money, will leave it until the end.  That is fair enough because he has the money and he can pay it.  A significant number of people are under severe pressure, however, and many accountants are rushing to get returns in for them because if they get their returns in on 31 October, then they do not necessarily have to pay on that date.  The problem is that some of them believe they have an extension but do not actually have one.  That are worried that if they put in their returns on 10 December but cannot pay, they will miss out on their audit exemption, which might mean they have to pay more money from an accounting point of view.  Also, they do not have the money up front so this needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000062#PPP00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603230600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>This matter was specifically raised with me by my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and a number of people have contacted me about it since.

While many people are happy that an extension has been granted from 31 October or, say, mid-November to 10 December, there is a concern out there that there are small businesses that are not fully aware this is the case.  We have been contacted by accountants who are struggling to try to ensure they facilitate these businesses and make them aware of the issue.  We believe awareness of this matter needs to be raised.  We want to highlight it to the Government in the hope that something might be done or, at least, awareness might be raised.  There is a fear among many accountants that if they use the extension, they might not be able to meet those needs come 10 December.  This Topical Issue matter has been raised to make the Government aware of this problem and to alleviate the concerns of those accountants and smaller businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000062#PPP00400","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603230900,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mair&eacute;ad Farrell for raising this issue because it is one that is very current to many small business persons and even larger businesses.  The provision for tax warehousing, which is in itself a good measure, allows people time to pay on a cash flow basis at no interest in the first period.<\/p>  <p>  Since the outset of the pandemic, Revenue has been mindful of the pressures on businesses and has taken steps to enable them to cope with the restrictions.  Revenue has stressed that businesses that are having difficulty should continue to file their returns and that if they are encountering difficulty making payments they should contact the unit dealing with their tax affairs in order to put arrangements in place.  Since March, Revenue has allowed businesses to warehouse VAT liabilities from the January-February 2020 VAT period onwards and PAYE liabilities from the February 2020 income tax month onwards.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue has recently stated in its frequently asked questions document on debt warehousing that if a business was able to reopen when restrictions eased in the summer but has had to close again due to the reimposition of restrictions, the warehousing of tax debts, including VAT and PAYE liabilities incurred while the business was temporarily reopened, can continue until the new restrictions are lifted and the business reopens again.  Businesses that are eligible to warehouse debts can warehouse amounts up to two months after reopening, pay no interest on these debts for a further 12 months and pay a reduced rate of 3% per annum on these debts until they are paid off.  To qualify for tax warehousing, businesses must continue to file their returns in a timely manner.  This does not mean they must pay off the debts; it just means they must file the returns.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance announced in the Budget Statement that tax debt warehousing is now being extended to excess payments of the temporary wage subsidy and to this year's income tax payments.  Full details of these measures will be provided in the finance Bill which is expected to be published in the coming days.  I will repeat that.  Payments in respect of this year's income tax payments will be included in the warehousing provisions in the finance Bill to be brought before the House in the coming days.<\/p>  <p>  Another measure already taken has been to provide for a reduced rate of interest on pre-Covid liabilities.  Section 6 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Act provides that outstanding pre-Covid-19 tax liabilities would be subject to an interest rate of 3% per annum where the taxpayer applied to make a phased payment arrangement with Revenue.  This is a reduction from the normal interest rate of 8% or 10% per annum, depending on the tax in question.  The scheme applies automatically to existing phased payment arrangements.  The legislation which provided for this measure set a deadline of 30 September 2020 to apply for a phased payment arrangement.  Revenue has extended the date for finalising the phased payment arrangement to 31 October 2020.  This was announced on 1 October 2020 in a brief issued on the Revenue website.<\/p>  <p>  As mentioned, budget 2021 provided for the extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to cover the balance due on 2019 income tax liabilities and 2020 preliminary tax.  The warehousing of income tax will apply to any self-assessed taxpayer - that is, all the small businesses and the people the Deputies referred to - who expects his or her income for 2020 to be at least 25% lower than his or her income for 2019 as a result of the Covid restrictions.  In the case of taxpayers who were not chargeable persons last year, warehousing may apply to preliminary tax liabilities for 2020 where the taxpayer contacts Revenue advising it that he or she is unable to pay his or her liabilities as a result of Covid restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The date for filing tax returns for 2019 and paying preliminary tax for 2020, as provided for in the legislation, is 31 October 2020.  As the Deputies mentioned, Revenue has extended this date to 10 December.  This is four weeks later than the normal deadline of mid-November.  If the Deputies have any further comments, I will try to deal with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000063#QQQ00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1603230900,"counter":558,"content":"<p>I just want to make sure I have this correct.  People are worried about two things: that they will not have the money and that they will not make the 31 October deadline.  Obviously, there are logistical difficulties for accountants at the minute trying to get information to Revenue on temporary wage subsidy scheme returns, etc., which has created its own difficulties.  People are concerned that if they do not have the money for the 10 December scenario, they will suddenly be in difficulty and could lose tax certification or their audit protection.  Small companies are also worried about 31 October and the Companies Registration Office returns from the point of view that they might lose audit exemptions.  Again, the issue is the general cost of accounting that would lead to.  I am very interested to ascertain, on behalf of these small-scale self-employed people or sole traders, what the position will be if they make a return on 10 December.  Can they come to some sort of arrangement in respect of moneys if they do not have enough?  I would like absolute clarity on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000063#QQQ00300","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603230900,"counter":559,"content":"<p>My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, has outlined the questions.

I ask the Deputies to bear with me on this.  If a taxpayer has underpaid his or her 2019 preliminary tax liability, the balance of income tax for 2019 cannot be warehoused.  However, and this is an important \"however\", Revenue announced last Friday, 16 October, in its electronic brief No. 190\/20, that this liability can be included in a 3% reduced-interest phased payment arrangement if the taxpayer agrees this with Revenue no later than 10 December 2020.  It is important to note that for amounts that cannot be warehoused, people can contact Revenue.  Once they do so before 10 December, they can get in under the new 3% rate that applies to the phased payment arrangement, not technically under the warehousing system.  Revenue will agree to that 3% interest rate warehousing.  That is important.  The warehousing of unpaid tax - we are talking about VAT, PAYE, PRSI, USC, income tax and corporation tax - will not prevent the business from obtaining tax clearance.  That is the position as long as the business continues to meet its obligations for qualifying for warehousing of tax debts by filing all tax returns and paying other liabilities as they fall due.  The key point here is to get one's tax returns in.<\/p> <p>One can agree to make the payment next year, the following year or the year after.  Once a person gets his or her returns in on time the Revenue Commissioners know what they are talking about and will come to the arrangement of 0% for the first 12 months and then 3% after that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000063#QQQ00700","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":564,"content":"<p>That is even for 10 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00200","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":565,"content":"<p>Yes, once it is in for 10 December.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":566,"content":"<p>And they have the communications.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00400","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":567,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00500","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Aviation Industry","time":1603231500,"counter":568,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":569,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as an &aacute;bhar seo a roghn&uacute; le haghaidh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta anocht.<\/p><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for choosing this Topical Issue.  The Minister of State is familiar with, and I am aware she has met, the management and directors of Ireland West Airport Knock.  I know she is fully aware of the situation currently faced by the airport.  When one thinks that in 2019 some 807,000 people travelled through Knock airport, this year, at very best, there will be 170,000.  That will be a much harder figure to reach now given the decision by Ryanair last week to, effectively, shut down almost all of its winter services, bar seven.  Ryanair took that decision as a consequence of not being able to deal with the current travel restrictions.  That is a different row.  I want to focus on the airport.<\/p><p>Last week in the budget, which we welcomed, allocations were given specifically to Shannon and Cork airports because of the particular cash flow difficulties in protecting the cash balances at those regionally based airports.  However, we have not been able to get any detail as to how much money will be given from the regional airports programme to Ireland West Airport Knock and to Donegal and Kerry airports.<\/p><p>The regional airports programme is traditionally run successfully and its support for regional airports is welcome.  The Minister of State must accept, however, that this year it is not fit for purpose in a Covid-19 environment.  Our regional airports do not have any non-core income this year.  Their car parking and retail income is destroyed and, unfortunately, the employment they give to hundreds of families across County Mayo has been absolutely hammered this year.  Staff who were laid off completely when the airport was fully closed are now on short-time work.  While they have the support of the previous temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, now called the employee wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the rates remission scheme, it will not be enough to sustain the future of the airport.<\/p><p>We cannot wait for the 2021 regional airports programme.  There needs to be a special allocation for 2020 extraordinary losses that will sustain cash flow and allow the airport to prepare itself for 2021.  I do not know what the travel forecasts are for 2021.  The Minister of State might be more privy to that information.  They do not look very encouraging from this vantage point but we cannot turn our backs on Ireland West Airport Knock and we cannot stick our heads in the sand and hope it will survive.<\/p><p>In 1986, the week the airport opened, <i>The Western People<\/i>headline stated that it could not be done.  It was done because of people power.  It was done in spite of tremendous opposition at the time from the permanent government.  We must regain that spirit.  There was irony in the coverage by the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>at the weekend of the troubles of Cork Airport that summoned up the spirit of the late Monsignor Horan in defending Cork Airport.  That is what we need from the Minister of State.  We need that spirit.  We need that sense that it can and will be done in 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00700","speaker":"1602"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":570,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for providing me with the opportunity to speak about the impact of Covid-19 at Ireland West Airport Knock and, in particular, with regard to the decision of Ryanair to reduce its services.<\/p>  <p>  Like all airports, Ireland West Airport Knock has been fully exposed to the intense decline in global aviation activity and, unfortunately, the decline has been further compounded by Ryanair's announcement to cut its winter capacity at the airport.  As a key player in delivering high-quality international connectivity to the western region, I am fully aware of the significant impact of this latest news on the airport.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, the decision by Ryanair to cut flights was part of a wider move by the company to cut its capacity on flights right across Europe. This development, therefore, was not entirely unexpected given the low booking rates to the end of this year.  The challenges faced by the aviation industry are immense and totally unprecedented in living memory.  In that context, I fully appreciate the growing concerns regarding the long-term economic viability of many airports, particularly smaller aviation enterprises like Ireland West Airport Knock.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure Deputy Calleary, however, that the continued viability of these airports is important to this Government.  As the Deputy will be aware, policy on regional airports seeks to optimise conditions for regional development and connectivity both for social and economic benefits.  As employers, they contribute to the local economy and employment is also supported through the various ancillary services they provide.  This is why this Government took strong and immediate action to assist business and protect employment at the outset of this crisis.  A comprehensive suite of generalised supports for all companies has been put in place.  These include the wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, the waiver of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland West Airport Knock has received a range of supports through these measures.  That aside, I am aware that Ireland West Airport Knock is still experiencing an unprecedented strain on its financial resources and has made very difficult decisions to manage that in a responsible way.  Where lay-offs have arisen, people have been supported through the Government's pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Ryanair's announcement can only have made matters worse in that regard and I empathise with all the employees at the airport, both directly and indirectly, who are impacted by this announcement.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this situation is not unique to any one airport in Ireland or, indeed, internationally at present.  I wish to remind the Deputy, however, that Ireland West Airport Knock is one of the airports receiving Exchequer support as part of this Government's regional airports programme.  Historically, Ireland West Airport Knock has been well supported through this Government-backed programme.  Last year, for example, it received &euro;9.4 million in Exchequer funds.  The majority of that funding went towards its runway overlay project.  This year to date, Ireland West Airport Knock has received capital support of over &euro;1 million and it is also eligible to apply for operational supports under the programme.  My Department recently invited Ireland West Airport Knock, along with Donegal and Kerry airports, to apply for current funding of which a total of &euro;3.5 million is available this year.  This funding is typically paid to eligible airports in December of every year.  Last December, for example, Ireland West Airport Knock received over &euro;1.7 million in operational supports.<\/p>  <p>  In keeping with this Government's priorities for regional development I am currently finalising a new regional airports programme for 2021 to 2025.  This will give funding certainty to Ireland West Airport Knock over a five-year timeframe, helping the airport to remain viable as it transitions through the various phases of Covid-19.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have secured &euro;21.3 million in funding for the programme in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to advise the Deputy that all support mechanisms for the aviation sector will continue to be reviewed in the context of the Government's plans for international travel, having regard to the recommendations of the aviation task force and the forthcoming national economic plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00800","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1603231500,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.

In the context of &euro;10 million being paid to Shannon and Cork airports, I believe &euro;3 million for an airport that delivers over 800,000 passengers is a pretty small ask.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the multiannual funding and acknowledge that.  How much of the &euro;21.3 million for the programme for 2021 is broken down towards the public service obligation, PSO, route and how much is broken down for capital or expenditure?  How much of that &euro;21.3 million in 2021 will actually be given to operational expenses?  While I welcome the multiannual funding, unless we get decisions in the next few weeks, by the end of five years Ireland West Airport Knock will be in a different place from where it could be.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, this time last year we were moving with the runway allocation, the majority of which was paid for from within the airports own resources.  We are, however, also looking at the area around the airport.  We had the strategic development plan in place and developing it to its potential was always envisaged.  However, here we are 12 months later as a consequence of Covid-19, which I accept, and the airport is once again fighting for survival.<\/p> <p>All we are looking for is a level playing pitch, and similar to the announcement made last week of &euro;10 million to airports which previously got substantial funding in the form of debt write-offs, new major terminal buildings, etc., I ask that our airport, Ireland West Airport Knock, gets a level playing pitch in recognition of its size.  Maybe it is time to separate it from the regional airports and give it an acknowledgement of the role that it plays as a very major airport on the Atlantic economic corridor and on the west coast.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000064#RRR00900","speaker":"1602","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603232100,"counter":573,"content":"<p>I assure the Deputy that this Government is fully committed to our airports and especially to airports like Ireland West which facilitates tourism and economic development for the entire region.

The work that is needed is acknowledged not just by me in this House but by the public as well, so I acknowledge that at the outset.  I am also conscious of the fact that with language being used this evening in terms of contact tracing, there is a feeling of being overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task and by the magnitude and scale of the challenges as well.<\/p>  <p>  I put down this question on the back of difficulties expressed to me yesterday morning and over the previous weekend by some school principals.  The reason they contacted me was there were communication difficulties in dealing with cases that they were alerted to them on a Friday evening and then going through the process over the weekend.  The issue could be summed up in a nutshell by saying it concerns the communication, point of contact, direction and protocol for contact tracing.  Since putting down this question yesterday, I am delighted to see that there has been considerable progress made over the past day.  The primary level stakeholders and the secondary level stakeholders met with NPHET today as well, and that is really necessary to instil confidence in the leadership within the school communities, because we all know, appreciate and certainly know the value of children and teenagers being back in the school system.  Teachers have been very closely monitoring their progress since schools have come back.  Parents have noticed progression where regression happened when pupils were absent from school for up to about six months, and it is important we hold on to that progress.<\/p>  <p>  To summarise, what I am raising is something that has already been enacted by the people concerned.  I am very well aware of demands on the system and the contact tracing system, but it is really important and incumbent on all of us to ensure whatever resources and strengthening of the existing system that can be done should be done.  That focus, especially with the participation of NPHET officials at the stakeholders meeting, was a positive step forward today.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge the role played by officials within the Department of Education and Skills.  They have been liaising quite closely with Department of Health officials for a long time, going back to last March and there is constant communication and constant engagement in ensuring that they try to get things right.  I know from my own communication with them and from my own relationship with them in my previous role that the different officials work morning, noon and night to try to get this challenge under control.  We are all on the same hymn sheet, whether it is parents, teachers or principals, to ensure the progress that has been made in having children and teenagers back in school stays on track to ensure we continue with the primary motivation of educating our young people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000065#SSS00300","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1603232100,"counter":576,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for putting down the question and giving us an opportunity to clarify it on the floor of the House.  Communication is key on this.  It is key for the principals, the parents and most importantly for the continuity of children attending schools.  I am going to read out the script as it was prepared for me because the clarification points are very important.  Before I begin, however, it is important to say all officials in both Departments are working tirelessly together to ensure anything that needs to be done is being done to ensure education can continue.<\/p>  <p>  I am happy to have this opportunity to outline the protocols and supports in place for schools and briefly describe the overarching public health principles, including case investigation and risk assessment, that govern the response to cases and outbreaks of Covid-19, which are consistently applied across all school settings.  In all schools with a suspected case of Covid-19, HSE public health will undertake a risk assessment to assess the unique risks in each situation and decide on appropriate, proportionate action to protect the health of students, staff and the wider community.  It is important to note that these actions will vary in different schools.  This is because every school is unique, with unique risks related to the spread of Covid, so different measures are required to manage outbreaks in different schools.  This is entirely appropriate and is a core tenet of public health management of outbreaks of notifiable infectious diseases, including Covid-19.  The public health risk assessment, PHRA, approach is described in the Schools Pathway for Covid-19: the Public Health approach, available on the Back to School web page.<\/p>  <p>  Risk assessment is carried out under the jurisdiction of the public health doctor at the relevant regional HSE department of public health.  Public health doctors are expert in risk assessment.  As outlined, because every school setting is unique, the risk of Covid transmission will vary on a case-by-case basis.  The risk assessment process for each outbreak in a school setting assesses a variety of context-specific factors to determine appropriate and proportionate measures to be taken to protect the children and staff in the school and to prevent onward transmission and protect public health.  For example, if a confirmed case of Covid-19 with links to a school is identified, HSE public health will undertake case investigation to determine whether the person has been in the school during the infectious period.  If he or she has been in school during the infectious period, HSE public health will undertake contact tracing and risk assessment.  This may result in a whole pod or class being excluded and tested for Covid-19 if they are deemed to be close contacts.  When public health departments are formally informed of a person with Covid-19 who attended an educational facility whilst infectious, they then undertake a PHRA.  This usually happens the same day, or the following day.  There has been a delay in one particular region which the HSE is working to address urgently.<\/p>  <p>  The public health medical service is available seven days a week, and contact with schools is made on this basis.  The risk assessment is dynamic and is evolving as more information becomes available.  For example, if contact tracing identifies additional confirmed cases that are widespread throughout the school and HSE public health suspect transmission in the school setting, this may contribute to a decision to close a facility partially or fully as an outbreak control measure.  However, if, following case investigation or risk assessment, it is determined there is no risk of transmission in the school setting, HSE public health may advise that further testing in the school is not required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000065#SSS00400","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1603232700,"counter":577,"content":"<p>That was a comprehensive answer and it is good to see the response included upfront honesty on where challenges exist.  In one particular area, the Department and HSE are working to deal with ongoing issues.  It is important that we continue to be transparent.  Information is key.  Re-emphasising the seven-day week availability to principals will be very important in the days ahead.  The intense feeling among primary and secondary principals and teachers, as the Minister of State knows, is they want to continue teaching.  They see the progress and they want to be in a position to lead on the educational front and take a responsible position to lead on the health and safety front.  They have dual responsibility.  Following the meeting today and the comprehensive nature of the answer, I hope progress will be made.<\/p>  <p>  Many people have varied opinions on what happened last night.  As the evenings get shorter it will be a different lockdown at a different time from the lockdown in March when the sun was in the sky and the evenings were longer.  Now the evenings are getting shorter.  With regard to the 5 km rule, many people, and not just the elderly, go for walks in the evening.  People in rural Ireland could be living ten miles from lights or from a town or village.  We have to have due consideration for people who want to walk on a footpath in a safe area.  We do not want people endangering their lives or putting their safety in jeopardy.  We need to have closer scrutiny of this.<\/p>  <p>  There is much conversation about the GAA.  The GAA has always been here in the darkest of days when the country has been in the most difficult of times.  It was there for the school meals programme at a voluntary level when I was in my previous role.  Now that the evenings are short and people are in their houses, they have something to look forward to, whether it is intercounty football, hurling or camogie.  It is something on which we should work hard.  It is not a glamorous job for these GAA athletes.  They are not getting on buses.  They get changed at home and they go to training in their own cars and vehicles.  It is a difficult time for them but they are providing a ray of hope for so many people in the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000066#TTT00100","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1603232700,"counter":578,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

There is stress and pressure on the principals, teaching staff, parents and young people.  Most importantly, we need to be calm and measured in our approach, response and asks.  This is what the Deputy has articulated.<\/p>  <p>  I want to place on the record an important piece of information to do with contact tracing.  A process is in operation to support all ongoing school testing.  As of 13 October, 364 schools had, or were having, testing completed as a consequence of a public health risk assessment.  Of the 364 schools that have had mass tests, an additional 172 cases were detected and identified and 8,606 students and teachers have been involved in this mass testing.

Normally, I would deal with this issue locally but we have been frustrated in our attempts to get a satisfactory resolution from Irish Water.  What is the current status of the boil water notice relating to the Galtee regional public supply in County Tipperary?  The notice has been in place since 31 October 2019.  Approximately 120 properties are dependent on this supply to their homes.  Will the Minister of State give a full update on the steps that have been taken by Irish Water on this issue to allow the boil water notice to be lifted and ensure the residents of these properties have a safe, clean and reliable water supply in their homes as a matter of urgency?  In exactly 11 days, these households will have endured a full calendar year, 365 days, of being subjected to these conditions.  This is not acceptable by any standard.  It is appalling neglect and breach of contract.<\/p>  <p>  The boil water notice was lifted for 38 homes in the area.  It remains in place on a secondary section of the mains from Kilfeakle to Golden pending completion of remedial works and satisfactory monitoring results.  This continues to impact on 80 households.  The residents of these 80 homes are frustrated and, in fact, bitter over this long drawn-out saga.  It was possible to lift the restriction for the 38 homes following the completion of remedial works, primarily the installation of booster chlorination and water mains scouring, the receipt of satisfactory monitoring results, and after consultation with the HSE.  The 80 remaining homes have been left in limbo due to depleted chlorine levels in part of the network, and it is these 80 homes about which I am concerned and why I am raising this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The remaining homes have been thanked, no less, by Irish Water for their patience and told the issue will be rectified in that standard phrase \"as soon as possible\".  They have never been given any indication as to when this will happen.  No timeline has been put on it.  In the meantime, they continue to boil water for drinking, food preparation, bathing babies and children, brushing teeth and preparing infant bottles and food.  Prior to the pandemic these families struggled for more than three months.  One can only imagine how much more difficult the struggle has been since the pressures of Covid-19 were heaped upon them.  They are under intolerable pressure and inconvenience.<\/p>  <p>  During the remedial works that have been carried out to date, to restore a safe supply to the 38 homes, all households on the scheme were left with no water supply or significantly reduced water pressure.  In fact, there was a publicised case of a nurse who was unable to wash her uniforms as a result of the water pressure being too low to operate her washing machine.  This is an absolute scandal and is bordering on Third World conditions for these households.  I ask the Minister of State for a response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000066#TTT00300","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1603232700,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which is one of serious local concern, as he quite rightly pointed out.  Certainly it needs resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy appreciates that the operation of the Galtee regional water supply scheme is a matter for Irish Water, which, since 1 January 2014, has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  In turn, the Environmental Protection Agency, as environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for the provision of drinking water.  However, from inquiries the Department has made with Irish Water, I understand that a precautionary boil water notice for the area supplied by the Galtee regional water supply scheme was issued, as the Deputy said, in October 2019 following consultation between Irish Water, Tipperary County Council and the HSE.<\/p> <p>The notice was issued after scheduled network testing identified low chlorine levels in the area between Kilfeakle, Golden and Thomastown, caused by the age of the pipe network in this area.  Irish Water, in partnership with Tipperary County Council, undertook remedial works to improve the water quality, including the installation of automatic flush valves and a chlorine booster station in Thomastown.  These initial works allowed the boil water notice to be lifted from half the affected area at the start of this year.<\/p> <p> Further remedial works are now under way to resolve the remaining disinfection issues in the public supply.  The water quality will continue to be monitored over the coming weeks to determine whether these remedial measures have been successful.  Once the monitoring results verify the satisfactory residual chlorine levels and that the drinking water quality is in compliance with drinking water regulations, Irish Water will consult the HSE to determine whether the boil water notice can be lifted.<\/p> <p> The Department's priority is to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for personal hygiene and the washing of hands during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We all want to see this notice lifted without undue delay, but only when Irish Water has completed the necessary work and both the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have confirmed the water supply is safe once again.  Irish Water, along with the relevant authorities, is working to resolve this issue as soon as possible and has advised affected customers to continue to boil water before use to ensure the protection of their health.  Additional information and advice on boil water notices is available on Irish Water's website or by calling Irish Water's 24-hour customer care line.<\/p> <p> Both our water and our wastewater systems require substantial and sustained investment.

Following the decision to minimise on-site teaching, five of the seven universities have confirmed that students who do not wish to proceed with their booking in university-owned student accommodation can cancel it without charge, while those who opt to leave their accommodation will receive refunds.  I am awaiting confirmation of the policies of the remaining two, Trinity College and Dublin City University, DCU, but have made it very clear in meetings with the representative bodies of universities and institutes of technology, in the presence of student representatives, that the Government's position is that university-owned accommodation refunds should be provided.  I am aware that DCU has adopted a flexible model whereby students can book and pay for accommodation for a number of days and nights rather than a full semester, which seems to be an intelligent way to do it.

This is an area I have taken an interest in since taking up office.  The fee payable by a student varies depending on a variety of factors, including the type of course and the student's access route, including previous education.  The Department of Justice and Equality adjudicates on a person's entitlements to remain in the State and on the stamp that is awarded where permission to remain is sanctioned, the granting of certain permissions to reside in the State conveys certain rights, as provided for in legislation, including access to education in line with the rights of an Irish citizen.  However, some permissions do not convey such entitlements.  Determinations of these permissions are a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and outside the direct remit of my Department.<\/p>  <p>  The free frees initiative and the SUSI support system have been adapted in line with the enactment of legislation, with the most recent changes following the introduction of the International Protection Act 2015.  The rules of the respective schemes are cognisant of the importance of access to third level education.  My Department also operates an administrative-based student support scheme for asylum seekers which provides supports along similar lines to the SUSI grant scheme.  This scheme was introduced in 2015 and is available to persons who are asylum applicants, subsidiary protection applicants or leave to remain applicants.  Following a review of the 2019 scheme, I announced in August an amendment of the rules and the objective to have that scheme placed on a long-term footing.  These changes were welcomed by the Irish Refugee Council.  The requirement for prospective applicants to have attended three academic years in the Irish school system and to have obtained the leaving certificate in the State will no longer be required.  Prospective applicants, however, will still have to meet the requirement to have been in the protection or leave to remain process for three years.  It is an important step but we need to do more.<\/p>  <p>  To directly answer the Deputy's question as to whether legislative change would be required, I believe it would be based on what I have just set out.  I also note the work of the advisory group on the provision of support.  The Deputy will be aware that Cabinet considered that today and my understanding is it is likely to be launched tomorrow.  My Department will be guided by the commitment in the programme for Government to publish a White Paper on international protection issues by the end of this year so I expect will make further progress on this, guided by said White Paper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000068#VVV00600","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1603233900,"counter":600,"content":"<p>The issue is that there are young people in schools in this country who were born and have grown up in this country and who, because of a racist referendum in 2004 and the legislation introduced on foot of it the following year, do not have Irish citizenship.

This may have been an academic question until now but some of those young people are now 15, knocking on the door of 16, and very soon will be wanting to go to college.  The annual fee in University College Cork to do nursing is &euro;4,106 for someone who is an EU national and &euro;16,264 for someone who is not.

It is one of the reasons I very much welcome the fact that, on the advice of public health, we can keep access to college libraries and the likes open, albeit on a scheduled and organised basis, because there may be some students in this country who decide they would rather remain in accommodation they have organised near the campus and continue to access those sorts of facilities.  It has been, and is, a significant priority for me in the context of the shift to online teaching and learning that has arisen from public health restrictions to provide support to students to facilitate connectivity and examine options designed to seek to minimise the extent to which connectivity challenges can act as a barrier to full participation in higher and further education.<\/p>  <p>  On engagement with the Union of Students in Ireland, I made it clear that the student assistance fund can be used to meet connectivity costs.   Without getting into all the technological solutions, I agree with the Deputy that giving someone a laptop that they cannot access the Internet on is not enough.  As part of the package of financial supports, we provided funding to purchase ICT devices and, in addition to that, we have significantly increased the student assistance fund which can be used to meet connectivity costs.<\/p>  <p>  The big piece is obviously the delivery of the national broadband plan but in the interim, there are initiatives across a number of Departments to facilitate connection through community-based broadband hubs and liaison with telecommunication providers on packages, including unlimited data.  <\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that, at present, HEAnet provides a WiFi solution, Eduroam, designed by and for the higher education community which operates across education locations nationally.  Eduroam allows a student to access WiFi wherever Eduroam is broadcast, enabling a student to seamlessly roam from one Eduroam location to another.  HEAnet is currently working on options to extend the reach of Eduroam beyond the traditional campus locations to areas such as public transport, libraries, caf&eacute;s and other public spaces.  An extended Eduroam footprint would greatly overcome connectivity challenges and facilitate staff and students in effective teaching and learning activities.  HEAnet has already made progress in this regard, with Eduroam now available at many teaching hospitals and several public libraries.<\/p>  <p>  I recently chaired a meeting between HEAnet and relevant Departments and public sector bodies to explore the potential for further pilot projects that could be done quickly in the coming weeks and months.

Could unused on-campus accommodation be offered at a subsidised rate to students who have no Internet connectivity at home?  That accommodation should also be looked at for students whose home lives are not conducive to them participating fully in third level education.  We need to find innovative ways around all of this to make sure that things are accessible.<\/p>  <p>  I am also concerned that students are being charged for the use of digital hubs that have been publicly funded.  One student I spoke to last week is being charged &euro;50 a month for that service.  Surely it cannot be right that we publicly fund those hubs and then seek to charge students at the same time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020102000069#WWW00700","speaker":"1501"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234500,"counter":610,"content":"<p>I will check that issue and revert to the Deputy on it.<\/p>  <p>  Among the potential sites for the proposed pilots to which I referred a moment ago are broadband connection points, public libraries, museums, municipal buildings, public transport, airports, some of which are already being availed of in that regard, and public areas.

That way, wherever our students or staff are, they can log on and access material as through they were on campus.<\/p>  <p>  HEAnet is also going to explore with private commercial enterprises the possibility of making Eduroam available in time through public WiFi connections, especially in recreation areas to which students might gravitate, including caf&eacute;s or other spaces where they might like to meet up.

There are two issues.  I took the words \"student assistance fund\" from the question.  In regard to the student assistance fund of &euro;16 million, which is available in all colleges across the Republic of Ireland, I can confirm that students from Northern Ireland are eligible to apply for support under that scheme.  The Deputy is familiar with the scheme so I will not take the time to go through it.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the &euro;50 million once-off financial support scheme, it is my intention, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to announce the design of that scheme in the coming days.  I will share my thoughts on it with the Deputy.  It is likely that there will be a once-off top up payment to people in receipt of the SUSI grant, which could include people from Northern Ireland.  There is also the possibility of having a once-off return or a rebate of some of the registration fees.  <\/p>  <p>  The figure of &euro;250 has been out there.  People have arrived at that by taking a figure of 200,000 full-time students in higher education in Ireland and dividing it by &euro;50 million which equals &euro;250 per student.  The long and the short of it is that if a student is in receipt of the SUSI grant or paid a student contribution fee, which students in the North would have, then he or she will be as entitled to access the scheme as are students in the Republic.

That is one case we all know about because Dr. N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in spoke about it publicly, and we thank her very much for doing that.
