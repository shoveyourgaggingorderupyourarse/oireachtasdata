Schools will also be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is making over 1,000 additional teaching posts available to post primary schools in the free scheme. Posts equivalent to 0.6 PTR reduction will be allocated based as normal on school enrolments and will be clearly identifiable in the school&rsquo;s staffing schedule.

The total cost of such an adjustment across the public sector is of the order of &euro;200 million, of which Education accounts for &euro;83 million. The report also acknowledges that, during the financial crisis, there were policy changes which affected remuneration in different occupations across the public sector (including education).<\/p>  <p>  The matter of new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector alone. The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.<\/p>  <p>  On 24 September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.<\/p>  <p>  This agreement is benefitting 16,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is fully aware that the teacher unions have outstanding issues of concern following the September 2018 agreement. These outstanding matters will be given full consideration. This will happen either in the context of any pay review mechanism agreed by the parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement, or in the context of the next round of pay talks. The positions of each of the parties on these matters must be given due regard in endeavouring to reach a mutually agreed resolution.<\/p>  <p>  The current series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions and shows the benefits that such engagement can bring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000102#WRB01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":69,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000102#WRB01100"},{"type":"question","counter":70,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[19295\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000102#WRB01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 388 of 21 July 2020, if the decision will be reversed not to grant an exemption for three pupils to allow them to repeat their final year of education in a special needs school (details supplied) in Dublin 22.","asker":"1468","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":71,"content":"<p>As outlined\u00a0previously, special schools funded by my Department are classified as primary national schools and are intended, in accordance with the provisions of Rule 64(1) of the Rules for National Schools, to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.<\/p><p>Special schools may however seek approval from my Department for an exemption from Rule 64(1) in respect of students over the age of 18 who are pursuing courses leading to accreditation on the National Qualifications Framework (e.g. Junior Certificate\/LCA\/FETAC 3). <\/p><p>A request for an exemption from Rule 64(1) can only be made by a school where:<\/p><p>1.

It should also be noted that an additional investment in the region of &euro;34m annually is also provided to support the ongoing secondment and substitution costs associated with CPD provision. <\/p>  <p>  This investment in professional learning represents approximately\u00a01.8% as a proportion of my Department centralised teacher payroll spend in 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Specifically in the area of leadership a key focus for the Department in recent years has been to build the professional practice of teachers with a focus on collaboration and supporting school leaders. My Departments support services have dedicated teams within both JCT and PDST providing support to lead teaching and learning in schools. My Department also funds the Centre for School Leadership (CSL) established in 2015 which presents a unique opportunity for the development of a coherent continuum of professional development for school leaders. It is the shared objective that the Centre will become a centre of excellence for school leadership. Through CSL, leaders through the continuum of their leadership journey are supported through a post graduate for aspiring leaders, mentoring for newly appointed leaders, coaching for established leaders and cluster support for school leadership teams. My Department also supports the provision of professional learning through both IPPN and NAPD. The total investment in leadership, including personnel and substitution is in the region of &euro;5m annually.<\/p>  <p>  As set out in the recent Programme for Government, there is a commitment to continue to develop innovative measures to support school leadership and the quality of teaching, informed by data and a focus on student learning and potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000103#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000103#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[18799\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000103#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the training and further education supports that will be put in place as part of the July stimulus to help jobseekers to upskill and reskill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>The Covid-19\u00a0pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on younger workers and those in lower paid occupations with lower level of educational qualifications.

Any other recommendations the CLRG consider appropriate.<\/p><p>I expect the CLRG&rsquo;s report by early October.<\/p><p>In addition to this, as part of the CLRG&rsquo;s Work Programme for 2020 - 2022 I will ask that they examine as a priority, the following specific commitments from the Programme for Government:<\/p><p>- review whether the current legal provisions surrounding collective redundancies and the liquidation of companies protect the rights of workers effectively; <\/p><p>- review the Companies Act 2014 with a view to addressing the practice of trading entities splitting their operations between trading and property with the result being the trading business, including the jobs, go into insolvency and the assets are taken out of the original business; and<\/p><p>- examine the legal provision that pertains to any sale to a connected party following the insolvency of a company including who can object and the allowable grounds of an objection.<\/p><p>I recognise that there have been earlier reviews of these issues, including in the CLRG&rsquo;s 2017 Report on the Protection of Employees and Unsecured Creditors and in the Duffy-Cahill report of 2016. I will be asking the CLRG to undertake an expedited review, taking account of this previous work, and considering recommendations in the light of the economic challenges we now face.<\/p><p>I will be asking the Group, which operates on a voluntary basis, to make recommendations by the end of the year. When this work concludes, the Government will be ready to act and propose legislation, where this can achieve improvements.<\/p><p>I intend to send the final Work Programme to the Chairperson of the CLRG very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000104#WRD07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":297,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000104#WRD07400"},{"type":"question","counter":298,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[20259\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000104#WRD07500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the number of applications for the restart scheme by county; the number of applications granted and refused in each county; and the allocation to each county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":299,"content":"<p>I have set out in the table below the total number of applications received and which have been paid\u00a0and the number of applications approved and awaiting payment per Local Authority under the Restart Grant scheme as of 24 July 2020.\u00a0 The table also displays the total number of applications which have been rejected and the number of applications received but not approved.<\/p><p>A funding tranche of &euro;200m was made immediately to the 31 local authorities, collectively, to meet the initial applications made to the scheme.

The Statement sets out clearly that the\u00a0existing demand\u00a0for\u00a0data centre development poses opportunities and challenges for Ireland and that a planned approach to addressing these is required. <\/p>  <p>  Since the publication of the Government Statement in 2018, IDA Ireland has increased its emphasis on promoting a range of regional options for data centre investment. They have\u00a0identified specific sites in regions throughout Ireland that are potentially suitable for accommodating the sustainable development of large scale data centre projects in terms of proximity to necessary energy and other appropriate infrastructures, subject to the required planning and environmental oversight. IDA Ireland only facilitate investment in projects that are deemed likely to deliver real regional economic benefits\u00a0 and do not provide any financial supports for data centres in the Dublin region. Officials in my Department engage regularly\u00a0with IDA Ireland in relation to enterprise policy, and related matters, including on this topic. <\/p>  <p>  Data centres present challenges given that they are very energy intensive and, in the Dublin region in particular, there are\u00a0electricity grid infrastructure\u00a0capacity constraints. While this is not research conducted within my Department,\u00a0Eirgrid has undertaken extensive analysis with regard to future electricity grid requirements including the impacts of data centre development through for example the 'Tomorrow's Energy Scenarios' process. Eirgrid has previously\u00a0made it\u00a0clear that there may in future be a need to limit the connection of large new electricity demands in certain geographic areas.\u00a0Investments in the electricity transmission and distribution systems are planned and\u00a0implemented\u00a0by Eirgrid and ESB Networks in line with national energy policy and under the supervision of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. Under the 2019 Climate Action Plan and the Government Statement, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are leading a working group to encourage investment by large energy users, such as data centres, in renewable electricity generation using Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPA); officials in my Department and IDA Ireland have been engaging with this work.<\/p>  <p>  Data centres are important to ensuring that Ireland continues to be a leader in the digital economy. Ireland has one of Europe&rsquo;s largest clusters of data centres as a stable energy grid, temperate climate and significant skills base makes Ireland an attractive country for this form of investment.

The CCPC, ComReg, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Irish Courts are National Competition Authorities (NCAs) in Ireland for the purposes of EU competition law.<\/p>  <p>  The Department chairs an Interdepartmental Committee comprising of representatives from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, the Courts Service, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, ComReg and the CCPC to contribute to the drafting of the General Scheme of a Bill. A comprehensive request for legal advice is awaited from the AGO to facilitate finalisation of the General Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Once the Department receives the AGO&rsquo;s legal advice the full scope of the implementing legislation will be decided by the Cabinet prior to the publication of the General Scheme. In bringing forward this legislation we seeking to implement the Programme for Government commitment to enable the CCPC to make greater use of administrative penalties to sanction rogue operators.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has been liaising closely with the CCPC in order to identify and ensure that the necessary resources will in place to effectively implement the new provisions in the forthcoming legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Competition and Consumer Protection Commission","counter":313,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[20378\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on the performance of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission in view of its failure to uncover price fixing or bid rigging activity here in 2019; and his views on the capability of the commission to properly enforce national and EU competition rules with respect to cartels and bid rigging going forward.","asker":"1610","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":315,"content":"<p>Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is independent in the performance of its functions. As enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, have no direct function in these matters. <\/p><p>However, the CCPC has advised me that in 2019, the CCPC referred a file to the DPP in relation to an investigation into bid-rigging in the procurement of publicly-funded transport services in the south west region (including Limerick, Clare, South Galway, Kerry, North Tipperary and Cashel). The bid-rigging file sent to the DPP was the culmination of an in-depth investigation, involving a wide number of parties and multiple lines of enquiry. As is the case for the majority of cartel investigations in Ireland and across the world, this investigation took place over several years. The CCPC&rsquo;s 2019 Annual Report (attached) provides further details of the CCPC&rsquo;s investigation.<\/p><p>The detection, investigation and prosecution of cartels is one of the highest priorities for the CCPC. However, a cartel is the most serious breach of competition law. It is a criminal offence, which has a very high evidential standard of &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo;. This has obvious implications for the standard of evidence required to both open an investigation and for the CCPC to make the decision to prepare a file for the DPP.\u00a0 This is not unique to the enforcement of competition law in Ireland as the difficulties of proving anti-competitive behaviour to a criminal standard of proof are well recognised. By way of illustration, the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK has had five criminal convictions since 2008, the CCPC has had 35 since 2006, including 2 convictions in 2017 for bid-rigging in the commercial flooring sector. At present, competition law in Ireland only allows for a company to be fined if a court finds that there has been a criminal breach of competition law. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government commits to enabling regulatory bodies such as the CCPC to have greater use of administrative penalties to sanction rogue operators. Primary legislation is under preparation in my Department will incorporate the transposition of Directive EU 2019\/1 (ECN+) and come into effect in 2021. This will result in the introduction of a number of significant changes to the current competition law enforcement regime in Ireland, in particular the requirement to introduce non-criminal financial sanctions for breaches of EU competition law or breaches of both EU and Irish competition law. The purpose of the Directive is to ensure that national competition authorities have the appropriate public enforcement tools in order to bring about a common competition enforcement area. This legislation will increase the tools at the disposal of the CCPC to take enforcement action against breaches of competition law. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Employment Rights","counter":316,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":317,"qnumday":118,"qnumall":"[20394\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000105#WRE01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the legislation he will bring forward in the next D&aacute;il term to protect and strengthen workers&rsquo; rights ","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":318,"content":"<p>Employment rights and the legislation relating to these rights are currently under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.\u00a0 These will shortly move to my Department as part of a wider transfer of functions.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland already has a comprehensive body of employment legislation, in respect of which the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) is mandated to secure compliance and we have a strong track record when it comes to protecting the rights of workers.\u00a0 Ireland&rsquo;s employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on a contract of service basis.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Mr Damien English T.D.\u00a0Minister of State with responsibility for Employment Affairs and Retail Businesses, will be examining this area as a priority.

The potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to maximise their commercial revenue particularly in the context of the current media climate. Importantly, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with EU law.  <\/p>  <p>  An example of airplay quotas in the EU can be seen in France. In 1994, France introduced a mandatory quota for 40% airplay of French language music on French radio stations, this quota was reduced to 35% in 2016. Any quota for airplay would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music meeting certain criteria in a more advantaged position. However, a quota for airplay of music in a particular language, as is the case in France, can be justified under EU case law, as the preservation and promotion of an official language of a Member State constitutes a general interest objective. Unlike music in a particular language, a quota system for music produced in a particular place, as suggested in this question, does not appear to have grounds for exemption from the general requirements of EU law. Therefore, without a similar justification on the grounds of promoting cultural diversity, a quota for music produced in a particular Member State would be considered to restrict free movement of services by placing music produced in other Member States at a disadvantage.<\/p>  <p>  The government is not currently considering airplay quotas based on production location.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee","counter":384,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF01100"},{"type":"question","counter":385,"qnumday":141,"qnumall":"[19697\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF01200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of fines that have been issued in respect of the non-payment of television licences from 2015 to 2019 and to date in 2020; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":386,"content":"<p>An Post acts as issuing agent for TV Licence fee collection in accordance with Section 145 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and all operational matters are dealt with by An Post.  <\/p><p>An Post makes every effort to bring evaders into the licensed pool and a considerable amount of time and resources are spent on dealing with this issue.

The number of electric vehicles is expected to continue to increase as more models become available and the supporting infrastructure continues to be put in place.<\/p><p>In October 2017, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities published an independent regulatory decision that, inter alia, set out the need for the future provision of EV charging infrastructure to operate on a commercial basis.<\/p><p>This provision of free fuel for electric vehicles is not sustainable on a commercial basis. The Low Emission Vehicle Taskforce, an inter-Departmental group established in December 2016 to consider the range of measures and options available to Government to accelerate the take-up of low carbon technologies in the road transport sector, noted that the introduction of fees would further incentivise charging at home and provide an income stream to support the operating costs associated with public EV charging infrastructure.<\/p><p>However, it is recognised that capital grants will be required to reduce the capital cost of installing new infrastructure. That is why the Government is investing, in a sustained way, in EV charging infrastructure across the country.

By the end of next year, NBI plans to pass in the region of 115,000 premises, with 70,000 - 100,000 passed each year thereafter until rollout is completed. All counties will see premises passed in the first 2 years and over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high speed broadband within the next four years. The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date.<\/p><p>Design work is complete or ongoing in target townlands across 17 counties and steady progress is being made with circa 55,000 premises surveyed to date.

I understand that NBI has started survey work in Mullingar. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found using an eircode search on the NBI website . Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website .<\/p><p>To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main deployment under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website . The BCP delivery project is well underway and connectivity is being provided to each of the sites by National Broadband Ireland (NBI). Subsequent to this, the sites, other than schools, are being Wi-Fi enabled by Vodafone under a contract with the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work also involves the local authorities and site owners determining the services that will be provided for end-users at each site. For the 75 schools that are also part of this project, enabling these schools with Wi-Fi is being led by the Department of Education subsequent to NBI providing the connectivity to the schools.<\/p><p>Bringing connectivity to remote rural locations is central to promoting regional development and BCPs represent an important delivery in the early stages of the National Broadband Plan. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Just Transition Commissioner","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF04700"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[19986\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF04800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the details of progress in respect of the Just Transition Commissioner's progress reports' aim to develop community engagement through community workshops, which had been scheduled for April 2020 but was delayed due to the national and international restrictions due to Covid-19.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":422,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[20971\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF04900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the community and worker engagement process as set out for the midlands region, Bord na M&oacute;na workers and communities; the way in which the process is operating in view of Covid-19; his plans to advance community and worker engagement in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na and the just transition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":423,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[20972\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF05000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on whether the community engagement aspect of just transition has been applied successfully in other jurisdictions; his plans to instigate some of the measures in the just transition plan for the midlands; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1565","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":177,"qnumall":"[20976\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the community and worker engagement process as set out for the midlands region, Bord na M&oacute;na workers and communities; the way in which the process is operating in view of Covid-19; his plans to advance community and worker engagement in respect of Bord na M&oacute;na and the just transition; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[20977\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF05200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on whether the community engagement aspect of a just transition has been applied successfully in other jurisdictions; his plans to instigate some of the measures in the just transition plan for the midlands region; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1486","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":426,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153, 172, 173, 177 and 178 together.<\/p>  <p>  As stated in the Commissioner's report, the community workshops scheduled for April 2020 to be hosted by START as part of the Midlands process were delayed because of the national and international restrictions related to Covid-19.

At present, responsibility for the proposed Bill is being transferred to the Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht. <\/p><p>When this transfer of functions is complete, Government approval will be sought for the finalisation of General Scheme of the proposed Bill through the addition to the provisions relating to the funding of the Media Commission and the regulation of audiovisual media services. These additional provisions will then be forwarded to the Office of the Attorney General for addition as a basis for detailed drafting and to the relevant Joint Oireachtas Committee for pre-legislative scrutiny. It is for the relevant newly formed Committee to determine whether and when to commence such scrutiny.<\/p><p>At this time, the finalised General Scheme will also be notified to the European Commission for a technical conformity assessment with relevant EU law regarding regulations on online services.<\/p><p>The proposed Bill will establish a multi-person Media Commission, including an Online Safety Commissioner, dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, establish regulatory frameworks for online safety and the regulation of audiovisual media services, and transpose the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive.<\/p><p>The regulatory framework for online safety will be overseen by the Online Safety Commissioner. The Commissioner will have the power to designate online services for regulation and to create and enforce binding online safety codes. These will seek to minimise the availability of harmful online content through oversight of the systems that online services used to deliver and moderate content. The regulator will have the power to sanction non-compliant online services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000106#WRF07900","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":453,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000107#WRG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[20540\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000107#WRG00300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the role that the forestry industry contributes to climate change alleviation here; if he will encourage an expansion of this contribution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1514","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>Our forests provide eco-system services, support the environment and biodiversity as well as contributing to climate change alleviation and supporting Ireland to meet our environmental responsibilities.

The Government is committed to delivering high speed broadband to every home, farm, business and school in Ireland and my Department continues to engage with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of this rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Further information on deployment activities associated with the rollout can be found on the NBI website <i><\/i>. <\/p><p>To support remote working and connected communities, approximately 300 Broadband Connections Points (BCPs) were identified by Local Authorities to be connected to high speed broadband this year. This will assist communities to quickly get free public access to high speed broadband in advance of the main deployment under the National Broadband Plan (NBP). The planned BCP locations, including schools, library hubs, local sports facilities and other public places are available to view on the High Speed Broadband Map on the Department&rsquo;s website . The BCP delivery project is well underway and connectivity is being provided to each of the sites by National Broadband Ireland (NBI). Subsequent to this, the sites, other than schools, are being Wi-Fi enabled by Vodafone under a contract with the Department of Rural and Community Development. This work also involves the local authorities and site owners determining the services that will be provided for end-users at each site. For the 75 schools that are also part of this project, enabling these schools with Wi-Fi is being led by the Department of Education subsequent to NBI providing the connectivity to the schools.<\/p><p>Bringing connectivity to remote rural locations is central to promoting regional development and BCPs represent an important delivery in the early stages of the National Broadband Plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000107#WRG02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"North-South Interconnector","counter":477,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000107#WRG02600"},{"type":"question","counter":478,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[20907\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000107#WRG02700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if consideration will be given to the issues outlined in correspondence by Monaghan County Council (details supplied) regarding the proposed north-south interconnector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":479,"content":"<p>The North South Interconnector is critical to improving the efficient operation of the Single Electricity Market and increasing security of electricity supply across the island of Ireland.

This recommendation was accepted by the association and the rulebook, memorandum and articles of association were amended accordingly.<\/p>  <p>  Between November 2019 and January of this year, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Shane Ross and the then Minister of State with Special Responsibility for Tourism and Sport Brendan Griffin, T.D. met on a number of occasions with delegations from the Board of the association concerned who were seeking emergency financial assistance to stave off the looming threat of insolvency. In January, the then Ministers informed the Board that any additional funding would be conditional on the association committing to further governance reforms, which would extend beyond the recommendations of the 2019 governance review, including a commitment to appoint additional independent directors. The Ministers made it clear that such conditionality was essential given that auditors instructed by Sport Ireland had found that the association was not fit to receive public funds. The Ministers advised that, as the State was being asked to provide a multi-annual funding commitment outside of the normal grant scheme for funding sporting bodies, a Government decision was required to authorise the Minister to make available the level of financial support required to safeguard the future of the association and its 203 employees. In seeking the agreement of Government to enter a funding agreement with the association concerned, the then Minister Shane Ross confirmed to his Cabinet colleagues that the association would be required to accept and fulfil a range of additional governance and financial control reforms in order to access Government funding. On that basis, the Minister was granted authority by the Government and duly signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chairperson of the association on 30 January.<\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department will provide the Deputy with a full schedule of the then Ministers&rsquo; meetings with the Board of the association as well as copies of all correspondence between the Ministers and the association during the period in question.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to confirm to the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to the MOU signed by my predecessor and, as my colleagues Minister Martin and Minister Calleary have confirmed in writing, we have no intention of renegotiating the terms of the MOU. I recognise that the governance changes required in the MOU go further than the requirements of the Sport Ireland Governance Code or the recommendations of the association&rsquo;s 2019 governance review. However, these conditions are essential to restore public confidence in the association, to safeguard the very considerable public funds which are to be disbursed and to ensure there is no return to the dysfunctional leadership which led the association to the brink of insolvency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[19645\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he, his Ministers of State or his advisers have ever used private email for any form of official Government use since the formation of the Government; and if so, if he will publish all such emails and corresponding documents immediately.","asker":"1610","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>Neither Minister Hildegarde Naughton or her adviser\u00a0have used private email for any form of official Government use.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[19662\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000109#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the meetings he and his Ministers of State have had since the formation of the Government, by date, in tabular form (details supplied).","asker":"1610","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>A copy of my diary since my appointment as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and\u00a0Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment is outlined below.

In view of the nature of the present crisis and the central role of the National Transport Authority as statutory regulator, my Department's engagement with the SPSV industry has focused primarily on the statutory-based Advisory Committee on Small Public Service Vehicles (commonly known as the Taxi Advisory Committee). The National Transport Authority has communicated regularly with individual SPSV operators in relation to the impact of COVID-19 on the SPSV industry. This approach to engagement with industry will continue for the coming months as the Department and the NTA focus on assisting those who have stopped working return to work as the economy reopens and passenger demand for SPSVs returns.<\/p>  <p>  As you will be aware the role of that Committee under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 is to advise the Minister in relation to issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. The views of the taxi industry are well represented on that Committee through multiple Committee members with representative functions and backgrounds and experience in the sector.  The legislation stipulates that membership of the Committee includes at least four persons \"representing small public service vehicle and driver interests\".

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA). <\/p>  <p>  Last week, I announced a temporary enhancement to the HTB for the remainder of 2020 as part of the July Stimulus Package.  It will provide for an increase to the maximum HTB relief available to &euro;30,000 (up from &euro;20,000), subject to certain conditions.  The decision to include this measure was mindful of the findings of two previous studies on the scheme carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.  The later of the two studies (2018) found that the main driver of house prices was the mismatch between supply and demand rather than the existence of the scheme and that that following the introduction of the incentive there was a marked increase in supply which could be attributed in part to HTB.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation to give effect to this increase is set out in the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No.2) Bill 2020, which was published on 24 July 2020 and must pass through the various stages in the Oireachtas before it can be enacted.<\/p>  <p>  In summary, the changes to the scheme provide that where applicants enter into a contract for the purchase of a new house or apartment, or make the first draw down of the mortgage in the case of a self-build property, during the period from 23 July 2020 to 31 December 2020, they will be eligible for increased relief under the HTB scheme to the lesser of: <\/p>  <p>  - &euro;30,000 (increased from &euro;20,000), <\/p>  <p>  - 10 per cent (increased from  5 per cent) of either the purchase price of the new home or, in the case of self builds, the completion value of the property, or, <\/p>  <p>  - the amount of Income Tax and DIRT paid in the four years prior to making the application.<\/p>  <p>  Revenue are currently updating their systems to give effect to the enhanced HTB relief. <\/p>  <p>  Where applicants have made an HTB application with Revenue but believe they may satisfy the requirements of the enhanced HTB relief, then, when the Revenue system is updated to cater for the new enhanced relief, the applicants may cancel their original HTB application and reapply to avail of the increased relief.  Revenue will be issuing further guidance on the enhanced HTB in due course. <\/p>  <p>  If a taxpayer is uncertain about whether he\/she, or whether the particular contract that he\/she has entered into, satisfies the conditions to avail of the enhanced HTB relief, the taxpayer should contact Revenue via the My Account online service giving full details of the specific circumstances including, where relevant, a copy of the contract in question. Each such case will be considered on a case by case basis by reference to its circumstances and the conditions that must be satisfied to avail of the relief. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to tax paid in the previous four years, as with Revenue refunds generally payments made under the Help-to-Buy incentive are refunds of tax paid (including DIRT) to the Irish Exchequer over the previous four years immediately prior to the application, this four year look back is standard for all Revenue transactions. In order to qualify for the Help-to -Buy incentive, an individual or couple must have paid tax in Ireland for at least one of the previous four years. There is no requirement that this be the most recent of these years. The incentive is scheduled to operate until the end of 2021, meaning tax paid in Ireland this year could also be eligible for subsequent refund under the scheme at a later date. <\/p>  <p>  It is important focus on the delivery of additional housing supply. With regard to actual housing completions this year, I am conscious that there is likely to be a significant shortfall in 2020 as compared to the targets which were envisaged in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. This temporary enhancement to the Help to Buy is intended to stimulate construction activity and help to get us back on track for the rest of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The date of the announcement of the changes (23 July) was chosen as it ensures a consistent approach on the issue of cut-off dates within the scheme since its inception on 1 January 2017 (and backdated to the date of the original announcement on 19 July 2016).<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the possibility of back-dating the measure; backdating the changes to a date before 23 July would not have any incentive effect for purchasers, self-builders or developers and consist of deadweight. Individuals who purchased new homes did so without the expectation of the additional relief.  Similarly, those who commenced the drawdown of mortgages in respect of self-built properties before 23 July would also not have expected the subsequently introduced additional tax relief to be available to them. Unfortunately, as with all time bound reliefs, there will always be those who just miss out on qualification. However, for the reason already mentioned, I do not propose to change the start date for the temporary enhancement to the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carbon Tax Yield","counter":815,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM02000"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[19613\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the annual revenue raised from the carbon tax in each year from its introduction up to 2019, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":817,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[19614\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM02200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated annual revenue that will be raised from the carbon tax in each year from 2020 to 2025; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":818,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 294 and 295 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the annual receipts raised from Carbon Tax in each year from 2010 to 2019 are published on the Revenue website at the following link:<\/p><p>. <\/p><p>Revenue has also advised me that forecasts for Carbon Tax receipts in each year from 2020 to 2025 are shown in the following table. <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>&euro;m<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2022<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2023<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2024<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2025<\/td>       <td>560<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The forecast for 2020 is based on the expected receipts having regard to the fall in consumption due to COVID-19 restrictions and my Department&rsquo;s macro-economic projections from the April 2020 Stability Programme Update.

The Central Bank has made it clear to all\u00a0regulated firms that they must take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that\u00a0it continues to monitor this situation\u00a0very closely to ensure that lenders are complying with this requirement.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Indeed,\u00a0the three main retail\u00a0banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings on the 15th and 16th of July that they are considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis. The BPFI has published a Covid-19 support information document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.<\/p><p>However, within the parameters of the regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgages, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial\u00a0decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.\u00a0 Also it may be\u00a0the case that a loan offer from a lender may contain a condition that would allow the lender to\u00a0withdraw or vary the offer if, in the lender&rsquo;s opinion, there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender. <\/p><p>Furthermore if a mortgage applicant has paid a deposit for a property but is then refused the mortgage drawdown to complete the transaction, this is covered under the sale or conveyancing of property and is a matter that is generally governed by property and contract law and as Minister for Finance I do not have a primary policy function for the law relating to the conveyancing of property or in relation to the operation of private contracts.<\/p><p>However, as the conveyance of property is usually a significant transaction it is likely that both the purchaser and seller of a property will employ legal expertise to advise, assist and protect the interests of their clients on the various legal, financial and other associated requirements at each stage of the property transaction.\u00a0<\/p><p>Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to\u00a0make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.\u00a0 The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.\u00a0 The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.\u00a0 In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.\u00a0 Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower and in this regard\u00a0I welcome the recent statement from the pillar banks\u00a0that they will assess\u00a0mortgage applications from people in receipt of the temporary wage subsidy scheme on a case by case basis.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>However, if a consumer if not satisfied with the way a regulated entity is dealing with\u00a0his\/her mortgage application or drawdown then, under the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, s\/he can make a\u00a0complaint to the lender.\u00a0\u00a0If the consumer is still\u00a0unhappy with the position following the outcome of the internal complaints process, then s\/he\u00a0can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).\u00a0 Clear information on how to make a complaint to the FSPO may be found at this link:.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":822,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 297 and 298 answered with Question No. 293.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":823,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM03000"},{"type":"question","counter":824,"qnumday":299,"qnumall":"[20030\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000112#WRM03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the help to buy scheme will be extended to second houses in view of the chronic shortage of new housing developments available to first-time buyers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":825,"content":"<p>Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act of 1997 provides for The Help to Buy\u00a0scheme (HTB).\u00a0 HTB\u00a0was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of the &lsquo;Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness&rsquo; and\u00a0was due to terminate on 31 December 2019.

In addition, the Government has no direct influence over award levels, as awards are a matter for the Judiciary.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will appreciate, there is no single policy or legislative fix to remedy the cost and availability of insurance issue.\u00a0 Reforms have been made and we have seen some improvement in some aspects of the insurance market but what is now needed is for the ongoing reform measures to be implemented and to quickly bear fruit.\u00a0 In this regard, the Programme for Government identifies a range of issues that the Government will prioritise so as to benefit consumers, including small businesses, as well as in the various community groupings and facilities throughout the country. This cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which I believe builds and expands upon previous work done by the Cost of Insurance Working Group, is a priority for this Government and in particular for my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In terms of addressing insurance premiums for small businesses, particularly those in the leisure sector, a necessary step is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions. The establishment of the Judicial Council last December is very important in this regard, and it is expected that the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee will submit draft Guidelines to the Judicial Council by 28 October. The guidelines could play a role in the lowering of award levels and also could lead to a more consistent application of making awards in courts. Insurance Ireland has commented that if award levels come down so will premiums charged by its members. I believe that this is a very important commitment and\u00a0this Government intends holding the insurance industry to their previous statements in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In conclusion, I wish to emphasise that insurance reform is a priority for the Government and as noted above this is reflected in the Programme for Government.\u00a0 This is an issue I, as Minister for Finance, along with my Departmental colleague, Minister of State Fleming, will focus on.\u00a0 In doing so we will be cooperating with our Ministerial colleagues that will be participating in the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment in terms of prioritising the commitments on insurance reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000113#WRN03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":890,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000113#WRN04000"},{"type":"question","counter":891,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[20407\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000113#WRN04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of individual earners who do not qualify for the stay and spend initiative on the grounds that they have neither income tax nor USC liabilities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":892,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[20408\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000113#WRN04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of individual earners who have neither USC nor income tax liabilities (details supplied).Details; in similar format to that given in Tables 3 and 4 of Income Tax Strategy Group &ndash; 19\/03 Paper, published July 2019","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":893,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.<\/p><p>The tables referred to by the Deputy in question 328, which is regularly used in Tax Strategy Group paper on Income Tax (most recently in 2019), is based on data that is presently set out on page 3 of the Revenue Ready Reckoner at the following link: <\/p><p> .\u00a0 <\/p><p>Attention is drawn to the caveat at the beginning of this document that makes clear that the costings shown are based on revised tax forecasts, that they are tentative costings and likely to be revised as further information becomes available particularly in the current economic climate.<\/p><p>This source table is re-produced here as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Ready Reckoner<\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th>No. of Tax payer Units**<\/th>       <th>% of<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Income   Tax*<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>440,400<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>Standard Rate (20%)<\/td>       <td>1,120,700<\/td>       <td>45<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>Exempt<\/td>       <td>911,100<\/td>       <td>37<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>USC*<\/td>       <td>8% rate<\/td>       <td>185,200<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>4.5% rate<\/td>       <td>1,083,100<\/td>       <td>44<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>2% rate<\/td>       <td>488,300<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>Exempt<\/td>       <td>715,600<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Paying   Neither Income Tax or USC<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>715,600<\/td>       <td>29<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total   Income Earners<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2,472,200<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Shows the breakdown by the highest rate of Income Tax and USC paid by taxpayer unit.<\/p><p>** Married persons or civil partners who have elected or who have been deemed to have elected for joint assessment are counted as one tax unit.<\/p><p>The figures in this table are subject to rounding to the nearest hundred.<\/p><p>In respect of question 349, based on the above data it is estimated that 715,600 taxpayer units will not have an income tax or USC liability in 2020 so it is possible that they may not be able to benefit from the Stay and Spend Incentive.

The Central Bank has made it clear to all regulated firms that they must take a consumer-focused approach and to act in their customer's best interests at all times, including during the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it continues to monitor this situation very closely to ensure that lenders are complying with this requirement.<\/p><p>Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Indeed, the three main retail banks assured the T&aacute;naiste, Leo Varadkar T.D., Minister McGrath and me at meetings on the 15th and 16th of July that they are considering applications and mortgage drawdowns from customers on the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme on a case by case basis. they also assured us that they are taking a fair and balanced approach.<\/p><p>The BPFI has published a Covid-19 support information document which customers can consult, or customers can contact their lender directly, if they have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application.<\/p><p>However, as the Deputy is aware, subject to the parameters of the regulatory framework governing the provision of mortgages, the decision to grant or refuse an individual application for mortgage credit is a commercial decision to be made by the regulated entity and it is not appropriate or possible for me to instruct lenders in that regard.  Also it may be the case that a loan offer from a lender may contain a condition that would allow the lender to withdraw or vary the offer if, in the lender&rsquo;s opinion, there is any material change in circumstances prior to drawdown. In such cases, the decision to withdraw or vary the offer is also a commercial and contractual decision for the lender.<\/p><p>Regarding the regulations governing mortgage credit, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016, which transposed the Mortgage Credit Directive into Irish law, require lenders to make a thorough assessment of the consumer&rsquo;s creditworthiness.  The assessment must take appropriate account of factors relevant to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement and must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer&rsquo;s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which is necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  The Regulations further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer&rsquo;s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes &lsquo;Knowing the Consumer and Suitability&rsquo; requirements on lenders.  Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower.  The measures outlined above, which are designed to protect borrowers from being exposed to unsustainable mortgages, were introduced in response to the experiences arising during, and since, the last downturn. <\/p><p>However, if a consumer if not satisfied with the way a regulated entity is dealing with his\/her mortgage application or drawdown then, under the provisions of the Central Bank Consumer Protection Code, s\/he can make a complaint to the lender.  If the consumer is still unhappy with the position following the outcome of the internal complaints process, then s\/he can make a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO).

These include income supports, new or repurposed debt funding arrangements, temporary waivers of commercial rates and &ldquo;warehousing&rdquo; of tax debts. This Bill contains a series of immediate measures to support businesses and increase consumer confidence, thereby stimulating the economy to return to capacity as businesses and society resume activity in accordance with public health advice and Government decisions. The Bill was designed to use the available budget to benefit as many sectors as possible, as quickly as possible, and as simply as possible. <\/p>  <p>  It is in this context that section 11 of the Bill introduces a new measure to accelerate corporation tax loss relief, to provide cash flow support of up to &euro;450 million for previously profitable companies that are now experiencing losses as a result of public health measures. It does this by allowing companies to estimate their losses for an accounting period containing all or part of the period March to December 2020. Companies may then make an early claim to carry back 50% of those estimated losses for offset against taxable profits of the prior accounting period, which will generate an immediate refund of some or all of the corporation tax paid for that accounting period. <\/p>  <p>  Under normal rules, this carry back would not take place until up to nine months after the end of the loss-making accounting period, when tax returns and accounts are filed. The new provision allows claims to be made (and revised if necessary) at any time from four months into the loss-making accounting period and up to five months after the end of that accounting period. This significantly accelerates the tax repayments to companies that can be generated from the offset of these losses against previously taxed profits.

Other income earners in receipt of comparable &ldquo;normal wages&rdquo; are taxable on those wages.  In the interest of equity, payments under the TWSS and the PUP are subject to income tax. Payments under the TWSS are also subject to universal social charge (USC), while the PUP follows the general taxation rule for social welfare payments and, thus, is exempt from that charge.  Payments under both schemes are exempt from PRSI charges.<\/p>  <p>  Neither PUP nor TWSS payments are taxed in real-time through the PAYE system, but a recipient of either payment may become liable for income tax and USC (for TWSS only) at the end of the year, which will be calculated by Revenue through the end of year review process.  <\/p>  <p>  In cases where the tax liability for those payments exceeds unused personal and PAYE tax credits for 2020, the level of tax and USC due by the person may be reduced or eliminated by the amount of unused tax credits available to him or her at the end of the year. Any liability due may also be further reduced if the person has additional tax credits, for example health expenses, to offset. Revenue has also very recently placed all recipients of TWSS payments or the PUP on what is known as the &ldquo;week 1 basis&rdquo; of taxation for the remainder of the year so as to &ldquo;preserve&rdquo; unused tax credits that can then be used to offset any income tax or USC liabilities that may arise at end year. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that the final calculation of the end of year tax liability for each person is dependent on a range of factors, including the person&rsquo;s civil status, their available tax credits, the amount received under TWSS and\/or PUP, any top-up payments made by the employer, as well as other entitlements and credits, such as health expenses.  Revenue has also assured me that if any tax and USC liabilities still arise at end year following the allocation of unused credits, it will work with its customers to collect the outstanding liabilities over an extended period.  This will be achieved by reducing their tax credits for future years, thereby minimising any financial hardship to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":940,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[20489\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of employers that have returned payments made by the Revenue Commissioners under the temporary wage subsidy scheme since its inception; the amount in cash terms that has been returned to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":941,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) has provided financial support to over 65,000 employers in respect of almost 627,000 employees.

Of necessity, the legislation and the scheme itself were developed very quickly to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees that have been seriously affected by the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  The amount of subsidy payable to eligible employees is based on their &lsquo;average revenue net weekly pay&rsquo; (ARNWP) for January and February 2020, as returned by the employer to Revenue through the real-time PAYE system. The ARNWP calculation is based on the number of insurable weeks within the January\/February period.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 April 2020 I announced a number of changes to the TWSS to ensure further support for workers on lower incomes and to allow employers to pay a higher level of top-up. These changes mean that more employees now receive a subsidy of &euro;350 per week. <\/p>  <p>  Section 2 of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) (No. 2) Bill 2020 makes provision for the introduction of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) which will ultimately replace the TWSS. Both schemes will run in parallel from 31 July 2020 until the TWSS ceases at the end of August 2020. Employers who have already availed of the TWSS may make an additional claim for non-TWSS employees in the EWSS from 31 July.  This is to provide additional flexibility in circumstances where employees were not previously eligible to be paid via TWSS, such as new hires and seasonal workers.  If applicable, some claims may be backdated for employees who have been paid from 1 July 2020.    <\/p>  <p>  As with the TWSS, the purpose of the EWSS is to maintain the link between the employee and employer insofar as is possible.  It is therefore based on the number of employees on the payroll and the employer is expected to make best efforts to maintain as close to 100% of normal income as possible for the duration of the subsidy period. <\/p>  <p>  Looking forward, the EWSS is an economy-wide scheme that will focus primarily on business eligibility, delivering a per-head subsidy on a flat rate basis.  This adaptation from the TWSS will allow employers to rely on the continuation of support over a longer period of 8 months while also ensuring such support is sustainable and affordable.<\/p>  <p>  The primary qualifying criteria is that the employer must be able to demonstrate that they are operating at no more than 70% turnover from July to December 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The level of subsidy the employer will receive is per paid employee:<\/p>  <p>  - For every employee paid more than &euro;203 gross per week, the level of subsidy is &euro;203<\/p>  <p>  - For every employee paid between &euro;151.50 and &euro;202.99 gross per week, the subsidy is &euro;151.50<\/p>  <p>  - A nil subsidy is payable for employees paid less than &euro;151.50 or more than &euro;1,462 gross per week.  <\/p>  <p>  A 0.5% rate of employers PRSI will continue to apply for employments that are eligible for the subsidy.  This represents a considerable saving for the employer in addition to the flat rate values above (up to 11.05% of the full wage paid).<\/p>  <p>  The position in relation to the EWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay. As the economy continues to reopen, the capacity of businesses should also increase so that they can increasingly rely on their own resources to cover extra hours worked.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme","counter":950,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":951,"qnumday":354,"qnumall":"[20544\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for the help-to-buy scheme for quarters 1 and 2 in 2020; the number of applications approved in the same period; the estimated annual number of recipients of the scheme in 2020 and 2021; the estimated median payment under the scheme; and the estimated expenditure per year.","asker":"1551","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":952,"qnumday":356,"qnumall":"[20631\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000114#WRO04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of recipients of the help-to-buy scheme in 2020; the median payment under the scheme; and the expenditure to date.","asker":"1489","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":953,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 354 and 356 together.<\/p><p>I am advised by Revenue that some 6,847 applications have been received for the Help to buy scheme (HTB) to date this year, for the period 1 January to 30 June 2020.

In that regard, an individual&rsquo;s tax residence status is determined by reference to his or her presence in the State during a particular tax year.  For example, an individual will be considered tax resident in the State if he or she is present in the State for:<\/p><p>- 183 days or more in a tax year; or<\/p><p>- 280 days or more in a tax year and the preceding tax year when taken together, with a minimum of 30 days in each year. <\/p><p>An individual&rsquo;s liability to Irish income tax is determined by reference to the source of his or her income and his or her Irish tax residence, ordinary residence and domicile status for a particular year.  <\/p><p>Prior to COVID-19, Revenue guidance stated that where an individual is prevented from leaving the State on his or her intended day of departure due to extraordinary natural occurrences or an exceptional third party failure or action &ndash; none of which could reasonably have been foreseen and avoided &ndash; the individual will not be regarded as being present in the State for tax residence purposes for the day after the intended day of departure, provided the individual is unavoidably present in the State on that day due only to &lsquo;force majeure&rsquo; circumstances.  <\/p><p>Revenue&rsquo;s interpretation of &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; has been updated to consider those cases who, as a result of COVID-19, have had a departure from the State restricted directly as a result of the emergency situation.  In any case where a taxpayer relies upon &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo;, it will be necessary for him or her to be able to appropriately support this position (i.e. information\/documentation in relation to how a departure from the State has been prevented due to restrictions in place).  This is likely to occur when an individual reviews their tax position for 2020 with a view to filing their 2020 return of income which is due by 31 October 2021.  <\/p><p>It is not possible to determine the number of individuals who have benefitted from the updated Revenue guidance. Indeed, it is not possible to determine whether the additional time spent in the State will have materially affected an individual&rsquo;s Irish tax residence position in any event.  For example, a relatively short period of additional days spent in the State is unlikely to result in a non-resident individual being considered tax resident for a particular year.  A non-resident individual may, however, continue to have a liability to Irish income tax to the extent they have Irish source income.

I have considerable sympathy for such policyholders.\u00a0 However neither I, nor the Central Bank can direct or require that insurers cover claims, including those resulting from infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, it is not a matter for the Government or Central Bank of Ireland to adjudicate on the validity of such claims.<\/p>  <p>  Whether a business can make a claim in relation to loss of earnings because of closure due to COVID-19 will depend on the specifics of their policy. I have made it very clear as a general rule that insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage.\u00a0 I believe that insurers should engage with those businesses honestly, fairly and professionally to honour those elements of the policies covered, in line with the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code.\u00a0\u00a0I retierated these points when I and Minister of State Fleming met with Insurance Ireland earlier this week.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I understand, however, that many businesses do not routinely have infectious diseases covered as part of their standard policies.\u00a0 In the case where infectious diseases are covered, there may be other considerations which will influence the decision of an insurer to not pay a claim. It is important therefore for businesses to engage directly with their insurer or broker on this matter, and where they believe an insurer has incorrectly rejected their claim, they should either consider referring the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman (FSPO) for adjudication or where their claim is in excess of the FSPO &euro;3 million limit they may wish to consider legal action. I understand that this is already happening in a number of cases.<\/p>  <p>  The above said however, my officials and I have been engaging with the sector in an effort to get some much-needed certainty for business policyholders. On business interruption claims, I wrote to Insurance Ireland on 27 March and indicated amongst other things that:<\/p>  <p>  (i) insurers should not attempt to reject claims on the basis of interpreting policies to their own advantage; and,<\/p>  <p>  (ii) that where a claim can be made because a business has closed as a result of a Government direction due to contagious or infectious disease, that the recent Government advice to close a business in the context of COVID-19 should be treated as a direction.<\/p>  <p>  Insurance Ireland, on behalf of its membership, responded on 3 April and stated that it accepted both of my points. It did however indicate that each insurance policy is different and there may well be other factors which lead to the adjudication of whether a business interruption claim is valid or not, other than Government advice to close.\u00a0 Following on from this correspondence, I held a teleconference with Insurance Ireland, on 17 April, where I reiterated that some insurers, by adopting a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; rejection of all business interruption claims, were doing the industry significant reputational damage and were not treating customers fairly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also note that the Central Bank of Ireland\u00a0wrote to the CEOs of major insurers outlining its expectations of them in this crisis from a consumer protection perspective. This included the Bank&rsquo;s belief that while most insurance policies are clear, if there is a doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail. The Central Bank of Ireland\u00a0is continuing to engage with the non-life insurance industry on these matters and will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that firms are meeting the expectations as previously set out.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should be assured that Minister of State Fleming and I will continue to be appraised on developments and will engage appropriately with the Central Bank of Ireland on the matter. This issue is recognised in the Programme for Government&rsquo;s extensive cross-Departmental insurance reform agenda, which amongst other things seeks to address consumer and business concerns on the cost and availability of insurance by building on the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as noted earlier Minister of State Fleming and I\u00a0met\u00a0Insurance Ireland yesterday\u00a0to talk about the Programme for Government insurance reform agenda matters and the need for an appropriate response from insurers including on the issue of business interruption.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000115#WRP00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illicit Trade","counter":978,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000115#WRP01000"},{"type":"question","counter":979,"qnumday":366,"qnumall":"[20873\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000115#WRP01100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his plans to implement additional measures to counteract cross-Border smuggling and illegal trade in products such as fuel, tobacco and alcohol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":980,"content":"<p>The serious threat that illicit trade in tobacco, alcohol and fuel products poses to legitimate business, to consumers and the Exchequer is clear and I am assured that combating such criminality continues to be a Revenue priority. \u00a0Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na collaborate closely in acting against cross-Border fuel, alcohol and tobacco crime, and also cooperate with their counterparts in Northern Ireland under the framework of the North-South Joint Agency Task Force.

Louth to just south of Arklow, Co. Wickow and the river catchments draining to it, and included the Boyne Catchment (Area 07), the Nanny-Delvin Catchment (Area 08), the Liffey Catchment (Area 09) and a number of small catchments in South Dublin and Wicklow (Area 20).  These four Plans were among a total of 29 such Plans published nationally by the Government in May 2018 as the key output on the culmination of the national CFRAM Programme. To support the implementation of the 29 Plans and, specifically, the 118 new flood relief schemes they recommended, the Government has committed almost &euro;1 billion in funding for flood risk management in the National Development Plan 2018 - 2027. As it is not possible to undertake all the recommended schemes at the one time, some 60 schemes have been prioritised nationally for implementation in the first tranche.  Of the 17 new schemes proposed in the Eastern FRMPs, 7 have been included for implementation in the first tranche.

The OPW has put in place a process for undertaking such reviews as recommended in the FRMPs nationally, and it is envisaged that these reviews will be complete within the next 12 months.  These areas include Aughrim, Kilcoole, Newcastle, Celbridge, Rush, Navan and Ratoath.<\/p><p>In addition to the structural measures (i.e. flood relief schemes ), the Plans also contain important non-structural measures to address flood risk and the overall implementation of the Plans is being overseen by an Interdepartmental Flood Policy Co-ordination Group.<\/p><p>A key role of the Interdepartmental Group is to carefully consider the extent of non-structural solutions that can inform the ten-year implementation strategy of the Flood Risk Management Plans. The 2009 Planning System and Flood Risk Management guidelines are informing planning decisions to prevent new properties being built in areas at risk from flooding. In 2016, the Government agreed to the establishment of a National Flood Forecasting and Warning Service to enable members of the public and local authorities take more preventative action to reduce the impact of flooding. An Implementation Plan for this service is being delivered by Met Eireann and is overseen by a Steering Group chaired by the Office of Public Works. It is a vital resource to inform future response to flood risk including how local authorities plan for and respond to flood events.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Procurement Contracts","counter":1030,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS03200"},{"type":"question","counter":1031,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[20322\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of social clauses included in public procurement contracts since 2013, by year, in tabular form.","asker":"1579","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":1032,"content":"<p>The inclusion of strategic, green and social policy considerations in procurement processes is a key feature of the Programme for Government.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, developed Circular 20\/2019: Promoting the use of Environmental and Social Considerations in Public Procurement. <\/p>  <p>  The Circular highlights the potential for Departments to support wider social and environmental aims through public procurement.

Taking into account the additional expenditure agreed by the D&aacute;il in relation to Covid-19 measures, the revised Government Expenditure Ceiling now stands at &euro;79.7 billion. This includes an additional &euro;6.8 billion for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, nearly &euro;2 billion for the Department of Health and &euro;483 million for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p><p>Further to this, a number of additional measures have been announced by Government in response to the Covid-19 crisis. At the end of June, additional Covid-19 related expenditure was estimated at approximately &euro;12 billion. This included the decision to extend the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme beyond the original end date of the schemes to August. Taking this into account, as well as the substantial package of measures included in the July Stimulus Plan and also taking into account further spending that may be required as the year progresses to support key sectors, including Education for the reopening of schools and for further and higher education, it is now estimated that the additional expenditure relating to Covid-19 in 2020 will be approximately &euro;16.2 billion.<\/p><p>At this time, a number of reconfigurations of Government Departments are in progress. When work in relation to all transfers of functions and related allocations is complete, restated Estimates will be presented to the D&aacute;il reflecting the new Departmental structures and their associated expenditure allocations. These restated Estimates will reflect decisions in relation to additional funding to respond to Covid-19, including for those measures set out in the July stimulus. <\/p><p>Managing expenditure within allocations is, as always, a key responsibility of every Department and Minister. As outlined above, in the last number of months, significant additional expenditure has been allocated to a number of Departments to support our citizens and our health service at this time of crisis.  While we find ourselves in an unprecedented situation with regard to Covid-19, all of the usual measures remain in place in relation to the sanctioning and management of expenditure with regular reporting on spending by Departments. This applies to all voted expenditure, including that set out in the July stimulus plan.<\/p><p>Looking at the Department of Health, a key Department in the response to Covid-19, a number of processes have been put in place or adapted in order to facilitate timely and appropriate allocation of additional resources in a streamlined manner. In the context of the prevalence of time-sensitive requests for procurement expenditure on items such as PPE, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agreed a streamlined sanction process with the Department of Health, in which expenditure items falling under the Covid-19 National Action Plan would be dealt with as a matter of urgency within the usual sanctioning processes.<\/p><p>Health Budget Oversight Group meetings are an oversight forum attended by senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Health and the HSE. In normal times these serve as an early warning mechanism to alert the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform of potential spend overruns and related issues. Previously held on a monthly basis, in the context of Covid-19 the Group now meets remotely on a weekly basis and its meetings consider COVID-19 related expenditure in detail.<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive reports to the Department of Health on Covid-19 related expenditure, with this expenditure then subsequently being reviewed by the Health Budget Oversight Group, which is chaired by an official in my Department.<\/p><p>In relation to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has been allocated substantial additional resources in response to Covid-19, new specific subheads were created for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) and the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). This means that there is transparency around where this funding has been allocated and how it is being spent. Regular reporting is in place with detailed analysis of payment data published on a regular basis by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the PUP and the TWSS, respectively. The most recent update for the PUP can be found here: . The most recent update for the TWSS can be found here: <\/p><p>Turning to performance indicators, the need for Departments to provide an immediate response to the Covid-19 crisis will have impacted on outputs in certain areas as resources were directed to respond to Covid-19. The Public Service Performance Report for 2019 was published this month. Work on the next iteration of this report will involve consideration of how to outline the impact of Covid-19 in terms of performance. The Revised Estimates Volume for 2021, due to be published in December, will also require consideration of how to deal with the impact of Covid-19 on Departmental performance and on performance indicators. <\/p><p>The aim of the Performance Budgeting initiative is to facilitate meaningful dialogue and engagement around how public funds are allocated and used. There are other elements of the whole-of-year budget process which aim to do this, including the National Economic Dialogue (NED). The role of the NED is to foster discussion on how to optimise available resources in the interests of all citizens, taking into account the many competing economic and social priorities within the limited available resources. This becomes ever more important in these unprecedented times. While this year&rsquo;s NED has been postponed in light of the COVID-19 outbreak and the necessary containment measures introduced to address it, providing stakeholders with a forum to discuss and promote debate on key issues, reflecting on national and sectoral developments remains an important element of the budgetary process. As outlined in the Programme for Government, the Government recognises the importance of regular and open engagement with all sectors of society and that this is particularly important as we steer our way out of the pandemic, rebuild our economy and support communities that have been severely impacted by COVID-19. In particular the Programme for Government outlines that Government will:<\/p><p>- Establish a unit in the Department of Taoiseach to coordinate social dialogue.<\/p><p>- Utilise public consultations, citizens&rsquo; assemblies and strengthen current mechanisms such as the National Economic Dialogue and the Labour Employer Economic Forum (LEEF).<\/p><p>- Ensure in all our engagements that the role of the Oireachtas and Government in policy formation is fully respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff","counter":1050,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1051,"qnumday":391,"qnumall":"[20624\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000116#WRS05500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if he will provide a schedule of advisers, special advisers and seconded civil servants currently working in his Department, appointed and-or recruited and-or in an acting capacity; the roles and responsibilities attributed to each; and the salary scale for the role, in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":1052,"content":"<p>On the commencement of every D&aacute;il, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issues guidelines setting out the arrangements for the staffing of Ministerial Offices.

Ireland signed up to the Agreement in 2003.   The agreement includes a commitment that &ldquo;Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as possible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables.\"  This is because there is slow accumulation of lead from shot in wetlands where hunting occurs.  The lead is generally harmful in the environment and can also be consumed by wildfowl.<\/p>  <p>  Since the Agreement was signed, the European Commission has published a draft Regulation for consideration by Member States on the use of lead shot in and around wetlands following a report on the matter by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).  It is my understanding that the proposal, should it ultimately progress into law, would make provision for a lead-in time to facilitate the making of arrangements to source alternatives to lead shot. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is aware that any change to the regulations around the use of lead in gunshot could provide a range of difficulties to transition to new guns\/gunshot for many gun owners in Ireland, including farmers and hunters, as many gun owners could have to make alternative arrangements, in many cases to purchase new guns. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the other relevant Government Departments, are fully committed to ensuring that this matter is addressed in consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including farmer and hunters, and that all potential impacts are fully considered.

All proposals will be comprehensively evaluated, including an extended lead-in time.<\/p>  <p>  My Department supports the underlying thrust of the Regulations and is committed to phasing out lead shot in and around wetlands,  However, it clear that Ireland will have transitional challenges with regard to the suggested short lead-in time.   My Department has submitted a document which has been circulated to the REACH Committee of the European Union, the forum where the Regulation is under discussion, suggesting an extended lead-in time to enable hunters and farmers and other stakeholders in the country to make the necessary arrangements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Issues","counter":1104,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1105,"qnumday":410,"qnumall":"[20856\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT03700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of unauthorised developments inspected by Waterways Ireland in each of the years 2018, 2019 and to date in 2020, by county in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1471"},{"type":"question","counter":1106,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[20857\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT03800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the number of inspections by Waterways Ireland of unauthorised developments carried out along the River Shannon and Lough Ree in each of the years 2018, 2019 and to date in 2020.","asker":"1495","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":1107,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 411 together.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland have provided the following information: <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Leitrim<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>These relate to developments on Waterways Ireland property.<\/p><p>Waterways Ireland have informed me that no inspections of unauthorised developments have been carried out by Waterways Ireland along the River Shannon and Lough Ree from 2018 to date.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Heritage Projects","counter":1108,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1109,"qnumday":412,"qnumall":"[19605\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000117#WRT04200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the steps she will take to collect and preserve a document (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":1110,"content":"<p>Our National Cultural Institutions have very significant expertise and experience in the matter collection and preservation of important historical artefacts and documents.

Further to these measures, my Department arranged for the payment of 50% of each local authority&rsquo;s individual Payroll and PSPR allocation, amounting to &euro;54.8m, in mid-June. This interim payment would ordinarily be paid later in July.<\/p>  <p>  To support both the local government sector and the ratepayers impacted, &euro;600m has been allocated by Government to fund the cost of a waiver of commercial rates for six months to the end of September 2020 for eligible businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This will take the form of a credit in lieu of rates.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that additional costs are being incurred by local authorities in relation to Covid-19. Local authorities have been advised to capture all related costs in their financial systems to aid future financial analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the local government sector. The full financial impacts and estimated potential deficits for 2020 have not yet been fully quantified by the local authorities. In order to support the sector generally, my Department continues to keep local authority income, expenditure and cash flow under review and will continue to work with all local authorities, both collectively and individually, on issues arising, including those issues facing Kildare County Council and all the other authorities referred to in the Deputies questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000118#WRU09400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":1235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000118#WRU09500"},{"type":"question","counter":1236,"qnumday":439,"qnumall":"[19775\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000118#WRU09600","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of affordable homes built in north County Kildare in each of the past five years;

The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Pension-Related Deductions within the meaning of Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and 2.5% for each child, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%.<\/p>  <p>  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.<\/p>  <p>  Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p>  <p>  However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will also have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordability and cost rental and will be completed when the impacts of these parallel initiatives have been considered.<\/p>  <p>  This\u00a0Government is absolutely committed to ensuring that affordable, quality housing solutions are available to everyone in Irish society, and this is reflected in the Programme for Government, &lsquo;Our Shared Future&rsquo;.\u00a0 We will put affordability at the heart of the housing system through the progression of State-backed affordable housing. Affordable Purchase and Cost Rental homes will be delivered on State and public lands through a number of channels, including by local authorities and the Land Development Agency.<\/p>  <p>  Another measure which supports affordability is the Help to Buy Scheme.\u00a0 As part of the &euro;7 billion July stimulus plan,\u00a0my colleague the Minister for Finance\u00a0recently confirmed an enhanced version of the Help-to-Buy scheme. This will allow eligible first-time buyers purchasing a newly-built home &ndash; or building one themselves &ndash; to claim back up to &euro;30,000 in income tax paid and DIRT on bank deposit interest over the last four years. Full details of the Help to Buy initiative are available at https:\/\/www.revenue.ie\/en\/property\/help-to-buy-incentive\/index.aspx\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, a new loan offering was introduced, from 1 February 2018, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.

Irish immigration to the United States, and in particular the status of the\u00a0 undocumented Irish, has been a high priority for successive Governments and it will continue to be prioritised by the new Government. Immigration issues have been continuously raised in interactions with the US Administration and political leaders, including by the then Taoiseach during his St. Patrick's Day visit to the White House in March, and more recently by the Taoiseach in high level calls to members of the US Administration. I have also raised issues of immigration in my recent contact with Special Envoy Mick Mulvaney and with the US Ambassador. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of securing future pathways for immigration, the E3 Visa Bill, which was passed in the House of Representatives earlier this year, is currently before the Senate. If passed, this could open up approximately 4,000 US visas per year to Irish graduates. Due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, Congress has many additional issues on its agenda; however we hope that when the circumstances allow, the Bill will also be passed in the Senate.<\/p>  <p>  In the US, our officials also continue to engage and advocate on behalf of the undocumented. Our Embassy in Washington, D.C. and our seven Consulates General across the US are monitoring the situation closely and are continuing to actively support Irish community groups that work with undocumented Irish citizens. They engage with US officials on immigration issues on an ongoing basis, including with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Our Mission network also works closely with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which, together with its member organisations, provides support and information to vulnerable Irish and the undocumented. This regular engagement has continued virtually in recent months due to Covid-19 restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The Coalition and its member organisations receive significant annual funding through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme for their work. In 2019 alone, over &euro;3 million ($3.7 million) was allocated to 76 organisations across the US, including those that provide front line welfare assistance to Irish citizens. Furthermore, in response to the pandemic, a dedicated Covid-19 Response Fund for Irish Communities Abroad has been set up within my Department to help these organisations meet the needs of those who have recently been made particularly vulnerable. In the past two months, both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy have met virtually with several organisations in the United States which, with the assistance of this Fund, are providing much needed emergency support to Irish communities.<\/p>  <p>  While comprehensive immigration reform is a complex and sensitive political issue in the US at\u00a0 present, our Embassy in Washington D.C. and\u00a0our Consulates General across the United States will continue to monitor the situation and stand ready to engage with any Federal and State initiatives on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000124#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Advertising","counter":1543,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000124#WRAA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1544,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[21029\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000124#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his Department has carried out advertising campaigns to promote policies or programmes being implemented by same; if so, if he will provide the details of the campaign or relevant programme; the cost of advertising in publications, broadcast advertising and outdoor advertising; the cost of consultancy or production costs in each of the past two years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1545,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade engages in public awareness advertising campaigns where there is important information that needs to be brought to the attention of the public.\u00a0 In that regard, two significant campaigns took place in 2019 and will be ongoing in 2020; the new &ldquo;Passport Online&rdquo; campaign and the &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; campaign.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>In the case of the former, the objective is to build continual awareness of the Online Passport Service for Irish citizens, which is now expanding to include children and first time adult applications.\u00a0 This campaign has a multi-faceted approach, including promotion on social media platforms, national and regional print and broadcast media, and outdoor advertising.\u00a0 Expenditure to date in 2019 and 2020 on this campaign is &euro;633,723.<\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on the &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; Public Information campaign was approximately &euro;1.5 million in 2019.\u00a0 While the costs of the 2019 campaign were borne by my Department, this is a whole of Government campaign prepared and executed in partnership with other Government Departments and Agencies, in particular, the Department of the Taoiseach.\u00a0As we move toward the closing phase of the transition period following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU the need for this work continues.

Under this &lsquo;fast accrual&rsquo; pension scheme, maximum retirement benefits accrue after 31 years. \u00a0The 21-year pension, the rate of which varies according to retiring rank and other factors, is payable for the person&rsquo;s lifetime. <\/p>  <p>  Where qualifying service is more than 21 years, an &lsquo;additional increment&rsquo; is payable at a flat rate (generally &euro;9.02 a week currently) for each year of service in excess of 21 years up to a maximum of 31 years&rsquo; service. \u00a0This gives a maximum additional increment of &euro;90.20 weekly. However, under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme rules, this additional increment ceases to be payable if and when the pensioner reaches the prescribed age for the State Pension (Contributory), that is, at age 66 to 68 depending on a person&rsquo;s date of birth.\u00a0 The question of a person&rsquo;s entitlement to a State Pension is, of course, a matter for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.<\/p>  <p>  These arrangements are in accordance with the long established principle of integrating occupational pensions with Social Insurance benefits of employees who are in full PRSI class. \u00a0This includes NCOs and Privates who are fully insured for the range of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, such as the State Pension (Contributory). \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Integration means that a person&rsquo;s entitlement to social insurance benefits is taken into account when calculating the rate of their occupational pension payable. In an integrated pension scheme, the State Pension or similar contributory Social Welfare benefit is regarded as part of the overall pension package payable to the individual. The integration principle applies right across the public service and, indeed, in many areas of the private sector as well as in other countries. <\/p>  <p>  It might be noted that the method of integration for these &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; military pensioners is more favourable than in other areas of the public service. \u00a0In the public service generally, integration begins from the time the occupational pension commences payment, for example from age 60\/65 where &lsquo;standard accrual&rsquo; pensions apply in pre-2013 public service schemes. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  NCOs or Privates enlisted before April 2004 who serve 31 years having joined the Defence Forces at age 18\/20, can qualify for maximum retirement benefits (pension and lump sum) payable immediately from age 49\/51, while those retiring with between 22 and 30 years&rsquo; service will also have qualified at a younger age for immediate retirement benefits based on their lower service.\u00a0 However, for all of them, the integration process only begins when the State Pension becomes payable, for example, at age 66. Furthermore, the maximum personal rate of State Pension payable (&euro;248.30 a week currently if under age 80) is considerably more than any reduction that could happen under the Defence Forces pension schemes by virtue of the loss of the additional increment on qualification for the State Pension. \u00a0This is the scenario for any former member who retires with between 22 and 31 years&rsquo; service under the &lsquo;pre-April 2004&rsquo; pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of the operation of these arrangements, such retired members are therefore in receipt of their full pension entitlements from my Department in accordance with the relevant pension scheme rules.<\/p>  <p>  The foregoing atypical integration arrangements do not apply to NCOs and Privates enlisting on or after 1 April 2004, and whose occupational pensions are subject to standard integration with social insurance benefits along with other public service employees insured for full PRSI.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000125#WRBB03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1620,"qnumday":610,"qnumall":"[20913\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000125#WRBB03600","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of active duty Defence Forces personnel that have died by suicide in the past 15 years; the rank of each; the barracks in which they were posted in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1610","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1621,"content":"<p>All sudden deaths that occur in the Defence Forces\u00a0are reported to the relevant Coroner's Office.

The Supply Panel Scheme will be expanded nationwide and I am allocating 200 posts to provide substitute cover through these panels.

The exchequer pays all, or part of, this contribution on behalf of almost 50% of students eligible for free fees via the Student Grant Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees Initiative, for example full-time undergraduate students who do not qualify for the free tuition fees; part-time undergraduates or; any post-graduate students, it is a matter for the higher education institution - as an autonomous body - to determine which fee rate is applicable for students.<\/p>  <p>  Planning for models of blended learning is taking place against a backdrop of an evolving public health environment and will continue to be monitored and adapted as required to ensure the health and safety of all students and staff. The balance between face-to-face and online will vary across programmes and will depend on factors such as the disciplinary teaching and learning needs of, and the numbers of students registered on individual programmes as well as the practical\/theoretical balance of learning outcomes in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  Any determination as to the level of fees to be charged is a matter for each institution in accordance with it's own particular operational conditions and circumstances in ensuring education provision for students through this pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by students and their families as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and of the importance of the Student Grant Scheme and related supports, such as the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities. These supports have a fundamental role in assisting families who are putting their children through further and higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, the following arrangements have been put in place: <\/p>  <p>  For the 2020\/21 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019.     <\/p>  <p>  The means test arrangements of the Student Grant Scheme are applied nationally. Student grant applications are means tested on gross income from all sources earned inside and outside the State within a specified reference period. In the case of both employed and self-employed applicants, gross income, before deduction of income tax or universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded. Therefore, all income is assessed from the same starting point. <\/p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children. In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time. In this way, the Student Grant Scheme is responsive to the individual circumstances of particular families.<\/p>  <p>  The income threshold for the special rate of grant has been increased from &euro;24,000 to &euro;24,500 for the 2020 scheme, so as to ensure that students from families dependent on welfare will continue to be eligible for the special rate of grant. (This reflects the Budget 2019 increase to the maximum point of the weekly State Contributory Pension, plus maximum Qualified Adult Allowance for a person over 66 years). Further information in relation to student grant assistance is available from SUSI&rsquo;s website, www.susi.ie. The telephone number for SUSI&rsquo;s Helpdesk is 0761 087 874.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists full-time and part-time students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. Institutions have the autonomy to maximise the flexibility in the Student Assistance Fund to enable HEIs to support students during the COVID-19 situation. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. Further information on this tax relief is available from student&rsquo;s local Tax Office or from the Revenue Commissioners website, www.revenue.ie<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, a substantial funding package of &euro;168m was announced on 22 July for publically funded further and higher education providers under the remit of DFHERIS and for students to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  This package of funding was developed following detailed engagement and assessment with the sector.  As part of the allocation funding in the amount of &euro;10m is being provided for student assistance and &euro;15m for the provision of devices and equipment to assist disadvantaged students in accessing education. The distribution of the funds and the principles and eligibility criteria governing the additional supports for students including in relation to access to devices will be finalised over the coming days and weeks with key stakeholders. Further details will be made available as soon as this process has been completed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1742,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1743,"qnumday":654,"qnumall":"[19750\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD02100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the ASD unit in a school (details supplied) will be opened; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1744,"content":"<p>The school referred to by the Deputy has been approved a four classroom SEN base under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme 2019.  <\/p><p>The school authority, to whom the project has been devolved for delivery, is currently in the process of appointing a Design Team and is being assisted by Dublin &amp;amp; D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education &amp;amp; Training Board (DDLETB) in that respect.<\/p><p>It is not possible at this early stage to give a definite timeline as to when the accommodation will be available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Educational Psychological Service","counter":1745,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1746,"qnumday":655,"qnumall":"[19772\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000127#WRDD02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of children in north County Kildare awaiting an appointment with a NEPS psychologist; the number waiting less than six, six to 12 and more than 12 months, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1585","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1747,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools. This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e. Some 199 of these posts are currently filled which represents the highest number of psychologists to be employed within NEPS since the inception of the service in 2000.<\/p>  <p>  Indeed the Deputy may be aware that I was pleased to announce this week the provision of an additional 17 NEPS psychologist posts as part of my Department's package to assist schools in the task of reopening in the coming school year.

Enhanced grants are being made available for cleaning to schools with special classes and special schools.<\/p><p>Funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teaching staff, SNA and administrative staff. There will be additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme will be expanded nationwide and I am allocating 200 posts to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.<\/p><p>Other funding measures for primary schools include release days for teaching principals which equates to one release day per week and release time for deputy principals in primary schools with an admin principal.  <\/p><p>There is also funding of &euro;40m for enhanced supervision for post primary schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 204 w.t.e.

(SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.\u00a0 This\u00a0reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support.

Enhanced grants are being made available for cleaning to schools with special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teaching staff, SNA and administrative staff. There will be additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools. This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes. The Supply Panel Scheme will be expanded nationwide and I am allocating 200 posts to provide substitute cover through these panels. The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required. Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Other funding measures for primary schools include release days for teaching principals which equates to one release day per week and release time for deputy principals in primary schools with an admin principal. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There is also funding of &euro;40m for enhanced supervision for post primary schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice. An additional 1,080 teaching posts at post-primary level at a cost of &euro;53 million will be provided to support the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;4.2 million will also be made available to enable schools to employ an aide to assist with implementing logistical changes. &euro;3.8m is being made available to ensure that schools have lead worker representatives, whose role is to support the school to limit the risk of COVID-19 infections.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I also recognise that the full implementation of the COVID-19 Response Plans for Schools, and the Public Health Advice, may require some reconfiguration works within schools. To support this work, a once off enhanced minor works grant will paid to all primary schools by mid-August.\u00a0 There is a one off &euro;75 million capital allocation to support schools to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening including an uplift for schools with SEN pupils. <\/p>  <p>  In providing funding to schools in this way, schools will have the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly in compliance with the Public Health Advice and the Roadmap.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The health advice for schools is that on-site temperature taking is not recommended because fever is not a consistent symptom of COVID-19 in children and would result in delayed school entry. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has developed a suite of guidance for schools dealing with the matters raised by the Deputy and also includes the provision of templates.

It has been developed in line with public health advice issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), the <i>Roadmap for Society and Business<\/i>, and follows comprehensive and intensive engagement with education stakeholders including the school management bodies and staff representatives. <\/p><p>My Department is also providing capital and current funding of an additional &euro;377 million to support the safe and sustainable reopening of schools under the Roadmap. <\/p><p>This funding includes &euro;52 million for schools to put in place enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools.  Enhanced grants are being made available for cleaning to schools with special classes and special schools.<\/p><p>Funding of approx. &euro;84.7 million so that schools can employ replacement teaching staff, SNA and administrative staff.  There will be additional funding of &euro;41.2 million, for substitution in primary schools.  This will provide more certainty on the availability of substitutes for primary schools and cover substitutions that are not covered by existing schemes.  The Supply Panel Scheme will be expanded nationwide and I am allocating 200 posts to provide substitute cover through these panels.  The purpose of supply panels is to support schools to manage the sick leave and other absences by having a supply of teachers to meet substitution needs when required.  Schools will continue to be able to access substitute teachers through the normal process, particularly if they are not connected to a supply panel.<\/p><p>Other funding measures for primary schools include release days for teaching principals which equates to one release day per week and release time for deputy principals in primary schools with an admin principal.  <\/p><p>There is also funding of &euro;40m for enhanced supervision for post primary schools to minimise the interaction of students from different classes, in line with public health advice.  An additional 1,080 teaching posts at post-primary level at a cost of &euro;53 million will be provided to support the important work of teaching and learning and provide additional teachers needed to support teacher substitution, management of physical distancing requirements by reallocating class timetables in schools to smaller groups class sizes where necessary.  <\/p><p>Funding of &euro;4.2 million will also be made available to enable schools to employ an aide to assist with implementing logistical changes.  &euro;3.8m is being made available to ensure that schools have lead worker representatives, whose role is to support the school to limit the risk of COVID-19 infections. <\/p><p>I also recognise that the full implementation of the COVID-19 Response Plans for Schools, and the Public Health Advice, may require some reconfiguration works within schools.  To support this work, a once off enhanced minor works grant will paid to all primary schools by mid-August.  There is a one off &euro;75 million capital allocation to support schools to prepare their buildings and classrooms for reopening including an uplift for schools with SEN pupils. <\/p><p>In providing funding to schools in this way, schools will have the necessary flexibility to implement necessary physical measures in their school quickly in compliance with the Public Health Advice and the Roadmap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000130#WRGG05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1994,"content":"<p>Question No. 744 answered with Question No. 672.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1995,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000130#WRGG05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1996,"qnumday":745,"qnumall":"[21040\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000130#WRGG05400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of school building projects at primary school level throughout northern areas of County Kildare in hand or at planning stage that are likely to continue uninterrupted with a view to meeting anticipated opening dates; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":1997,"qnumday":747,"qnumall":"[21042\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000130#WRGG05500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the primary and second level school development and-or replacement projects that are in progress at all primary and second level schools in Naas, County Kildare; the extent to which original timelines are likely to be met; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

Where a person is an employee their gross average weekly income for either 2019 or the months of January and February 2020 is used, whichever is the more favourable.

The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.<\/p><p>As at 25th July, there are 6,315 rent supplement customers in payment awarded\u00a0since the 13th March 2020 with an average tenancy cost for the scheme\u00a0of &euro;685 per month. There are 925 cases awaiting a payment decision or yet to supply all documentation needed to allow the officer dealing with the case to make a decision. The\u00a0total associated costs\u00a0for both cases awarded and pending is in the region\u00a0of\u00a0&euro;59.5m, fully annualised. The attached tabular statements provide\u00a0a rolling monthly\u00a0average cost per claim for the periods requested; and\u00a0a county analysis of rent supplement recipients awarded since 13th March 2020 and\u00a0still in payment as at 25th July 2020. Statistics in relation to overall refusal rates\u00a0for the scheme are not currently available, while approximately 1,000 cases, awarded since 13th March, no longer receive RS support as they have returned to work.<\/p><p>In the context of the Covid emergency, the position is that for persons to be eligible for Rent Supplement, once it has been confirmed that they are a bona fide tenant, the two standing qualification criteria apply:<\/p><p>The customer was in receipt of Rent Supplement in the last 12\u00a0\u00a0months before the date of application; or,<\/p><p>The customer\u00a0was living in private rented\u00a0accommodation prior to the Covid emergency (at least 4 weeks),\u00a0could afford their rent at the beginning of the tenancy and\u00a0were now unable\u00a0to continue to pay the rent because of a substantial change in their circumstances.<\/p><p>The principal underlying criteria for access to the Scheme have not changed: an applicant receiving a primary social welfare payment or reduced income with an identifiable rental commitment can apply.

(MESL)\u00a0is an assessment, developed by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice,\u00a0of the minimum income needed to live and partake in the social and economic norms of everyday life for various household types.<\/p><p>The model produces a minimum income standard which is dependent on whether the household is, among other factors:<\/p><p>(i) in a rural or urban location;<\/p><p>(ii) composed of a single working age person, a couple, a single- or two-parent family, a single pensioner or a pensioner couple; and<\/p><p>(iii) living in private rented accommodation, social housing or is an owner-occupier.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card and, as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly.\u00a0 While the model assumes that pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package, it does not assume this for working age people.\u00a0 Certain working age recipients of welfare payments do qualify for Free Travel &ndash; recipients of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, and Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, for example.<\/p><p>Bringing weekly working age social welfare rates in line with the MESL entails increasing the maximum personal rate to &euro;250 and\u00a0the Qualified Child Increase to &euro;48.20 for children under 12 and &euro;94.70 for children aged 12 and over.\u00a0 There would be no proportionate increase in the current rate for\u00a0Qualified Adults in order to meet the MESL.<\/p><p>The estimated full year cost of implementing these measures is &euro;2.51 billion.\u00a0 This costing\u00a0is subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revisions of the estimated numbers of recipients.<\/p><p>Any change to the current process of setting social welfare rates would require Government approval and would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.\u00a0 This would include taking

These conditions\u00a0do not apply to people aged 62 and over.\u00a0 However, they can still avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from my Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.\u00a0\u00a0Special arrangements have also been made so that people in this age group only have to register with their Intreo Centre once a year and so they do not need to

In\u00a02018 \u00a0almost 120,000 grants were paid to family carers\u00a0totalling &euro;203.96 million. <\/p><p>At the end of June 2020, almost 127,000 grants were paid to carers receiving the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit or Domiciliary Care Allowance and to other full-time carers who are not receiving any of these payments.\u00a0 The estimated expenditure on the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant this year is &euro;237.32 million.<\/p><p>It should be noted that the data for 2020 only covers the grants paid up to the end of June 2020. It is expected that further applications will be received\u00a0before the closing date. Applications for\u00a0the 2020 grant can be submitted up until 31 December, 2021.<\/p><p>The estimated additional cost of increasing the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant from &euro;1,700 to &euro;2,000 would be of the order of &euro;42m per year.<\/p><p>I will continue to keep the range of supports provided by this Department under review and consultations with carer&rsquo;s representative groups will continue to ensure that the overall objectives of the carer income support schemes provided are met. However, any changes to the current carer income supports provided by this Department would have implications for overall spending and would need to be addressed in an overall budgetary context. <\/p><p>I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000135#WRMM04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment","counter":2310,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000135#WRMM04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2311,"qnumday":866,"qnumall":"[20323\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000135#WRMM04700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if an application for the reduced pandemic unemployment payment by a person (details supplied) can be reviewed in view of the fact their details were incorrectly reviewed initially; and if their payment can be allocated according to their correct income details.","asker":"1555","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":2312,"content":"<p>From the 29th June the rate of Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) which a person receives will depend on their gross weekly employment earnings as follows;<\/p><p>- For those whose prior gross earnings were &euro;200 per week or higher (about 75% of recipients), the PUP payment rate remains at &euro;350 per week;<\/p><p>- For those whose prior gross earnings were up to &euro;199.99 per week (about 25% of recipients), the PUP payment rate is &euro;203 per week.<\/p><p>- A person who was in receipt of JA\/JB as a part-time or casual worker immediately prior to receipt of PUP will remain on the rate of &euro;350 irrespective of their previous earnings.<\/p><p>The rate of PUP is based on prior earnings notified to Revenue.

The Act makes provision for third-party submissions and establishes the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC).  <\/p>  <p>  The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).  These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the FAC and others.  These findings meant that in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes to the licensing system were unavoidable. All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.  <\/p>  <p>  I am acutely aware that delays in issuing licences have led to difficulties for some in the sector. Felling licences are now valid for up to 10 years and may cover several felling events, such as thinning then clear felling on the same plot.  Landowners considering future operations, have the opportunity of applying for a tree felling licence well in advance of any operations taking place.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is intensively engaging with all relevant stakeholders on these issues.  I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately meant that the current backlog has arisen.  It has taken substantial resources and effort to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place. A large majority of our licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications which includes significant investment in extra resources required to deliver the plan. These resources are a combination of additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required.  <\/p>  <p>  The project plan is a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an increased number of licences being issued in the short-term and will deliver a return to expected timelines in the longer term.  Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.   <\/p>  <p>  A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.  There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries, is a key element of the project.  While much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department, stakeholders also need to engage with it.  This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit applications that are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided. In addition, the Government has agreed to a number of amendments to the Appeals Act in order to align the forestry licensing system with other planning systems, and this will streamline the system and make it more efficient. <\/p>  <p>  I am more than aware that the current situation is challenging, but it is a temporary disruption which, when resolved, will make for a better, more sustainable and fit-for-purpose forestry licensing system for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000137#WROO04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Young Farmers Scheme","counter":2443,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000137#WROO04600"},{"type":"question","counter":2444,"qnumday":913,"qnumall":"[19549\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000137#WROO04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will address a matter in relation to young farmers (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1602"},{"type":"speech","counter":2445,"content":"<p>Teagasc is the primary education provider for the farming community\u00a0delivering a wide range of programmes on a full-time, part-time and distance education basis including the Green Cert Programme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am advised that Teagasc\u00a0has not cancelled any courses arising from COVID 19.

The current licensing difficulties are as a result of the changes made to internal Appropriate Assessment Procedures (AAP).\u00a0 These were introduced in response to important Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) decisions and their subsequent interpretation by the Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) and others.\u00a0 These findings meant that\u00a0in order to grant licences which fully meet environmental requirements, fundamental changes\u00a0to the licensing system were unavoidable. \u00a0All licence applications are subject to a statutory public notification system.\u00a0<\/p><p>I accept the current changes to procedures are very significant and they have been challenging to implement such is the scope and breadth of them, which has unfortunately\u00a0meant that\u00a0there have been delays in issuing licences. \u00a0It has taken substantial resources and effort\u00a0to introduce a robust and workable system, which meets the legislative requirements, and I believe we now have that in place.\u00a0a majority of\u00a0my Department's\u00a0licensing decisions are being confirmed at the Forestry Appeals Committee which gives confidence in these revised procedures. \u00a0<\/p><p>My Department has a detailed project plan in place for dealing with the current backlog and new applications, which includes significant investment in extra resources\u00a0required to deliver the plan. These resources\u00a0are a combination of\u00a0additional ecologists, forestry inspectors and administrative staff where required. \u00a0<\/p><p>The project plan is\u00a0a targeted, process-driven approach which prioritise files in a manner which will result in an\u00a0increased number of licences being issued\u00a0in the short-term\u00a0and will deliver\u00a0a return to expected\u00a0timelines in the longer term.\u00a0 Applicants who have or are prepared to submit a Natura Impact Statement, where appropriate, will be prioritised.<\/p><p>A Project Management Board, with a dedicated Project Manager, will oversee and monitor delivery.\u00a0 There will be a continuous review of the process, in order to effect efficiencies. A\u00a0communication plan to keep stakeholders fully and regularly\u00a0informed of progress, with a dedicated central resource to deal with queries,\u00a0is a key element of\u00a0the project.\u00a0 While\u00a0much of the success of the project plan lies with my Department,\u00a0stakeholders also need to engage with it. \u00a0This will require a commitment from forestry companies to submit only applications which have a realistic chance of being planted, to ensure all applications are of the required standard and quality, and to submit NISs in accordance with the guidance provided.\u00a0<\/p><p>In terms of improvements to\u00a0the current approval system, a comprehensive review\u00a0which involved extensive stakeholder consultation, was conducted by Mr. Jim Mackinnon, CBE, and his recommendations are outlined in the Mackinnon Report. There is a commitment under the Programme for Government to implement the Mackinnon Report, and to review the forestry appeals process to ensure that it is aligned with other comparable appeals processes. I am considering how best this might be achieved and expect to be announcing some\u00a0changes in this regard in the coming weeks. \u00a0<\/p><p>The Forestry Appeals Committee (FAC) is operationally independent of my Department.

Article 17 of the Common Fisheries Policy; and the process for weighting or prioritising the criteria.","asker":"1525","askee":"1602"},{"type":"speech","counter":2485,"content":"<p>In Ireland, fish quotas are a public resource owned by the State and are made available to fishing vessels based on an overall policy framework which has been developed over the past 30 years.\u00a0 The key commercial whitefish quotas (cod, haddock, monk, hake etc) are managed on a monthly basis with maximum catch limits set for vessels.\u00a0 Pelagic stocks such as mackerel and herring are managed on an annual or seasonal basis with catch limits set based on allocation regimes developed over many years and primarily related to historical catch records.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The allocations are not owned by the vessel and when an allocation is not fished, it can not be transferred to another boat but is returned to the State for redistribution to the fleet in the normal way.\u00a0 The substantial advantage from a macro perspective of these arrangements is that it retains an Irish owned and operated fleet which makes the bulk of its landings to Irish ports and bases its operations in Ireland. If the fleet were not Irish owned, there would be a rapid concentration of ownership in a small number of international companies which are not likely to operate from Ireland and may not have any \u00a0commercial links with Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that within the EU, most quota systems have been privatised for their main commercial stocks.\u00a0 In the UK for example, the bulk of quotas available to England have been purchased by international companies with limited connections to their coastal communities.\u00a0 In Ireland, it has been long standing policy to ensure that our quotas are not privatised and this has been a policy of Governments over the decades. The result of this long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels who have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has strongly supported the introduction of more selective fishing gear to reduce catches of juvenile fish and unwanted by-catches.\u00a0\u00a0Fishing gear trials\u00a0in our main fisheries have been carried out in collaboration with our fishing sector.\u00a0 A number of\u00a0changes to fishing gear and practices which demonstrate improved selectivity have been adopted at EU level following recommendations from the North West Waters Member States Group\u00a0 (Ireland is a key player in this Group) and most recently as part of the TAC and quota Regulation adopted in December 2020.\u00a0 These measures support building more sustainable fishing practices in the waters around Ireland.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, national measures are adopted from time to time, informed by the experiences of our fisheries, most recently the setting of a minimum mesh size for our important nephrops fishery and setting conditions for gear used in this fishery that are additional to measures adopted at EU level.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  From time to time, the quota system is used to incentivise the introduction of environmentally friendly fishing gear in particular fisheries or for particular types of vessels usually in advance of seeking to implement change at EU level.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland has introduced a ban on trawl fishing inside its 6 nautical mile\u00a0zone.\u00a0\u00a0These measures aim to provide ecosystem benefits, including for nursery areas and juvenile fish stocks. They are also intended to facilitate the further sustainable development of the small scale inshore and the sea-angling sectors which strongly rely on inshore waters<\/p>  <p>  The Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC)\u00a0takes into account the importance of supporting the landing obligation in the allocation of quotas.\u00a0 The recommendations for allocations for each period for by-catch stocks for the Irish fleet are aimed at the catch composition in our mixed fisheries.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  National Policy for Quota Balancing has been put in place for pelagic and demersal stocks. Where a vessel exceeds its catch limit for a relevant pelagic or demersal stock, a balancing adjustment is made from future allocations of fishing opportunities.\u00a0Furthermore, where a vessel has reported landings of a pelagic stock for which it does not hold a valid authorisation\/notification at the time of the fishing operation, such landings will be subject to quota balancing and a balancing adjustment is made from a future allocation of a fishing opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of economic criteria,\u00a0demersal fisheries catch limits generally take account of the length of fishing vessels with large vessels being allocated double that of smaller fishing vessels; the market situation for fish; and in certain fisheries the allocation takes into account the type of fishing gear deployed.\u00a0 In pelagic fisheries, allocations take account of historic activity for the relevant fleet segment.\u00a0 Within these allocations, it has regard for the length of fishing vessels and or the historic fishing pattern of the vessels in the segment. <\/p>  <p>  BIM, Ireland&rsquo;s seafood development agency, carries out the socio-economic assessment to examine the potential effects of the annual fishing opportunities proposal. The assessment is carried out on a stock by stock basis as well as a regional analysis of fishery areas. The methodology of the assessment utilises data that is collected nationally within the EU and so allows timely estimation of possible social impacts as a result of changes in total allowable catches that could affect national fishing fleets and fishing dependent communities. The assessment also covers the potential social impacts that can extend to a broad set of characteristics such as employment, wages and downstream impacts at a regional level.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish fish quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, a fair and rational allocation of quotas between fishing vessel operators and management to support fishing seasons and the availability of by-catch quotas during the year. The management arrangements have been set and developed over many years since the commencement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and the introduction of quotas.\u00a0 Any amendments or changes to the policy on management arrangements are determined by the Minister of the time following\u00a0detailed analysis and full consultation with stakeholders.\u00a0 Allocations and other arrangements are decided by the Minister on an ongoing basis having regard for the advice of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC).\u00a0 This Committee is a formal consultative committee, involving fishing industry representatives from the catching, inshore and processing sectors.\u00a0 The QMAC is in place at the discretion of the Minister and is chaired by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  The QMAC currently meets on a monthly basis. The purpose of these meetings is for the industry representatives to make recommendations to the Minister on monthly\/bi-monthly\/quarterly catch limits for particular demersal stocks.\u00a0 The Minister has regard for the recommendations, subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries. Additional meetings are organised as required to discuss specific issues in particular fisheries that may arise. <\/p>  <p>  The QMAC operates by examining in detail each month the operation of each fishery, available quota and uptake patterns for the different metiers of fishing vessels, including inshore fishing vessels. There are detailed discussions each month on the catch limits taking account of the divergent situation of the fleet, including that of smaller inshore fishing vessels, and of the market. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000138#WRPP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"question","counter":2487,"qnumday":927,"qnumall":"[20134\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000138#WRPP01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the incentives provided to fishing vessels to use selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact; the number of quota holder incentives provided since 1 January 2018; the number that them are small-scale vessels (details supplied); the percentage of fishing vessels registered here they constitute.; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1602"},{"type":"speech","counter":2488,"content":"<p>Ireland has strongly supported the introduction of more selective fishing gear to reduce catches of juvenile fish and unwanted by-catches.\u00a0 Fishing gear trials have been carried out in our main fisheries working in collaboration with our fishing sector.\u00a0 A number of changes to fishing gear and practices which demonstrate improved selectivity have been adopted at EU level following recommendations from\u00a0 the North West Waters Member States Group\u00a0(Ireland is a key member of the Group) \u00a0and most recently as part of the TAC and quota Regulation adopted in December 2020.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, national measures are adopted, informed by the experiences of quota management, most recently the setting of a minimum mesh size for our important nephrops fishery and setting conditions for gear used in this fishery that are additional to measures adopted at EU level.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  From time to time, the quota system is used to incentivise the introduction of environmentally friendly fishing gear in particular fisheries or for particular types of vessels usually in advance of seeking to implement change at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently no financial incentives in place in respect of the use of selective fishing gear or using fishing techniques with reduced environmental impact.\u00a0 Schemes for Nephrops were operated from September to December 2017, March to May and June to August 2018.\u00a0 The purpose of the Nephrops schemes was to promote the use of more selective fishing gear in the Nephrops fishery.\u00a0 The intention was to promote the use of fishing gears that had demonstrated the escape of unwanted catches, in particular (i) small Nephrops and (ii) small and\/or quota-limited whitefish such as cod, whiting, haddock and black sole. <\/p>  <p>  In the March to May 2018 scheme for Nephrops, there were\u00a0five applicants of which four were in respect of vessels under 12\u00a0metres in length overall (80% of the total number of applicants).

Therefore, it was critical to address this risk as part of the eradication programme. Commencing in 2002, systems were put in place whereby serious breakdowns of bTB were investigated by a state veterinarian. If evidence was established of infection being introduced by badgers, this would trigger a survey for signs of badger activity and to identify the location of badger setts.\u00a0 A targeted removal program would follow the completion of these surveys which involved trapping\/removing badgers within a 2Km radius of the affected farm, and by this means the local badger densities would be maintained at an average of 0.5 badgers Km<sup>2<\/sup>, which is below the 2-3 badgers Km<sup>2<\/sup>normally found in the areas of Ireland where cattle are grazed\/farmed.\u00a0 By 2016 roughly one third (33%) of the agricultural land of the country was part of DAFMs wildlife program area, and maintaining the local badger populations at the 0.5 badgers Km<sup>2<\/sup>target resulted in roughly 6,000 badgers being removed each year.<\/p><p>This policy is recognised as playing a crucial role in reducing bTB herd incidence from over 6.5% in 2002 to the low point achieved in 2016 of 3.27%.

Results have informed and supported the development of the current badger vaccine policy which was formally launched by my Department in January 2018.\u00a0 The research proved that Bacillus Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin vaccine (BCG) (which is used in humans) can be used in badgers to generate sufficient immunity to address the risk of TB following a large field trial carried out in a 755 Km<sup>2<\/sup>area in Kilkenny over the period 2009-2012.\u00a0 This trial showed that BCG did protect vaccinated badgers in the wild, and that it provided levels of protection (the scientific term is efficacy) of 60% (i.e. 6 out of 10 vaccinated badgers are protected by BCG).\u00a0 A complementary trial (Non-Inferiority Trial) ran in areas in six (6) counties during the period 2014-2017, where capture\/vaccination\/release of badgers in areas was compared with capture\/remove in other areas in the same counties and this trial has shown that vaccination\/release can be substituted for long-term continuous culling of badgers once the densities of badgers in a bTB endemic area are first reduced by the targeted culling program which is implemented by DAFM.<\/p><p>My Department announced in January 2018 that the policy of vaccination of badgers would now be part of the TB eradication programme,\u00a0and will eventually replace a majority of the current culling program.\u00a0 Beginning by expanding the vaccination areas in the initial counties where vaccine is used (counties Cork, Galway, Kilkenny, Longford, Louth, Monaghan, Tipperary and Waterford) substituting vaccination for culling will be\u00a0 rolled out, on a phased basis, to every county.\u00a0 The removal of badgers from areas with severe cattle TB outbreaks which are epidemiologically linked to badgers will continue, where necessary to reduce the risk of TB to cattle and the level of TB in the badger population.<\/p><p>Converting the current unvaccinated population of badgers in bTB endemic areas to a predominantly vaccinated badger population will result in fewer TB infected badgers and fewer instances of badgers infecting other badgers or cattle, and so,\u00a0in conjunction with other cattle focused measures and controls, will ultimately facilitate the final eradication of bTB from Ireland&rsquo;s cattle population.<\/p><p>The number of badgers that have been culled and vaccinated respectively in each year since 2010 and to date in 2020 are set out in the following table: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Culled<\/th>       <th>Vaccinated<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2010<\/td>       <td>5,607<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2011<\/td>       <td>6,679<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2012<\/td>       <td>6,736<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2013<\/td>       <td>5,902<\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2014<\/td>       <td>6,161<\/td>       <td>*1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2015<\/td>       <td>5,895<\/td>       <td>*1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016<\/td>       <td>5,816<\/td>       <td>*1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017<\/td>       <td>5,464<\/td>       <td>*1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018<\/td>       <td>5,360<\/td>       <td>*1,000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019<\/td>       <td>4,976<\/td>       <td>1,618<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020<\/td>       <td>2,428<\/td>       <td>2,513<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Vaccination of badgers in 2018 continued at the levels experienced during the trials, i.e. at a rate of approximately 1,000 per year<\/p><p>The 2018 End of Year Report for the Department&rsquo;s Wildlife Unit is available at:<\/p><p>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000138#WRPP06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1602"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tuberculosis Incidence","counter":2537,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000138#WRPP06200"},{"type":"question","counter":2538,"qnumday":944,"qnumall":"[20242\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000138#WRPP06300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of instances of tuberculosis reported in 2019 and to date in 2020; the number of farms affected; the number of tuberculosis instances associated with suckler herds; the number associated with dairy herds; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1602"},{"type":"speech","counter":2539,"content":"<p>The information\u00a0requested\u00a0is set down in the Table below.

A phased programme for the infrastructural development of Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been progressed over the last number of years, which has seen a significant investment. In total, approx &euro;31m has been invested in capital developments at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC between 2000 and 2019. In addition, in excess of &euro;1.5m has been allocated for capital works in the harbour in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  The possibility of a deep-water berthing project at Ros an Mh&iacute;l FHC has been mooted for some time. The Department commissioned DKM consultants to conduct a Cost Benefit Analysis into the development of a deep water quay at Ros an Mh&iacute;l.  A draft report was submitted to the Department in June 2017. While positive, the Department had reservations with the report and never formally accepted it. The cost of this report was &euro;28,500.<\/p>  <p>  Since the report was drafted, there have been changes to some of the fundamentals underpinning the original analysis. In 2018, the Department subsequently commissioned engineering consultants to undertake a review of the design solutions, scoping options and operational aspects of a possible future project.

This report identified the need for additional site investigations to be carried out in Ros an Mh&iacute;l. <\/p>  <p>  These site investigation works were carried out in August\/September 2019 and have now been completed. The final Quay Wall Peer Review report was received on 27th July 2020.

These policies seek to support children&rsquo;s optimal development, to support families, and to ensure that families can choose options to best suit their needs and preferences.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  All children are eligible to avail of two years of universal pre-school provided under the ECCE Programme, without cost. More than 100,000 children participate in\u00a0this Programme annually, many of whom are children of stay-at-home parent(s).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under the National Childcare Scheme, a universal subsidy is available to all parents of children from six months until their child becomes eligible for universal pre-school, regardless of whether parents are working outside the home or not. Income assessed subsidies are also\u00a0available to parents, including stay-at-home parents. \u00a0The Programme for Government commits to \u00a0continued investment in this Scheme, reducing costs for parents and introducing greater parental choice and flexibility<\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding for parent and toddler groups to organise activities for parents and children in the community to support their development through play. Both working parents and stay-at-home parents\u00a0participate.\u00a0\u00a0There were 414 such groups supported in 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A new model of parenting services is also being developed covering key stages of child development and taking account of parents and children in a range of contexts and parenting relationships.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  More widely across Government, there are various initiatives that support stay-at-home parents. A child benefit payment of &euro;140 per child per month is available for all children.\u00a0 When one spouse or civil partner works in the home caring for one or more dependent people (a child for whom\u00a0Child Benefit is payable is considered a dependent), then a home carer tax credit can be claimed. Budget 2020\u00a0 increased the home carer tax credit to &euro;1,600 per year.\u00a0 The Programme for Government has committed to further increases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There have also been a number of new measures to support parents to spend time at home with children in their early years. Two weeks of paternity leave and benefit for fathers was introduced in 2016. In 2017, there was an extension to maternity leave and benefit to mothers of babies born prematurely.\u00a0 2019 saw the introduction of a new paid parental leave scheme available to both fathers and mothers. The Parent&rsquo;s leave aims to let working parents spend more time with their baby or adopted child during the first year. In November 2019, an individual entitlement to two weeks of paid parental leave per parent (up to a potential four weeks in total per child)\u00a0was introduced. The Programme for Government commits to further extensions to this individual entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  There has also been an extension since September 2019 of unpaid parental leave from 18 to 22 weeks under the Parental Leave Amendment (Act) 2019.\u00a0 A further 4-week extension from September 2020 will bring the amount of unpaid parental leave to 26 weeks.

Included in these schemes are conditions which improve affordability for parents. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Childcare Scheme, which operated while services were closed on public health grounds, included a condition that parents were not charged fees for the closure period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My\u00a0Department&rsquo;s Reopening Support Payment, to support services reopening between June and early September, included a commitment not to increase fees charged to parents from pre-COVID-19 levels. This applies for the duration of the reopening period (29 June to 23 August 2020). This condition is to ensure that fees for parents are not raised during this period, and to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s aims of affordable ELC and SAC continue to be met. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the recently announced funding package for the sector from 24 August to the end of the year commits to a substantial investment of just under &euro;300 million, mainly\u00a0through the Revenue operated Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme and full resumption of DCYA ELC and SAC programmes. These DCYA\u00a0programmes reduce fees by providing State subsidies which must be passed on to parents. \u00a0I hope that this package will mean that services will not increase parental fees given that, on average, 38% of their costs are now being met through the EWSS alone. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000140#WRRR06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":2680,"qnumday":995,"qnumall":"[19748\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000140#WRRR06600","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his plans to examine options to increase flexibility within centre based care in addition to options to accelerate access to subsidies for non-relative childminders as set out in the Programme for Government; if terms of reference and tenders for this examination have been initiated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":2681,"content":"<p>A central task in increasing flexibility in access to early learning and care and school-age childcare is to make subsidies available to a wider cohort of childminders than is currently able to access subsidies. A report on options will be completed by year-end, building on work already undertaken to develop a Childminding Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 an expert Working Group on Reforms and Supports for the Childminding Sector was established. In March 2018 the Working Group published its report Pathway to a Quality Support and Assurance System for Childminding, which set out a number of recommendations on the development of appropriate supports and changes to regulations required for childminders. <\/p>  <p>  Building on the recommendations of the Working Group report, in August 2019 my Department published a Draft Childminding Action Plan, for the purpose of public consultation. The Draft Childminding Action Plan set out short, medium, and long-term measures on a phased basis for childminders to formalise their position over the next decade. Proposals included extending subsidy schemes and other supports to all paid, non-relative childminders, and extending the scope of regulation to childminders to provide quality assurance and safeguards for children.<\/p>  <p>  An extensive public consultation on the Draft Childminding Action Plan took place in quarter 4 of 2019. A report was commissioned to consider the findings of the consultation process. Officials in my Department are currently preparing to publish the consultation report and the conclusions from the report will guide the development of a report on plans for childminding to be finalised by the end of the year. <\/p>  <p>  There is already considerable flexibility in options for centre-based care. The National Childcare Scheme, introduced in 2019, offers flexibility to accommodate different models for delivery of both early learning and care and school-age childcare, for service providers that are registered with Tusla, the statutory regulator. The National Childcare Scheme can accommodate full flexibility in relation to types of service provision, location, hours of operation, and ages of both pre-school and school-age children catered for. The National Childcare Scheme is designed to be responsive and flexible, allowing income thresholds, maximum hours and subsidy rates to be adjusted in line with Government decisions and as more investment becomes available.<\/p>  <p>  Measures to support further flexibility in options available include capital funding programmes for new and extended provision of centre-based services. Recent annual capital funding rounds have been able to support parents' access to places for under 3 year olds and for school-age children. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, my Department has used the funding that was allocated for this year&rsquo;s capital programme to provide grants to assist with the costs of supporting early learning and care and school-age childcare services to reopen and adhere to public health requirements. This grant will include enabling services to adhere to the reopening guidelines by improving hygiene facilities and outdoor play areas.

The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School Age <\/p>  <p>  - Review the existing approach to funding Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage <\/p>  <p>  - Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives <\/p>  <p>  - Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government. <\/p>  <p>  An essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC and SAC and make childcare more affordable for parents.<\/p>  <p>  The work of the Expert Group is well underway.\u00a0Six meetings of the Group have been held to date and documentation from these meeting is publicly available at www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  A research partner has also\u00a0been appointed to deliver evidence-based working papers to the Expert Group.\u00a0 Working papers on international approaches to funding, fees, staff wages and public investment in Ireland compared to other countries; potential mechanisms to control fees charged to parents, approaches to identifying children and\/or services in need of additional support, and working conditions within the sector, have already been carried out and these are now being considered by the Expert Group. Other papers are under development. Working papers will be published from later this year. <\/p>  <p>  The Expert Group is committed to engaging with key stakeholders, including children, families, providers and the workforce,\u00a0in developing this funding model.

This has enabled, for example,\u00a0a\u00a0doubling of the ECCE programme to two years, a doubling of the number of children availing of State subsidies, a 60% increase in ELC and SAC places,\u00a0greater access to ELC and SAC for children with additional needs and development of the new National Childcare Scheme.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government acknowledges that more needs to be done to tackle the challenges of accessibility, affordability and quality of ELC and SAC and that more investment is needed.<\/p>  <p>  First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families pledges to at least double State investment in ELC and SAC by 2028.\u00a0 It also commits to ensure this additional investment delivers for children, families and the State . <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reform projects committed to in First\u00a05 and\u00a0in the Programme for Government\u00a0that have relevance to the recommendations of the INFORM report, including the review of the operating system, the development of a new funding model for ELC and SAC, and the development of a Workforce Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  This week I announced that I will shortly establish an Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) to commence a review of the operating and oversight model used to support accessible, affordable and high quality ELC and SAC services. \u00a0The operating model resulting from the review should better\u00a0support service providers, operate transparently and accountably, provide value for money to the Exchequer and demonstrate good governance. The model would enable appropriate linkages and effective working relationships with all other agencies and Departments charged with delivering better outcomes for children and families.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group to develop\u00a0the new funding model has been convened and work is well underway. This\u00a0Group is composed of renowned academics, top level economists and experienced policy makers from Ireland and elsewhere\u00a0&ndash; all of whom have an enormous breadth of knowledge and experience. The Expert Group&rsquo;s Terms of Reference are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Agree a set of guiding principles to underpin the new Funding Model for Early Learning and Care and School Age<\/p>  <p>  - Review the existing approach to funding Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare services by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in terms of its alignment with the guiding principles as well as effectiveness in delivering on the policy objectives of quality, affordability, accessibility and contributing to addressing disadvantage<\/p>  <p>  - Drawing on international evidence, identify and consider options on how additional funding for Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare could be structured to deliver on the guiding principles and above policy objectives <\/p>  <p>  - Agree a final report including a proposed design for a new Funding Model, with accompanying costings, risk analysis and mitigation and phased implementation plan (with funding likely to become available on an incremental basis) to recommend to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and ultimately Government. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Six meetings of the Group have been held to date and documentation from these meeting is publicly available at www.first5fundingmodel.gov.ie.<\/p>  <p>  A research partner has also\u00a0been appointed to deliver evidence-based working papers to the Expert Group.\u00a0 Working papers on international approaches to funding, fees, staff wages and public investment in Ireland compared to other countries; potential mechanisms to control fees charged to parents, approaches to identifying children and\/or services in need of additional support, and working conditions within the sector, have already been carried out and these are now being considered by the Expert Group. Other papers are under development. Working papers will be published from later this year. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Preparation of a\u00a0Workforce Development Plan for the ELC and SAC sector is also well underway. \u00a0This \u00a0will set out plans to raise the profile of careers in the sector, establishing role profiles, career pathways, qualification requirements, and associated policy mechanisms, along with leadership development opportunities and measures to deliver\u00a0a more gender-balanced and diverse workforce. <\/p>  <p>  In all of this work, DCYA is\u00a0committed to continuing to engage with key stakeholders, including children, families, providers and the workforce. Owing to COVID-19, a series of regional consultation events due to take place in March had to be cancelled.

It provides for the review by the wardship court of the capacity of all current adult wards of court within three years of the commencement of Part 6 of the 2015 Act.\u00a0In each case, the ward shall be discharged from wardship and the court shall order that the property of the former ward be returned to him or her.\u00a0The safeguards and procedures of the 2015 Act will apply to a former ward who transitions to any of the new decision-making support arrangements available under the 2015 Act.\u00a0 The current wards of court system will continue to operate until Part 6 of the 2015 Act is commenced.\u00a0It is not possible to commence Part 6 of the Act until the DSS is operational and ready to roll out the new decision-making support options that will be available under the 2015 Act.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A range of amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 have been identified as necessary for the proper operation of the 2015 Act, taking account of issues raised by the Mental Health Commission, the working groups developing draft codes of practice under the 2015 Act, and submissions received from other bodies.\u00a0 The amendments to the 2015 Act will be brought forward by way of a stand-alone Bill.\u00a0 Work is ongoing in\u00a0my Department on the General Scheme, with a view to Government approval being sought as soon as possible for the priority drafting of the Bill. <\/p>  <p>  The implementation of the 2015 Act also requires that the DSS is fully operational and in a position to offer services including the new decision-making support options. A high-level Steering Group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission, the Courts Service and the HSE, together with the Director of the DSS, is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the DSS and this work is ongoing. The Steering Group has given detailed consideration to the feasibility of commencing the remaining provisions of the Act however, due to the complexity of the Act and the interconnectivity of its provisions, it is not possible to make any further commencement orders until the DSS is operational. The DSS, led by its Director, is working\u00a0on putting\u00a0in place the necessary infrastructure to support the full commencement of the Act. The infrastructure required includes, amongst many other elements, ICT capability for the DSS. These preparations are being\u00a0implemented under the oversight of the Steering Group and will allow for commencement orders for the main operative provisions of the 2015 Act to be made when the necessary preparations have been completed to enable the DSS to roll out the new decision-making support options.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department has sought and received funding, through the Estimates process, over the last three years to assist the DSS in delivering on its mandate. Further funding will be\u00a0necessary through the Estimates process in 2020 and 2021. In the interim, and subject to the funding allocation, my Department, in conjunction with the DSS, the Mental Health Commission and other stakeholders have agreed to an implementation plan which anticipates commencement of DSS services in mid-2022. There\u00a0are also critical dependencies for the DSS on other organisations, including, for example, the Courts Service, the HSE and the\u00a0Department of Health amongst others, which need to be delivered in order to achieve this timeline. The Steering Group has been meeting regularly to ensure a coordinated approach to the implementation of this project.<\/p>  <p>  As this is a function that is due to transfer, it will of course be a matter for my colleague,\u00a0Mr. Roderic O'Gorman, T.D.,\u00a0the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to bring this matter forward.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Stations","counter":2737,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS04700"},{"type":"question","counter":2738,"qnumday":1014,"qnumall":"[19590\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS04800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the timeline for Rush Garda station to be opened.","asker":"1564","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2739,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware\u00a0that the Office of Public Works has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.\u00a0 Works in relation to Garda accommodation are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW).<\/p>  <p>  I am advised that the works required to reopen Rush Garda station have been completed and that the building has been handed over by the OPW to the Garda authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed however, that in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the IT works which will be required prior to Rush station becoming operational have not yet been carried out.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, and as the Deputy may be aware, as part of its action to mitigate the risks around the transmission of COVID-19 between Garda personnel and\/or members of the public, Garda management has identified a range of alternative accommodation including educational institutions, local community facilities and so on, which are available to Garda management across the country in order to assist in protecting members and staff against COVID-19.\u00a0 I understand that these facilities, where in use, are acting as a facility supplementary to the local Garda Station, to ensure compliance with social distancing guidelines, minimising the concentration of personnel in a particular location.\u00a0 This contributes to the protection of Garda members and staff and to the organisational resilience of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I am informed that, in a similar context, Rush station is currently being held as a contingency building, in the event other stations become impacted by COVID-19 infection.\u00a0 I am further advised that when the public health situation allows, Rush Garda station will reopen to the public.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Refugee Resettlement Programme","counter":2740,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS05000"},{"type":"question","counter":2741,"qnumday":1015,"qnumall":"[19591\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000141#WRSS05100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of persons who arrived here under phase 1 of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme 2015-2019 who have progressed to independent living in local communities by relocated persons, resettled persons, IHAP beneficiaries and other.","asker":"1564","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":2742,"content":"<p>The Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP) was established in 2015 to deliver upon Government commitments to accept up to 4,000 people into the State in response to the migration crisis in central and Southern Europe.

The Act was one of our national undertakings in support of structural reform, national competitiveness and economic recovery under the EU\/IMF\/ECB Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy Conditionality of 28<sup>th<\/sup>November 2010.\u00a0 The early deadline for the publication of the Bill was met and it commenced its passage through the Oireachtas with D&aacute;il Second Stage on 16 December 2011. The Bill was one of a series of competing legislative priorities which had to be met in support of national recovery including, for example, in response to the very pressing issues of insolvency, bankruptcy and personal debt. <\/p><p>In more specific terms the Bill delivered our Troika undertakings to establish an independent regulator for the legal profession; to implement the recommendations of the Legal Costs Working Group, and to implement the outstanding recommendations of the Competition Authority to reduce legal costs. <\/p><p>The subsequent progress of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 and its detailed debate before both Houses up to enactment in December 2015 are a matter of public record on the Oireachtas website. The implementation of the Bill and other undertakings of the Troika Programme are also a matter of public record both in their regular reporting by Government to the Houses and in the form of the Reviews of the Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland published several times each year by the European Commission between 2011 and 2013. This was followed by a series of post-programme surveillance reports by the Commission, the latest of which was published last Autumn. An &lsquo;Ex Post Evaluation&rsquo; of the programme for 2010 to 2013 is also publicly available with all of these documents and their accompanying financial information on the website ec.europa.ie.\u00a0 Full details of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, its budget and roll-out of functions and its annual and other statutory reports which have been laid before the Houses, are publicly available on its website www.lsra.ie. <\/p><p>In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy about the operation of the legal services regulatory regime, under the Solicitors Acts dating back to 1954, the Law Society has been the designated body for the regulation of solicitors in the State and the Solicitors&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal has dealt with cases of serious professional misconduct. With the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 by my predecessor Minister Charlie Flanagan with effect from 7<sup>th<\/sup>October 2019, we are now setting up the new Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal which is entirely independent of the Regulatory Authority and the legal professional bodies in the exercise of its functions. The Tribunal which is due to come into operation later this year, will deal with allegations of serious misconduct by all legal practitioners, whether they be solicitors or barristers. While the Solicitors&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal is now being wound down in response to the new regulatory regime, matters already before it under the previous legislation will have to be completed under the applicable law which applied for that purpose including under the relevant review and appeal structures set out in the Solicitors&rsquo; Acts. This is entirely separate from the new statutory functions of the LSRA.<\/p><p>However, under the new regulatory regime of the 2015 Act allegations of professional misconduct by solicitors and barristers are no longer dealt with through their professional bodies as was previously the case. Rather, they are considered independently by the Regulatory Authority, whose Complaints Committee may refer relevant matters of serious misconduct to the new and separate Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. <\/p><p>In relation to the time allowed under the 2015 Act for the bringing of complaints about legal practitioners, I would point out that there is no time limit on the bringing of complaints about professional misconduct before the regulatory authority. The three-year period referred to by the Deputy relates only to more minor services and costs issues which would fall short of professional misconduct. This is solely intended to support clients in seeking to resolve matters of this nature by more informal means.<\/p><p>In relation to the total expenditure by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority since its establishment \u00a0in October 2016 the situation is as set out in the following table.<\/p><p><b>LSRA Expenditure by Year 2016 to 2019<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year<\/th>       <th>Total Expenditure<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Oct 2016-31 Dec 2017<\/td>       <td>&euro;871,839<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1 Jan 2018- 31 Dec 2018<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,294,903<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1 Jan 2019-31 Dec 2019<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,653,549<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The Deputy will also wish to be aware that under Part 7 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, the LSRA is also funded by an annual levy on those legal practitioners who come within the terms of its regulatory functions based on the actual expenditure of the Authority in the preceding financial year.

This service provides all employees with immediate support from accredited counsellors, over the telephone and then, if needed, up to eight face-to-face counselling sessions. These sessions take place in a location within one hour of the employee&rsquo;s home or place of work.

It includes various interventions including Critical Incident Stress Debriefing, Peer Support, Bereavement and Self Care Education.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that 'Connecting for Life' is Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide 2015-2020. Connecting for Life sets out a vision of an Ireland where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and wellbeing. A Cross-Sectoral Group comprising high-level representatives from Government Departments and key State agencies including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been established to support the implementation of Connecting for Life.<\/p><p>With regard to the number of Garda&iacute; placed on sick leave due to stress or mental illness, I am informed by the Garda authorities that sickness absences are recorded and reported under the following categories &ndash; Ordinary Illness; Occupational Injury\/Illness Arising from Duty and Critical Illness. <\/p><p>There is currently no specific sub-category on the Sickness Absence Management System for the recording of absences due to stress but, in some cases, this is recorded under the Mental Health sub-category or in the comments field against another sub-category.

The Decision Support Service is working towards being operational and ready for the commencement of the main provisions of the Act in 2020.\u00a0 This lead-in timeframe ensures that the necessary staff resources, processes, IT system, expert panels, codes of practice and regulations will be in place so that the Decision Support Service will have the capacity to be up and running effectively. <\/p>  <p>  The Government continues to take practical measures to improve the lives of people with disabilities.\u00a0 The Report of the Make Work Pay Group was published in April 2017 and many of its recommendations have been implemented. In addition, the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities 2015-2024 includes positive action measures to support the recruitment of people with disabilities in the public service and in the wider economy.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the practical measures outlined, the Deputy will be aware of a number of legislative developments to support the implementation of the Convention.<\/p>  <p>  In the first instance, the Minister for Health is progressing Heads of a Bill to provide legislative clarity on the issue of deprivation of liberty. A report of a recent public consultation on these draft legislative provisions is nearing completion, and every effort is being made to progress this legislation as quickly as possible. <\/p>  <p>  In order to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s laws on liberty and security of the person as they relate to persons with a disability and to ensure that Ireland fully complies with Article 14, the Government has been working towards enacting specific legislation. The previously stated Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 and the ADMC each have an important role in this regard. In addition, a stand-alone Bill on Deprivation of Liberty is being progressed. The Bill will provide procedural safeguards to ensure that people are not unlawfully deprived of their liberty in relevant facilities. <\/p>  <p>  An approach has been developed to provide for situations in which an individual lacks the capacity to consent to their care arrangements (which amount to a deprivation of liberty) and will provide a legal basis for these care arrangements to be authorised by a body to be established within the health service.\u00a0 The authorisation will not cover any other decision to be made in relation to that individual e.g. financial decisions or consent to medical treatment. Work to refine the draft legislative proposals is ongoing and complicated policy issues that have arisen are being resolved, in consultation with an Advisory Group and relevant stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016, which contains key legislative amendments needed for compliance with the Convention, was published in December 2016. The Bill includes provisions to establish the monitoring framework required by Article 33 of the Convention to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. It requires the involvement and participation of civil society, in particular, persons with disabilities, in the monitoring process. <\/p>  <p>  Published in December 2016, the Bill&rsquo;s stated purpose was to address remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).\u00a0 The opportunity was also taken to progress other miscellaneous amendments to statute law. The Bill amends:<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the Juries Act to accommodate (i) deaf persons who need the services of a sign language interpreter and (ii) persons with mental illness being subject to a functional capacity test<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the Electoral Act to repeal the prohibition on a person of unsound mind from standing for election to the national and European parliament<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the National Disability Act to (i) change the status of NDA staff from public to civil servants, in line with all other bodies in the Justice Vote and (ii) to provide information and advice including statistics to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the Equal Status Act to elaborate the principle of refusal of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; on grounds of cost<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the Disability Act to bring civilian staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the scope of Part V of that Act which contains measures applicable to the public service including employee quotas<\/p>  <p>  &bullet;the IHREC Act to create a statutory basis for IHREC to (i) keep under review the law and practice relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, and (ii) to that end appoint an advisory committee, and (iii) apply to the Court of Appeal to appear as amicus curiae (friend of the court).<\/p>  <p>  The Bill was at Committee Stage when it lapsed with the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and Seanad in January 2020. A decision is now required as to whether the lapsed Bill should be revisited, or if a new Bill should be drafted. This will be a decision for the new Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and Integration once the transfer of functions from the Minister for Justice and Equality has taken place. <\/p>  <p>  The monitoring framework for implementation of the Convention will include both the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) and the NDA and will be governed by a formal Memorandum of Understanding. This will ensure the direct participation of persons with disabilities and the organisations representing them in monitoring how the Convention is implemented in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000143#WRUU05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services","counter":2874,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000143#WRUU05300"},{"type":"question","counter":2875,"qnumday":1066,"qnumall":"[19554\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000143#WRUU05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to address inadequacies in HSE diabetic care in County Clare and the UL Hospitals Group (details supplied);

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections.

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 9 July 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time.

The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An information portal that will contain the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is being developed.

To date, Government has approved COVID 19 Pandemic Health service funding of &euro;2bn.

In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and made considerable\u00a0improvements to\u00a0access for patients waiting for high volume procedures including cataracts. At the end of July 2017, the number of people waiting for a cataract procedure was 10,024. As of the end of June 2020, there were 6,023 patients waiting for a cataract procedure. Of these, 1,039 are waiting over 9 months which represents a reduction of 76% when compared to July 2017, when there were 4,249 waiting over 9 months.<\/p><p>A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. <\/p><p>In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p><p>NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the\u00a0pausing of all non-urgent health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.<\/p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge.

This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the\u00a0pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. <\/p>  <p>  Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (www2.hse.ie\/services\/hospital-service-disruptions\/hospital-service-disruptions-covid19.html).<\/p>  <p>  To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p>  <p>  As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised by the Deputy concerning colonoscopies, as this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000146#WRYY04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":3083,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000146#WRYY04100"},{"type":"question","counter":3084,"qnumday":1137,"qnumall":"[19874\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000146#WRYY04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacancies at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital, Dublin;

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8 July 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An information portal that will contain the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is being developed. After August 4th service users and families will be able to access this information on www.hse.ie\/newdirections. <\/p>  <p>  It has been recognised that additional costs may arise for service providers in providing safe services. To date, Government has approved COVID 19 Pandemic Health service funding of &euro;2bn. The aim of this funding is to support investment necessary to address COVID 19, to mitigate risk of the spread of COVID 19 and to facilitate the provision of health and social care services against the backdrop of COVID 19.

NPHET advises the wearing of a non-medical face covering in a number of circumstances including in retail outlets, by people visiting the homes of those who are cocooning, by people who are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning, by visitors to residential care facilities and in indoor work environments where it is difficult to maintain a two-metre distance. I would again emphasise that the wearing of face coverings is an additional hygiene measure and should not take the place of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette and other personal protective public health measures. Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and with individuals washing their\u00a0hands before putting them on and taking them off. <\/p>  <p>  On Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020 (S.I. No. 244\/2020). The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public (excluding children under the age of 13) shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable excuse includes where a person:<\/p>  <p>  -  cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress<\/p>  <p>  -  needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury<\/p>  <p>  -  removes the face covering to take medication\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  It is not my intention to develop guidelines in relation to the operation of the Regulations. The Regulations provide that a &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo;, defined as an officer, employee or agent of a public transport operator or of the National Transport Authority, who is responsible for the implementation of the Regulations and it is, therefore, a matter for the public transport operators and the National Transport Authority to make arrangements for what they consider necessary to ensure that such &ldquo;relevant persons&rdquo; are satisfied with the information provided by any individual who is using a public transport service. <\/p>  <p>  As I am sure will be appreciated, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings is constantly evolving. I can assure you that the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). \u00a0The Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public.\u00a0The development of Regulations is this regard is underway and it is likely that similar &ldquo;reasonable excuse&rdquo; provisions will be included. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/facecoverings. <\/p>  <p>  www2.hse.ie\/conditions\/coronavirus\/face-masks-disposable-gloves.html.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000146#WRYY07500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Health Insurance Card","counter":3118,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000147#WRZZ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":3119,"qnumday":1149,"qnumall":"[19909\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000147#WRZZ00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the arrangements that have been made with the United Kingdom for residents in Northern Ireland who hold Irish passports in applying for a EHIC card in view of the fact that they cannot apply through the HSE as they do not have a PPS number (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":3120,"content":"<p>Arrangements for European Health Insurance Cards remain in place until the end of the transition period.

The Guidance to support the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services was published by the HSE on 8 July 2020. <\/p>  <p>  In developing the guidance document to guide providers, the HSE worked closely with service providers through representative organisations such as the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, Disability Federation of Ireland and the Not for Profit Association, in addition to Inclusion Ireland, who represent people with intellectual disabilities and their families.<\/p>  <p>  The guidance document seeks to support the safe return of services in the context of ongoing public health guidance. It also recognises that the impact of public health guidance will result in services being provided at a reduced level and will require changes in how people are supported, increased use of technology where appropriate and more use of outreach supports.<\/p>  <p>  Day services will gradually resume during the month of August. Service providers are already working to get day services ready to reopen safely, and in line with public health guidance. Service providers will be in touch with all families and service users during the month of July to discuss when they may expect the resumption of their service and what that service will consist of.<\/p>  <p>  I want to acknowledge the many challenges experienced by individuals and their families over this difficult time. Families across the country have had their routines upended due to the impact of COVID-19 and I hope that this will be the first step towards returning to some sense of normalcy.<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An information portal that will contain the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is being developed. After August 4th service users and families will be able to access this information on www.hse.ie\/newdirections. <\/p>  <p>  It has been recognised that additional costs may arise for service providers in providing safe services. To date, Government has approved COVID 19 Pandemic Health service funding of &euro;2bn. The aim of this funding is to support investment necessary to address COVID 19, to mitigate risk of the spread of COVID 19 and to facilitate the provision of health and social care services against the backdrop of COVID 19.

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the HSE had to take measures to pause most elective scheduled care activity with effect from the end March 2020. This was to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. This decision was in line with the advice issued by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) and in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines, and the National Action Plan. <\/p><p>The trajectory of the disease means there is now an opportunity for increasing the provision of non-Covid care including more routine care. NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the\u00a0pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. <\/p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().<\/p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.<\/p><p>Please see attached document outlining the endocrinology outpatient waiting list at St Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital.

The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, the latest leaflet &ldquo;Adult Disability Day Services and COVID-19 - What&rsquo;s Happening? July 2020&rdquo; is available at the above link. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An information portal that will contain the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations will reopen around the country is being developed. After August 4th service users and families will be able to access this information on www.hse.ie\/newdirections. <\/p>  <p>  It has been recognised that additional costs may arise for service providers in providing safe services. To date, Government has approved COVID 19 Pandemic Health service funding of &euro;2bn. The aim of this funding is to support investment necessary to address COVID 19, to mitigate risk of the spread of COVID 19 and to facilitate the provision of health and social care services against the backdrop of COVID 19. The HSE is in the process of reviewing and validating business cases from disability services providers for additional funding to support the reopening of services.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question refers to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply to the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000149#WRBBB05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ophthalmology Services","counter":3318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000149#WRBBB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":3319,"qnumday":1217,"qnumall":"[20177\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000149#WRBBB05400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of persons on the waiting list for ophthalmology in counties Cavan and Monaghan;

however, I have endeavoured to provide as much information as possible, in order to provide assurance regarding the new maternity hospital on the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Campus.<\/p><p><i>St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG<\/i>will be established under the Companies Act as a not for profit company; it will be a company with charitable status and will be governed by Irish company law.  The constitution of <i>St. Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG<\/i>has been approved by the Charities Regulator and has been published on the St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group (SVHG)  website at; www.stvincents.ie\/constitutions-svh-clg-and-svhg\/. The Constitution makes no reference to Canon Law, and I am advised that Canon Law will not impact on the Company. <\/p><p>A legal framework is being developed to protect the State's investment in the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH) and to ensure that the hospital remains in State ownership.  The legal framework, when finalised, will be brought to Government for approval. <\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park are encompassed in the <i>Mulvey Agreement<\/i>, which was finalised following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the SVHG.  The <i>Mulvey Agreement<\/i>provides for the establishment of a new company <i>- National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC<\/i>- which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. The Agreement ensures that a full range of health services will be available at the new hospital without religious, ethnic or other distinction.  <\/p><p>I would like to emphasise that the <i>Mulvey Agreement<\/i>represents an accommodation of the views of the two voluntary hospitals, together with consideration of key policy objectives, including clinical independence, no religious influences to be brought to bear on the new hospital and assurance that the State's investment will be protected.  The Deputy can be assured that these overriding objectives will be copperfastened through the legal framework.<\/p><p>In line with the <i>Mulvey Agreement<\/i>, the Board of the <i>NMH at Elm Park DAC<\/i>will comprise 9 directors; 4 nominated by SVHG, 4 by NMH, and 1 will be an international expert in obstetrics and gynaecology. Given the level of State investment, the previous Minister for Health sought, and received, the agreement of both the NMH and SVHG that the Board of the new NMH DAC will be competency-based and will include a Public Interest representative.<\/p><p>With regard to the composition of the Board of <i>St Vincent&rsquo;s Holdings CLG<\/i>, information published on the SVHG website indicates that this Board will comprise independent directors who will be appointed based on their competencies and skills. This information can be accessed @: www.stvincents.ie\/app\/uploads\/2020\/05\/ST.VINCENTS-HOLDINGS-CLG-Information-Sheet-14.05.2020.<\/p><p>Finally, I am very conscious that the buildings at Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.

Face coverings should be used properly, in line with the guidance and hands should be washed before putting them on and taking them off. I do not have plans to provide face coverings at this time. They are readily available in retail outlets and online. Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on gov.ie\/facecoverings and the HSE website.<\/p><p>On 15 June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign\u00a0 which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:<\/p><p>- who should wear face coverings<\/p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020. The regulations provide that, from 13 July 2020, members of the public shall not, without reasonable excuse, travel by public transport without wearing a face covering.<\/p><p>Reasonable excuse includes where a person:<\/p><p>- cannot put one on, wear or remove a face covering because of any physical or mental illness, impairment or disability or without severe distress<\/p><p>- needs to communicate with another person who has difficulties communicating<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to provide emergency assistance or to provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to avoid harm or injury, or the risk of harm or injury<\/p><p>- removes the face covering to take medication.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>The Regulations do not apply to children under the age of 13 years.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Government has now also agreed to the mandatory wearing of face coverings in retail outlets, shops and shopping centres. Retail staff will also be obliged to wear a face covering unless there is a partition between them and members of the public or where there is a distance of 2 metres between them and members of the public. Work on the development of relevant Regulations has commenced and it is likely that similar &ldquo;reasonable excuse&ldquo; provisions will apply .<\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving. I can assure you that the public health advice relating to Covid-19 is kept under continuing review by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). The Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the NPHET has also been proactively examining all relevant evidence relating to the virus and the issue of face coverings. The EAG has requested the Health Information and Quality Authority to prepare a revised and updated evidence synthesis on face coverings and I have been informed that this paper is expected to be finalised shortly.<\/p><p>The latest public health advice on face coverings is available at the following links and is updated on a regular basis:<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000154#WRGGG02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":3650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000154#WRGGG02900"},{"type":"question","counter":3651,"qnumday":1333,"qnumall":"[20584\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000154#WRGGG03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children and adults on the dental appointment waiting list in County Kerry;

The Task Force report was published in December 2017 and it was suggested that the time-frame for full implementation should be three years.  The report made recommendations in 10 different themed areas.  It also identified lead agencies associated with each recommendation that would be tasked with developing and\/or implementing these as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  Since publication of the Task Force report, a number of the recommendations have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies for 2018\/2020.  The implementation of these recommendations has been ongoing since publication of the report and many major areas of priority have been delivered.  In this regard, there have been several online support projects delivered to support online counselling, online CBT training and online signposting; Schools have upskilled staff in mental health training and many disciplines have availed of mental health first aid training; Early intervention projects such as perinatal training and family support projects have launched.  Health and wellbeing projects have been supported and many NGOs have been supported to deliver local youth-specific mental health initiatives nationally through mental health funding, Sl&aacute;intecare funding and Healthy Ireland community funding.  In addition, the HEAI committed to establishing additional counselling supports to higher level students and the Department of Children worked to deliver first five and LGBTQ+ actions. <\/p>  <p>  A small number of recommendations require\u00a0further consideration and related to this, approval is currently being sought from DPER to establish a Pathfinder inter-departmental unit on youth mental health.  In addition &rsquo;Sharing the Vision &ndash; a Mental Health Policy for Everyone&rsquo; advocates that access to mental health supports be based on individual need.  This means that care plans should consider the needs of the whole individual regardless of age, gender or socio-economic profile.  Sharing the Vision emphasises the need for establishing a National Implementation and Monitoring committee to ensure that all policy recommendations are implemented within the timeframe provided in the framework.  This will ensure that young people&rsquo;s needs remain prioritised over the lifetime of the policy, taking over from where the Youth Mental Health Task Force Report ends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000156#WRJJJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Suicide Incidence","counter":3793,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000156#WRJJJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":3794,"qnumday":1381,"qnumall":"[20662\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000156#WRJJJ02400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of children under 18 years of age that died by suicide in 2019;

This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site ().<\/p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.<\/p><p>In relation to endoscopy services, a national programme was established in mid-2016 to coordinate several activities to improve endoscopy services. The Endoscopy Programme is housed within the Acute Operations Division of the HSE and the programme is overseen by the National Endoscopy Steering Group.

Deputy will be aware, currently there is no specific legislation in Ireland governing assisted human reproduction (AHR), although there is limited existing regulation relating to certain aspects of the AHR area.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Given the lack of specific regulation in this area, the Government approved the drafting of a bill on AHR and associated areas of research, based on the published General Scheme of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill. \u00a0This comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation encompasses the regulation, for the first time, of a wide range of practices, such as advanced AHR treatments like in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme also provides for the establishment of an independent regulatory authority for AHR, and a number of the main envisaged functions of this body relate to the licensing of AHR treatment providers and ensuring their compliance with the provisions of the legislation.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The drafting of the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill is ongoing by my officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. \u00a0It is not possible at this time to give definitive timelines for the completion of the draft Bill, its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, or its enactment.\u00a0 However, the enactment of the Bill is included in the Programme for Government.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Interlinked with the legislation, a model of care for infertility has been developed by my Department and the HSE, which will ensure that infertility issues will be addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.\u00a0 It will comprise three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary (i.e., Regional Fertility Hubs) and then, where necessary, tertiary care (i.e., IVF, ICSI and other advanced AHR treatments).\u00a0 Structured referral pathways will be put in place and patients will be referred onwards for further investigations or treatment as required and as clinically appropriate.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Phase One of the roll-out of the model of care is underway this year and has been focused on building up services at secondary level, specifically by the development of Regional Fertility Hubs. \u00a0It is intended that Phase Two of the roll-out will include the introduction of tertiary infertility services, including IVF and ICSI, in the public health system.<\/p>  <p>  While AHR treatment is not currently funded by the Irish public health service, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE.\u00a0 Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements are prescribed by a consultant\/specialist and the cost of the medicines is then covered by either a Medical Card or the Drugs Payment Scheme.\u00a0 Given the costs associated with some fertility medicines, these schemes have a material impact on the total cost of AHR treatment for those who avail of them.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Finally, and as referred to by the Deputy, there is other support available in that patients who access ICSI treatment privately may claim tax relief on the costs involved under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme.\u00a0 Generally, this relief can be claimed at the standard tax rate of 20%.\u00a0 Taxation policy overall is a matter for the Minister for Finance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000157#WRKKK05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental

Guidance on how to make and safely use face coverings is available on <i>gov.ie\/facecoverings<\/i>and the HSE website.<\/p><p>On 15 June, the Government and the National Transport Authority launched a national communications campaign which outlines best practice for the use of face coverings in retail outlets, on public transport and in other public locations in which it is difficult to maintain social distancing or where this distance cannot be guaranteed, and are communicating to the public about:<\/p><p>- who should wear face coverings<\/p><p>- in what settings, and how to wear and remove face coverings correctly.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, on Friday 10 July 2020, having consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Justice and Equality, I signed the Health Act (Covid-19)(Face Coverings on Public Transport) Regulations 2020.

Work on the development of relevant Regulations has commenced and it is likely that similar &ldquo;reasonable excuse&ldquo; provisions will apply .<\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, the evidence relating to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the discussion around face coverings, masks and shields is constantly evolving.

NPHET has since revised its recommendation on the\u00a0pausing of all non-essential health services, with a recommendation that the delivery of acute care be determined by appropriate clinical and operational decision making. <\/p><p>Application of the essential risk mitigating steps set out in the guidance developed under the auspices of the NPHET Expert Advisory group will have operational implications, which will impact on throughput.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Where possible, hospitals are working to find innovative ways to enable service provision, which include virtual clinics for some outpatient department appointments. The HSE website provides details on services currently available and operational in each hospital on its website. This information is reviewed frequently and provides up-to-date announcements on services available at each site (  ).<\/p><p>To ensure services are re-introduced in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, the HSE launched its Strategic Framework for &lsquo;Service Continuity in a Covid Environment&rsquo; on 24 June.\u00a0 Its implementation will ensure service resumption is done in an integrated way. This will involve a phased approach to ensure community services are strengthened. The Framework will also consolidate new ways of working and build on international knowledge. Further detail regarding the phases of service resumption are contained in the HSE&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Safe Return to Health Services&rsquo; document, published on their website on 22 July.<\/p><p>As the system continues to deliver Covid-19 and non-Covid 19 care side-by-side over a more prolonged period, my Department and the HSE will continue to work closely together to protect essential non-Covid 19 acute care and progress the provision of more routine non Covid-19 care.<\/p><p>In relation to endoscopy services, a national programme was established in mid-2016 to coordinate several activities to improve endoscopy services. The Endoscopy Programme is housed within the Acute Operations Division of the HSE and the programme is overseen by the National Endoscopy Steering Group. The programme team consists of a Clinical Lead, Training Lead, Nurse Lead and Programme Manager. The team are supported by the National Endoscopy Working Group.<\/p><p>The aim of the programme is to improve the delivery of endoscopy services across all Hospital Groups.<\/p><p>The Endoscopy data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the attached document. <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"2\">Naas General Hospital GI Scopes Waiting List June 2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>0-1 Mth<\/td>       <td><div>225<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1-2 Mths<\/td>       <td><div>37<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2-3Mths<\/td>       <td><div>42<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>+3 Mths<\/td>       <td><div>1293<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total <\/td>       <td><div>1597<\/div><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000159#WRMMM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":4017,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000159#WRMMM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":4018,"qnumday":1459,"qnumall":"[20998\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020073000159#WRMMM03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of vacancies at Portlaoise Hospital;
