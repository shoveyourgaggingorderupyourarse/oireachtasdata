Since then, we have seen a global outpouring of solidarity for the Black Lives Matter movement and an increasing and most welcome focus on the vile problems of racism and discrimination.  While it may be that this moment was prompted by recent events in one state, the reality is that racism and racial discrimination are not unique to any one country or continent.  Racism is insidious.  It is present to some degree in every society, including Ireland.  Recognising this terrible reality is the first step in combating it.  We need to face up to the fact that racism does occur in Ireland.  We need to understand better how prevalent it is and what its impacts are, and we need to generate effective strategies for tackling it.  The Minister of State and I will speak this morning about some of the extensive efforts being made to tackle racism in Ireland and I will deal with the criminal justice sector.<\/p>  <p>  The sad fact is that a small minority of persons in Ireland subject others to abuse or attack due to their own prejudice or intolerance.  I wholly and unreservedly condemn such actions for which there is really no excuse.  The mission of the Department is delivery of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland.  In our policies and initiatives we strive to deliver on this mission statement.  As Deputies know, there is existing law in the area of hate crime and hate speech.  With regard to sentencing for criminal offences, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 states that a hate motive may be considered by a court to be an aggravating factor resulting in a stronger penalty.  It has been clear for some time this has not been sufficient to deter or sufficiently respond to a crime in which the victim is targeted.  Recognising that this legislation is complex and sensitive, the Department has carried out comparative research on the effectiveness of various approaches to hate crime legislation in various jurisdictions.  It is not enough just to have legislation on the Statute Book, it is essential that such legislation is effective.<\/p>  <p>  If we are to ensure that Ireland is fully inclusive, it is important that the criminal justice system reflects and represents all of society.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is pivotal in this context.  In recent years, Garda recruitment campaigns have made significant efforts to attract candidates from minority communities, including through the publication of videos and materials in multiple languages.  The Garda Commissioner has approved changes to the Garda uniform to allow the wearing of hijabs or turbans in order to ensure that the uniform does not act as a barrier to entry.  These developments are bearing fruit.<\/p> <p>For example, in 2019 and to date in 2020, almost 67 persons of 19 different nationalities born outside the State have applied to become members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition to Garda members who are UK or EU citizens, we now have members who are nationals of Brazil, China, India, Iraq, Nigeria, Russia and South Africa, among others.<\/p> <p> A Garda diversity and integration strategy has also been adopted.  This is important for organisational and operational reasons.  The strategy reflects a commitment to further diversity in the Garda workforce.  It contains a working definition of hate crime to ensure that garda&iacute; are alert and in a position to appropriately record incidents of hate crime.  It commits to a proactive and respectful engagement with all members of society, including minority groups.  These undertakings are underpinned by the Garda human rights strategy, the code of ethics and the wider reform process under way as a result of the work of the Commission on the Future of Policing.  Effective criminal legislation will be the key in deterring and addressing hate-motivated crime and a renewed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to benefit from ever-increasing diversity.  Engaging in all communities will be a powerful force for integration and respect.<\/p> <p> Addressing prejudice and discrimination is a mission for all of us.  I am confident that I am not alone in being profoundly moved by the poem \"You don't get to be racist and Irish\" recently composed by the singer Imelda May.  She reminds us of the piercing truth that our history as a people, during which we have experienced the torment of discrimination, exclusion and intolerance, means that we cannot be blind to the same terrible wrong being done to others.  Our pride in our heritage and history must extend to taking pride in our fairness, tolerance and inclusivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700003#A00200","speaker":"1589","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592382900,"counter":8,"content":"<p>The Minister has already made it clear that the Government condemns all forms of racism in our society.  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this very important issue.<\/p>  <p>  A recent key development in the fight against racism has been the formation of the anti-racism committee, which has a mandate to develop a new anti-racism strategy and action plan for recommendation to the Government.  The purpose of the committee is to develop an understanding of the nature and prevalence of racism in Ireland, including anti-Traveller racism, and to work towards achieving a social consensus on actions required by State and non-State actors.  Chaired by Professor Caroline Fennell of University College Cork, it will review current evidence and practice and make recommendations to the Government on how best to strengthen its approach to tackling racism in all its forms.  The committee will consult stakeholders from a broad range of sectors.  It will hold its first meeting tomorrow and will provide a report to Government within three months, with a full report due at the end of one year.<\/p>  <p>  Central to our efforts to improve integration is the migrant integration strategy, which I launched and have chaired since 2017 and which runs until the end of this year.  It presents the vision of an inclusive society where all can fully participate and where diversity is valued.  Racism in all its forms is a barrier to that vision being realised.  Our work to date implementing this strategy and monitoring its progress together with our NGO partners in the strategy committee has helped to build our understanding of where more effort is required and what we need to do to ensure that all members of our society feel that they belong and are valued.<\/p>  <p>  Racism is not experienced by Travellers alone.  Travellers, Roma and other ethnic minorities encounter racism and prejudice in their daily lives.  The Government has worked actively to promote opportunities for Travellers and to recognise their rights.  The landmark development has been the recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority.  Those Members who were present on the night of 1 March 2017, when the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, made a statement recognising Travellers as an ethnic minority will agree that it was a truly memorable event, with all political parties united in support of the his statement.  Recognition of Traveller ethnicity has been a symbolic step forward in the State's acknowledgement of the uniqueness of Traveller culture and identity and it generates mutual understanding and respect between Traveller and non-Traveller communities.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of Travellers as an ethnic minority did not remove overnight all the obstacles that have prevented them from experiencing full equality within Irish society.  However, it has created a strong platform of respectful dialogue and a pathway towards equality for Travellers.  It also demonstrates the commitment of Government towards recognising the contribution that Travellers have made to society and culture in Ireland.  The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 suggests specific actions in combating discrimination and ensuring equality for Travellers, as well as actions relating to celebrating and promoting the richness of Traveller culture, which is an important part of our country's heritage.<\/p> <p>Last December, I reported to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which was held in Geneva, on actions that Ireland has taken since 2011 to promote equality and to combat racial discrimination, including measures to strengthen the human rights infrastructure so that it can challenge racism more effectively.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 introduced the equality and human rights positive duty, providing structural underpinning for action by public bodies on equality, human rights and the combatting of discrimination, including racism.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has been given a range of powers to challenge discrimination, including against ethnic minorities, and to seek legal redress for persons experiencing discrimination.  One of its functions under the Act is to encourage the development of a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State.<\/p> <p> I believe in the power of communities when it comes to bringing about lasting change.  In 2017, I launched the communities integration fund, which supports local initiatives by migrant and non-migrant groups to promote integration and, most importantly, to allow people to get to know each other.  Some 124 organisations received funding in 2019 and projects are being funded which are explicitly intended to challenge racism at grassroots level.  The 2020 call for applications will be officially launched by the Department this Friday.  I have also sought to strengthen the participation of communities in welcoming refugees to Ireland and was inspired by the community sponsorship model developed in Canada, whereby local communities sponsor refugee families to settle in their towns and villages.  I saw first-hand when I visited similar projects in the UK how the integration outcomes were improved for refugees when the communities and neighbours took part in the resettlement process.  Following a successful pilot programme in Meath and Cork, I formally launched refugee community sponsorship in Ireland in November of last year.<\/p> <p> I would like to remind Deputies that the majority of Irish society has been remarkably open and welcoming to migrants from across the world.  Our diversity is our wealth.  Some 17% of our population were born outside of Ireland and many have been given the opportunity to acquire Irish citizenship.  Ireland is one of the 13 EU member states that provide citizenship if the person has been resident for five years and one of the 16 member states permitting dual citizenship.  Approximately 120,000 people have received Irish citizenship since 2011, which represents more than 2.5% of the total Irish population and our country is better and richer as a consequence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700004#B00200","speaker":"1515","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592383500,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Niall Collins and Christopher O'Sullivan.  The vast majority of Irish people detest racism because they recognise that at its core, it has the persecution of and discrimination against certain groups of people because of the colour of their skin, their ethnicity or their nationality.  It is important to point out that the Irish people are in a good position to speak about racism because for centuries we were the object of persecution and discrimination.  It is important that we recall that for the purpose of seeing how we dealt with it and how we got to a stage where the persons who previously persecuted us are our friends.  If one looks back on Irish history to the Tudor conquest in the 16th century, one can see that was a form of racist ethnic cleansing.  If one looks at what happened with the Cromwellian campaign during the English Civil War, one sees another example of people being targeted and persecuted because of their ethnicity and nationality, namely Irish.<\/p>  <p>  We can also learn from international history that the big bodies of work that institutionalised racism were both colonialism and imperialism.  If one looks at places with the worst examples of racism, one sees that at the back of them there was a colonial power exerting imperial influence.  If one looks at what happened to the people of Congo when King Leopold II of Belgium had influence over that territory, one can see the horrific consequences of such colonialism.  We also need to recognise that in other parts of the world, the reason there are racism problems today is the impact of history on those societies.  It may be said that imperialism did not play as significant a part in the history of the United States as it did in European and African countries, but the core of the problem that exists in the United States today is the history of slavery, segregation and institutional racism that existed there both prior to and after the American Civil War.  It is deeply regrettable that some 170 years after the American Civil War, issues concerning racism have still not been adequately dealt with.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that the two most powerful influences in our time, namely globalisation and social media, play a big role in promoting racism and also in standing up to racism.  One of the benefits of globalisation and social media is that people are outraged when they see a form of social injustice, not just in their city or country but anywhere in the world.  That is why so many Irish people went out to march against the persecution of black Americans by certain police officers, as was evidenced in the brutal killing of Mr. Floyd.<\/p> <p>That is a positive influence of globalisation and social media, and social media contribute in the sending out of that message.  Similarly, however, globalisation and social media can have a very negative impact because they allow racists - and they exist - to spread their hate online and to get into the minds of impressionable young people.  Unfortunately, one of the consequences of social media is that people are now compartmentalised into different groups, and algorithms tell them what they should read after reading a certain article.  This brings them further and further into more unacceptable and racist narratives.  That is why we have to be so extremely careful that our young people are given a counter-narrative.<\/p> <p> The State has an important role to play in combating racism.  Racism exists in Ireland.  I know that.  We all know that.  I know a young mixed-race couple who are subjected to vicious racism, not all the time but frequently, when they go out socialising.  As the legislative body of this country, we have to ensure we put in place laws to stand up to racism.  However, it is more than laws that are required to defeat racism; it is a culture.  We need to recognise that racism is socially completely unacceptable, and once we do that we will defeat it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700005#C00200","speaker":"1553","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592384100,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I join the previous speakers in condemning all forms of racism in this country.  I agree that as a society and as a people we are not racist.  Unfortunately, however, there is a small minority who engage in racism, and it is beginning to creep and grow among our population and our community.  That is very regrettable.  It goes without saying that we have to recognise that our hate crime legislation has been largely absent in dealing with the modern forms of racism which are prevalent among people who promote racism.  The Government should do more through our local authority structures to promote better integration of our immigrant community, because we know it is our immigrant community, our minorities, the LGBT community and the Traveller community who are most impacted by racism.  Local authorities have not done enough to step up to the plate and integrate migrants in our communities with the wider community.  That role needs to be looked at and expanded upon.  In last year's local elections many parties - the Minister's party, the Labour Party, my party and perhaps others I am not aware of - stood candidates from diverse backgrounds.  We had a good candidate elected in Limerick city, Councillor Azad Talukder, who came from Bangladesh.  He has done great work in promoting and seeking to integrate the migrant community and will shortly become the deputy mayor of Limerick city and county.  We need to build on that.  We have never seen in the Oireachtas diversification like we have now beginning at local authority level.  I would welcome a start to that.<\/p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the State is being racist in not dealing with the almost 25,000 undocumented migrants living and contributing to our society and our economy.  These are people who have come in and have been visa overstayers for whatever reasons, but they are now here, they are embedded, they are integrated, they are working and they want to contribute to society, and we have to deal with that reality.  We campaigned for the undocumented Irish in the United States and we are hypocritical as a State for not dealing with the undocumented here.<\/p>  <p>  Social media have a huge role to play in advancing racism, regrettably.  I have had numerous occasions to contact Facebook and other providers and they are simply not equipped or not prepared to deal with the prevalence and the spread of racism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700006#D00200","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1592384100,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We have all, I hope, been shocked and deeply saddened and angered by the injustices we have seen coming out of the US.  It is easy to talk about the evils of racism as being over there, all the way over in America, but here in Ireland we need to search our own hearts.  Prejudice is deeply rooted in all of us.  It is fed by background, popular culture and, in Ireland, a sometimes clannish mistrust of people from other cultures.  It is all borne out of a complex sense of inferiority because, as a colonised country and as migrants, we were once sinned against.  However, as our President, Michael D. Higgins, once said, we have also been sinners.<\/p> <p>As a nation we need to look at the places where these attitudes are formed.  I could give examples but we all know them.  The terrible truth is that racism exists in Ireland.  It needs to be called out and stamped out.  I was shocked when a constituent showed me one EU study which found that 13% of black people have experienced racism in Ireland.  This compares with the EU average of only 5%.  As a country we desperately need to examine our conscience.  Countless studies show that multicultural societies are enriched societies.  I praise community groups like Clonakilty Friends of Asylum Seekers.  They have done Trojan work in supporting direct provision residents and helping them to feel part of the community as well as helping locals to inform and educate themselves on their backgrounds.  I also praise the incoming hate speech legislation and the potential incoming Government's pledge to once and for all end direct provision.  We need a closer look at our institutions as well.  Our social and political institutions need to ask themselves whether they are fully representative of modern Ireland.  Deputies need only take a look around this room.  It is plain to see we are not fully representative of modern Ireland and her ethnicities.  That needs to change if we are serious about driving out the prejudice that fuels racism.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700006#D00300","speaker":"1545","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592384400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I am sharing time, with three minutes for Deputy &Oacute; Broin and five minutes for Deputy Andrews.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to acknowledge the work that has been done but I believe we in this country have a long distance to go.  This is true of many parts of the world, but of Ireland in particular.  The Black Lives Matter movement has grown up in recent years and has become prevalent since the death unfortunately, under the knee of a policeman, of Mr. Floyd in the United States.  It has brought everything of this nature very much into focus.  I have heard some people react by saying that all lives matter and not only black lives.  That is true but the movement has grown up out of a particular situation in the United States, where there is an atmosphere between African-Americans and the police service that is toxic.  We want to ensure that does not happen anywhere else in the world.  That is the context in which the movement has grown up.<\/p>  <p>  We have heard the battle cry for people to come together.  It has forced people in many parts of the world to look into their own history and past.  For example, Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned the Congo and the situation in Belgium.  We need to look into our present to determine the situation.  I spoke to a schoolteacher some months ago.  She told me of a primary school in a small town in the west of Ireland and how two children came into the classroom.  They were obviously not Irish.  They were of African extraction.  Within a couple of weeks there were reports of them being bullied by the other children.  When the teacher looked into it, it transpired what the other children were hearing at home was coming into the classroom.  We need to look at all of that.  We need to examine where we are going as a society.  We need to put in the work to ensure that we change everything in that respect.  The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination report in 2019 made a range of recommendations.  I acknowledge the formation of the committee referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, some minutes ago.  This effected one of those recommendations.  Yet, many others need to be implemented with haste in the context of where we are now.<\/p>  <p>  A range of factors come into it when we look at what develops racism.  People hold an attitude towards, and fear of, something happening from abroad and of people coming in from abroad.  They believe this will have an impact on our economy and social welfare system.  All of these fallacies make up one aspect of it.  There is also an aspect whereby people fear an erosion of culture.  This is nativism.  The thinking is that the Irish are the best and anyone else or any new people coming in would somehow dilute that.  That is another fallacy and it needs to be addressed.  Another factor that has a serious impact on this is shocks in our economy.  When a shock comes to our economy, people fear that there will be fewer jobs and opportunities.  They see people coming from other places or people of difference as a threat to their security or status in society.  Those things need to be examined closely.<\/p>  <p>  The issue we need to come to the core of is attitude formation and how it happens.  Most people have a different view or perspective on life.  It comes from either their experience or whatever information they dwell in and where they get their information from.<\/p> <p>The vast majority of Irish people do not have much experience of people from other countries.  As such, it is not from their own experience that they get this.  They get it from informational fallacies.  People have mentioned social media.  Social media is one of the key problems in Ireland because people with extreme views who would never meet anyone else with the same extreme views are sharing them on social media.  They find one another and put forward these ridiculous arguments about all sorts of situations.  This is not just happening in Ireland - it has become a global phenomenon.  Unfortunately, some of the political changes that we have seen in parts of Europe, the US and elsewhere are evidence of that.<\/p> <p> We need to reach a point where we can examine where to go in this regard.  This year has been unique and there will be many historical turning points in it.  In the new decade before us, we need to consider how to have a new age of reason where everything is examined through clear analysis and reasoned debate and then work out how and why people form such negative and dangerous opinions and how to erode those.  It is all well and fine to shout \"racist\" at someone and accuse people of being racists, but we need to get under that and determine how they formed their opinions and how to erode them as we move into the future.<\/p> <p> Before I hand over to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I will say that although it is certainly for the Government to lead on this, the real effort is not just the Government's to make.  Rather, it is for every aspect of our society.  We all must work together to ensure we erode racism everywhere in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700007#E00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592385000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>As other Members have said, racism exists in Ireland, but it is important to state that it is not a new problem.  I remember as a teenager watching an English television drama set on a building site in London.  At the height of an argument between an old Irish navvy and young black British brickie, the Irish lad said without a trace of irony to the British lad, \"Why don't you go back to where you came from?\".  That one sentence encapsulates the very heart of racism - the idea that someone does not belong, is not from here and, therefore, should be treated differently.<\/p>  <p>  For this reason, I believe that the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Act 2004 - the idea that, despite being born in Ireland, people do not belong here in the same way we do because of who their parents are - was racist.  It is why I believe that opposition to Traveller accommodation, including the sale of public land to prevent such accommodation being provided, is telling those families that they do not belong and is ultimately racist.  It is why I believe that the segregation of asylum applicants into wholly inappropriate direct provision is racist.  It is why the significant number of physical and verbal attacks on people of colour are racist and why anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are racist.<\/p>  <p>  It is time to stop asking whether we have a problem with racism and start saying it is time to do much more to combat it.  This week, the Irish Network Against Racism published a useful online resource, entitled \"10 Things You Can Do About Racism in Ireland\".  I recommend that every Deputy and all people concerned about the problem read it and do something.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, words are not enough and action at all levels, especially Government, is what matters.

While prejudice, discrimination and antagonism are evidently indisputable in the US, the Irish are not as innocent as we make ourselves out to be.  In recent months, I have been disappointed to hear people saying that racism does not exist in Ireland.  Have they forgotten about the thousands of people who are living in direct provision and are marginalised in those centres?  Have they forgotten those who are forced to share rooms with people who are usually strangers?  This was even before we add concerns about Covid-19 to the equation.  Have they forgotten that asylum seekers are refused jobs and spend years in centres only to be deported?  Have they forgotten that some people who are born and raised in Ireland are not granted automatic citizenship due to racist beliefs and fears?<\/p> <p>Have they forgotten about the thousands of black citizens who are told to go back to their own countries every day?  These are only a few examples.<\/p> <p> My point is that injustice, inequality and racism are prevalent in Ireland.  I encourage everybody to continue to support this fight for justice.  We must continue to educate ourselves, campaign, donate, sign petitions and get involved in politics and advocacy long after the hashtag ends.  This is not just a trend on Twitter or Instagram, it is real life and it is the difference between life and death for many, as we have seen.  If we have to start somewhere, why should it not be in our own country?  Let us abolish direct provision.  What is outlined in this regard in the programme for Government is a positive step forward.  It is really important that we monitor progress on that commitment.  The direct provision centres deny asylum seekers basic human rights while, at the same time, isolating them from the rest of the community.  It is wrong to preach about racism and injustice in Ireland when, in practice, we are doing very little to change it.  We must stand in solidarity with those who are being discriminated against and we must fight institutional racism together.  It is not enough to be not racist; we must be anti-racist and we must act now to end direct provision.  There is no strength without unity.  Those words give me hope because they were written and sent to me by my daughter recently.  Young people really give me hope for the future and a belief that we will defeat racism.<\/p> <p> When we acknowledge that we want our citizens to be anti-racist, it is, of course, understandable.  It is something that we must strive for.  However, in the international arena, Ireland is not anti-racist.  We are not anti-racist when we refuse to stand up to the racist state that is Israel.

Not including Senator Frances Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 in the programme for Government is a huge setback and a kick in the teeth for Palestinians and all those who campaigned in respect of that legislation.  This was an opportunity to stand up to state racism but, instead, we threw the Palestinians to the wolves.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I welcome the commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination based on socio-economically disadvantaged status under the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts.  However, it seems vague and not very definitive.  I mention this because, increasingly, there is an intersection between class and race.  Many people of colour are facing race and class discrimination and I would welcome legislation on this issue as a priority.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle and appreciate the indulgence of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700009#G00700","speaker":"1555"},{"type":"speech","time":1592385600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I welcome this discussion.

I had a look around earlier but did not spot Deputy Catherine Murphy sitting right behind me.  As we go forward, we should have a committee session on this where we can hear people talk directly about their experiences.<\/p>  <p>  I want to address a couple of points.  Racism is not exceptional.  When we start talking about racists as individuals, we lose the ability to see how imbued racism is in every aspect of our society.  I prefer to talk about racism because it is everywhere.  If we are fully honest with each other, we will acknowledge that we all have used it at some stage in our life.  I have used it, I am ashamed to say, and I think every one of us has done so.  There certainly are some people in this D&aacute;il - not here today, from what I can tell - who have used it to get into this House.  That needs to be called out.  Only a couple of weeks ago, a Deputy used it in a parliamentary question in order to get attention.  That needs to be called out.  Whatever way this House is configured in the weeks ahead, I will continue to call it out if I see it in my colleagues or in people across the aisle.<\/p> <p>There are good policies coming on board and there are many goods plans.  This House has huge capacity and influence in regard to this problem, not so much in terms of influencing policies, which are important, but in terms of how we all speak in public.  There are 158 Deputies from across the country.  We are leaders in our communities.  People look up to us in our communities.  They listen to what we say.  We need to be conscious of how we talk about issues in public.  When we knock on doors and racism appears to us we need to challenge it and put a check on it.  When a new accommodation centre for asylum seekers is to be located in our area we need to be conscious of our language, how we dealt with that and how we deal with constituents who might have an issue with it.  Similarly with accommodation for Travellers, we all can say nice things but when push comes to shove, there are Members of this House who also have opposed accommodation for Travellers in their areas.  When there have been articles in the newspapers about an individual who committed a crime who is not white and Irish people have piled on and used racism.  We have all used racism and we need to call it out.<br\/><br\/>I will use the remainder of my time reading into the record statements from people who have experienced racism.  The first statement is from Eimear O'Neill:<\/p><blockquote>\tMy mum told me when I was about five or six that she watched me try to scrub the brown from my skin and cry because it wouldn't come off.  Years later I have to endure hearing my five year old telling me that he wished that he had skin like his dad and that he wants to be white like everyone else.  That just kills me.  As much as I try to lift him up and try to help him feel black and proud, his peers, the media, day-to-day life, have more influence than anything.  There is no reason why a child should feel badly about their skin colour and that's something that comes from the top down through parents, family and friends.  Racism is a taught thing.   <\/blockquote> <p>The following statement is from 25 year old Shan English Adams who is Jamaican-Irish:<\/p><blockquote>\tAs I progressed on to secondary school that's when I found that I really really got the brunt of racial abuse.  There were guys on my bus and they used to basically jeer me because my nose was too big, my forehead was too big, that I was too black or I don't belong here in Ireland, to go back to my home country.  I used to sit there sometimes and think but this is my home country; you guys are my people so where do I actually belong. <\/blockquote> <p>The following statement is from 19 year old Worelsi who is Nigerian-Irish and studying nursing in UCD:<\/p><blockquote>\tGrowing up in Ireland for me was very difficult and hard to be honest because unlike a lot of people I grew up in direct provision and that is something that I find so hard to talk about.  I remember getting bullied at one point.  It was a group of boys that would say, &quot;if you don't do this I'm going to call the police on you and you're going to get deported.&quot;  Between eight to ten years old in primary school and like your biggest fear is being deported.  I didn't realise how bad racism was until I started working in hospitals. Trying to learn and just being in the learning environment and experiencing racism from patients and some nurses was horrible and very disheartening as a student because this is a career path that you are trying to go through and it is already challenging as it is. <\/blockquote> <p>The following statement is from Lavine and it is contracted.  I cannot get it all in unfortunately today:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn secondary school, that's when verbal and a bit of physical abuse were manifested towards me.  Certain parents didn't want their kids to be friends with an N word child.  I remember being told that I was here stealing your houses, your social welfare money and to go back to my country.  In class sometimes they would bully me purely because I am black and exclude me from games in break time.  I found myself either alone or with people of my own colour. <\/blockquote> <p>This very line of abuse in regard to people coming here and using our resources was used in this House a couple of weeks ago by a Deputy in a parliamentary question. <br\/><br\/>The following is an extract from a statement from a person who works in Leinster House:<\/p><blockquote>\tDealing with the authorities can be daunting.  The moment your surname is mentioned your passport is checked for its authenticity, your application appears to take longer than the normal processing time, the person interviewing you has your surname circled during the interview and it knocks you right off course.  When they call your name over the intercom making it sound more alien than it is, you find yourself slightly embarrassed by your name as onlookers watch you take your place in line.  The strong foundations that my parents and grandparents gave me could never have prepared me for the harsh reality of racism in our society, where you experience verbal and behaviourial indignities just because of who you are as a person and what makes you you. <\/blockquote>  <p>The statement continued:<\/p><blockquote>\tLiving in a world where you are targeted with daily microagressions and derogatory remarks, one can argue that it made me resilient, but it has left scars.  Racism affects your mental health.  You want to be able to share your life with those around you but you have found that society is not ready for it so you are prepared for the unexpected.  It sees you as different, as though it is a bad thing.  As I walk the halls of Leinster House, I am conscious of my difference and I know that difference is a strength and not a weakness but I will continue to face the harsh reality of racism in our society but I hope these very halls that hold the power of change  will lead to a brighter future for many in Ireland where racism through public policy is addressed. <\/blockquote> <p>I will read one last statement:<\/p><blockquote>\tWhen I tell people about racism I am being told to relax, to not be serious, to learn how to take a joke, to stop being so radical, to ignore it, to get over it.  It is people who never experience it who are the first to tell me how to feel about racism, yet my feeling about racism is not a matter of choice.  Racism is a powerful force that is destroying my dignity, my mental well-being, my sense of belonging and my self-worth.  I know that it is difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it that even a seemingly trivial experience can have a long-lasting effect on a person at the receiving end.  Let me tell you two stories that may help you to understand.  Some years ago I was robbed on a street at knife point.  As you can imagine, this experience left me in a state of shock.  For weeks after that experience I was feeling very insecure and I had flashbacks every time someone was walking behind me.  After a couple of months, though, that feeling started to wear off, my sense of security slowly came back and within less than a year I was again walking on the streets with no fear.  Then two and a half years ago I was refused a service in a shop under a false pretence that there was no change in the till and that the card machine did not work.  As I was walking out I observed the next Irish customer being served, he being paid in cash and was given change.  The experience lives with me until today, and today, two and a half years later, I am not able to cross the entrance to that shop.  I still feel that humiliation, sense of injustice and hurt.  I was reduced to feeling like nobody and less than human.  I did not do anything about this.  I knew that not much more could be done.  I could complain to the shop management but I did not want to go through the next experience of disempowerment and injustice.  I was in this situation so many times before so I knew too well that my experience would not be taken seriously and the feeling of hurt would only be deepened.  On previous occasions I heard some made up excuses.  I had my experience diminished and undermined and I was told to ignore and get over it.  So this time I decided to do nothing, for nothing could be done so I chose to protect my dignity from further hurt.<br \/><br \/>I hope that these two stories would help you to understand the difference between a victimhood based on racism and victimhood in general.  In the first example I was targeted randomly for financial gain even though I could potentially be physically hurt I knew that who I was did not play any role, therefore the experience did not cut deep into my soul and did not leave scars.  In the second story I was physically safe yet the scars will never heal.  I was targeted because of who I am and I was made ashamed of my identity.  I was made unwelcome in a country that is home to me.  What made the situation worse was to know that my experience did not matter.  There is nowhere that I could go complain, to be taken seriously, to at least receive a listening ear and an expression of solidarity.  Racism is not a joke.  It is not something that can be ignored and once experienced it can never be forgotten.  I am not expecting miracles.  I know that we have a long way ahead of us.  However, the first step is to acknowledge that racism exists in Ireland and acknowledge the destroying powers of racism on individuals and communities.  I want my experiences to be taken seriously and I want to feel that there is a way to see justice for victims of racism. <\/blockquote> ","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700009#G01000","speaker":"1563","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592386800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>In Ireland we are in a unique position, in between Brexit and Trump, to give a different view to the world of the nature of discrimination and of our own experience because of our own history.  We are the people of Famine ships, who have gone to every corner of world.  We understand the immigrant experience like no other.  That is why it is deeply disappointing when people in this House use racism, fear and language to punch down.  Racism is about power.  It is sometimes about trying to isolate a group that one feels is not powerful, because one can, and therefore to give power to oneself.<\/p> <p> We have Deputies in this House who have said that asylum seekers are freeloaders, blackguards and hoodlums, that asylum seekers need to be deprogrammed and that asylum seekers are here to sponge off the system.  We have two members of a governing party who have been on the wrong side of anti-Traveller literature controversies, one of whom sits at Cabinet.  A number of years ago a Fine Gael councillor said in a public statement that he would not deal with black Africans.  He lost the Whip for 18 months.  We need to call out the hypocrisy of standing in a Parliament like this full of white people and saying that racism is something other people do because it is what politicians in Ireland do.  The reaction to racism among public representatives is often that he or she was not speaking for the party, and then we move on.  <\/p> <p> There is a sense that statements, such as anti-Traveller rhetoric, are not racism but are instead something different.  I first ran for election in the local elections in 2004, which coincided with the 2004 citizenship referendum proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il and supported by Fine Gael.  It was a deliberate attempt, in my mind, to punch down at or amplify a suspicion that one cannot trust an asylum seeker because there were suggestions that heavily pregnant asylum seekers were in Ireland purely to get citizenship for their children.  Can one imagine holding a constitutional referendum on that matter on the same day as a local election?  One can only imagine the type of poison that unleased.<\/p> <p> Let us please not stand in this auditorium, Parliament and Assembly and say that racism is what other people in Irish society do and that we have no part in it because we do.  I do not think people and political parties in this Parliament should be going to fundraisers in America and taking money from racist Trump supporters.  I do not think that is good enough.  We have to call out Irish America on its support for the current President of the United States.  We have to call out Irish communities in Britain who are anti-immigrant, something which is so hypocritical that it is astounding.  If we do not take that stand, who will?  How can we go to the United States on St. Patrick's Day, hand over bowls of shamrock and advocate for the undocumented Irish in America, and not do the very same for the 26,000 undocumented workers here?  They are vulnerable, poorly paid and are in vulnerable work.  <\/p> <p> Daniel O'Connell once said about the Irish slave owner, \"How can the generous, the charitable, the humane, and the noble emotions of the Irish heart have become extinct amongst you?\"  It is important, then, for the current generation of Irish leaders to speak to the hearts and experience of Irish-American, Anglo-Irish or Irish-Australian politicians all over the world who engage in racist, xenophobic and anti-immigrant sentiment about the history of the coffin ships, discrimination, being on the lowest run and being punched down.  <\/p> <p> What can we do?  I mentioned that we need to work on the regularisation of undocumented migrants.  We need to pass the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018, not just for Traveller children but for all Irish children.  We need to legislate for citizenship for children born here.  We do not need another referendum to overturn what happened in 2004. <\/p> <p>The 2004 amendment enabled this Assembly to pass whatever legislation it wished to.  We need to change that.  We need to ensure we have citizenship rights for every child who is born here.  We need to extend the right to work for asylum seekers by removing the erroneous barriers that exist to their working here.  We need to legislate against hate speech.  The Minister spoke about the 1989 Act, which has been proven to be effectively useless.  Many agencies and groups have unsuccessfully tried over a number of years to get better and more robust hate-speech and hate-crime legislation.  Now is the time to do it.<\/p> <p> I have spoken previously about the importance of having the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the teaching profession, the Garda and other public service professions reflect the population they serve.  It is not good enough to say it is an aspiration.  It is important for us to actually do something about it.  For an Irish Nigerian child, an Irish Polish child or an Irish Traveller child, how powerful would it be to have somebody in their classroom teaching them who looks just like them?  For people who are white and particularly who are male, the world is run by people who look just like them and the television is full of people who look just like them.  For those who are not it can be a very cold place and it can feel as if they do not fit in.  We have had a bad history of this with people with particular accents, people from particular addresses and obviously people from the Traveller community.<\/p> <p> Now is the opportunity to make our public broadcaster, the teaching profession, the Garda and this Assembly more reflective of the population.  With 11 appointments due to be made to the Seanad in a number of weeks, there is no reason not to put the fine words of the Minister's speech into action and actually appoint to the Seanad - to these Houses of the Oireachtas - somebody from these minority communities, rather than a party political hack, which is inevitably what will happen.  How powerful would it be to have somebody from the black community or the Traveller community in Ireland sitting in the Seanad because the Taoiseach has made it a priority?  Alternatively, will we just go back to the way we were?  Running for election and getting elected is important and if punching down on asylum seekers, immigrants or Travellers is what gets someone elected, that is just the way the system works.<\/p> <p> As has been said, all of us have our prejudices.  Anybody who stands up here and says they do not have prejudices is telling lies because we all have.  We all grew up in this country and we all know about the sectarianism, the anti-Traveller sentiment and the prejudices that are all around us.  We all feel them, and we often let ourselves down by using them.  Certainly, the political system could do much more than just the words that are spoken here today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700011#J00200","speaker":"1551","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592387700,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The heading for today's debate is combatting racism and supporting inclusion, two issues one would have hoped would be a no-brainer in 2020 Ireland.  However, even thinking such issues should not be a thing shows a privilege that all of us must not face, however uncomfortable that may be as we listen to the real-life lived experiences of black people and people of colour in Ireland.  Last week the legend that is Paul McGrath tweeted: \"Honestly I think Racism exists everywhere.  But being Irish means we should know a little of how it feels to be perceived as less than, even when in our hearts we knew we are all Equals.\"  While it is true that the Irish have known our fair share of oppression, the reality is that during that oppression we still maintained our invisibility cloak of white privilege.<\/p>  <p>  Of course, we know that there are many forms of discrimination, including socioeconomic, gender-based, anti-Traveller bias and generally anything that makes up a minority group will likely become a target of discrimination.<\/p> <p>The fact is that race discrimination in Ireland has been, and continues to be, a significant issue and one that causes serious anguish to so many of our fellow citizens.<\/p> <p> The spotlight at the moment is very rightly focused on racism because of the global actions arising following the murder of George Floyd.  The focus, however, is not at the expense of recognising all other forms of discrimination.  Shockingly, we can fight many different battles simultaneously and care about them all equally.  Right now, one house is burning more rapidly than others and so requires our immediate attention.  That should not be an issue for anyone who understands empathy and solidarity.  We have thankfully seen a massive outpouring of support and solidarity across the world and across Ireland.  While many have spent some days posting various issues on the hashtag Black Lives Matter, along with information pieces and black squares to their social media feeds, we must be conscious that when this visceral moment passes, the conversations and resulting necessary changes must not be brushed aside.  There must be action to follow this.<\/p> <p> While some negative things, rightly and understandably, are being said about social media, one of the most positive social media initiatives, among many, to emerge from the current situation has been the creation of an Instagram account called Black and Irish.  On that page, black people from a variety of backgrounds in Ireland share experiences of both subtle and covert racism they have lived with here.  The tales told are beautifully balanced by the details of the exciting and vibrant lives of the people telling their stories and the way in which they are contributing to Irish society.  I could go on all day about this if I was to reference all the beautiful stories, and it is well worth taking a look at it.  One could maybe read Rebekah who is half-Irish and half-Ethiopian and about to finish her master's degree in clinical psychology, or read of Samuel from Lagos and now Dublin who is a successful model, or Katja originally from Burundi who focuses on empowering young women.  Each of their stories, and the myriad others on the page, tell of heartache and discrimination but all are hopeful of an Ireland that is improving and which is increasingly diverse and accepting.  We must build on that.  This improvement will only happen where specific actions and strategies are employed to ensure proper and cohesive integration and diversification.  That means everything from schools admission policies to national housing policy to targeted funding for sports or other specific measures to increase participation of minorities.  I look forward to next year when we see the various competitions in sport, which is one area where we see greater diversity.  More needs to be done however.  Equally, while it is refreshing to watch major media organisations here at home giving a proper focus to Black Lives Matter and to the experiences of black people and people of colour in Ireland, what we need to see as the current furore recedes from front pages across the world, is for actual action to flow from the current, but very welcome, lip-service.  This includes seeing far more diversity on our television screens and in newsrooms with journalists, reporters and presenters who are not exclusively white.  It means this Chamber and our Seanad Chamber having black people and people of colour in a representative capacity.  There are two women here in the Chamber at the moment and it is very difficult, as a woman, not to notice the imbalance.  Can one imagine what it feels like for people of colour to look in here and not feel represented.  Ultimately it means that all of us must sit uncomfortably with ourselves and accept that true integration means challenging ourselves, sharing the microphone, sharing the spaces, and sharing our society equally.  To do anything different is, quite bluntly, to perpetuate racism.<\/p>  <p>Although it is very welcome that there is a commitment in the programme for Government to phasing out direct provision within the lifetime of the incoming Government, that does not mean we should not do things now or call things out.<\/p> <p> Several issues have come to the fore in recent weeks.  I do not think we have satisfactorily dealt with the matter relating to Cahirsiveen and how it played out.  That will be inquired into, and rightly so.  People are still living in conditions that I regard as substandard.  The benchmark we should use is to ask whether the accommodation in question is good enough for us or our children to live in.  A report has been compiled on the situation in Milltown Malbay.  Following its publication, I, and probably many other Deputies, received correspondence detailing that the ceilings are leaking, water is running through light fittings, there is no door on an en suite facility where there are non-familial shared arrangements, there is no privacy for occupants and rodents have been spotted in bedrooms.  There is a lack of heating or hot water, with water only available for one hour per day.  There a curfew on adults and the food is substandard.  I continue to have serious concerns about that situation.  When that plays out in the public arena, it sends a big signal in the context of how official Ireland treats people.  We must return to that issue.  I am not satisfied with how it has played out.<\/p> <p> I echo much of what has been stated regarding the Traveller community.  I remember a couple of girls coming to my office and talking about their hopes for the future.  One of them stated that she knows that when she goes into a premises to hand in her curriculum vitae, it will be in the bin before she is out the door.  I could not argue with her because the progression that Travellers hoped for has not happened.  When one ostracises and excludes people, one will draw a reaction.  There must be a significant programme of intervention and an acceptance that there has been appalling discrimination in respect of the Traveller community.  The House will probably discuss the awful case reported in the media in recent days when it deals with domestic violence next week.  There must be a follow-through on the experience of those women and the courage it took for them to go public about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700013#L00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592388300,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputy Barry.  We must not just condemn racism, we must also fight against it.  That is why People Before Profit declares absolute solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and the wave of protest across the world in the aftermath of the horrific killing of George Floyd.  There has been a rightful recognition by a vast number of people worldwide that it was not an isolated incident but, rather, a deadly and brutal consequence of systemic and widespread racism across America and the rest of the world.  Anyone who spends time on social media will know that those putting forward that view will very quickly receive a torrent of abuse asking why one is going on about the Black Lives Matter movement and what is happening in America.  One is asked what it has to do with us and told that surely all lives matter.  Of course, what that sentiment fails to recognise, sometimes deliberately, is that it is precisely because all lives matter that we must declare solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.  The death of George Floyd could only happen in a society in which some people believe that the lives of black people and other people of colour do not matter.<\/p> <p>They believe that they are somehow lesser, that they are dehumanised and, therefore, it is acceptable to treat them as less than human.  That is the essence of racism, a system perpetuated by the likes of Donald Trump, who deliberately and cynically uses it to try to deflect away from his own failings on so many levels to turn people against one another by dehumanising black people and people of colour. <\/p> <p> As has been said, if Trump is the most visible and blunt exponent of racism among leaders in the world today, it is not something that is alien to this country.  Speakers have already mentioned the 27th amendment of the Constitution, which denies equality and citizenship to some children born in this country.  There is the anti-Traveller racism, which is the shame of this State and which can very possibly be seen in the horrific consequences for the eight victims of James O'Reilly, who suffered the most terrible abuse.  The allegation that is made, and that seems very credible, is that their ethnic origin as Travellers led to a poor response by the State in dealing with the horrific abuse they suffered.  It is also seen in the fact that in the aftermath of the crash of 2008, the Traveller accommodation programme was cut from &euro;70 million a year to &euro;4 million in 2015 and, somehow, this was deemed acceptable; that 13% of female Travellers finish school as distinct from 70% of settled females; and that Travellers are six times more likely to die from suicide than people from the settled community.  Of course, there is the horrific system of direct provision, which segregates asylum seekers and refugees in inhumane and degrading conditions that no person would accept for his or her own family or loved ones but which we seem to think are okay to inflict on people, mostly people of colour, who come to this country looking for refuge.<\/p> <p> To those who say we should not raise these issues or that, somehow, it is not the business of the Irish people to worry about these things, I would say that that sentiment is a betrayal of the Irish revolutionary and radical tradition, which has always understood the need to stand with the oppressed and exploited, wherever they are across the world.  I think particularly of Damien Dempsey's song, \"Choctaw Nation\", where he reminds people that the Choctaw nation of Native Americans, who suffered at the hands of slavers and frontiersmen, often Irishmen, rather than respond by saying, &ldquo;We do not care about the plight of the Irish&rdquo;, when the Irish were suffering famine conditions in the 1840s, instead sent money, aid and solidarity to Famine victims here in Ireland.  That sort of internationalism, that sort of solidarity, standing with the oppressed, standing against racism, is actually the duty and responsibility of people across the world, but very particularly people in this country, given our history.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700015#N00200","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592388600,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I want to start by talking about State racism.  Now 20 years old, the direct provision system is cruel and heartless.  It deliberately puts asylum seekers into miserable living conditions to discourage others from travelling to here from outside fortress Europe, and it deliberately separates asylum seekers from the rest of Irish society, the better to make it easy to deport people whose applications do not succeed.  It is the major example in this country of State racism.<\/p>  <p>  We have had reports in recent days of plans to end direct provision, and provisions are included in the programme for Government.  However, to me, it looks suspiciously like a rebranding of direct provision and I want to ask some questions about that.  First, the programme for Government states that direct provision will be ended within the lifetime of this Government.  This Government potentially could last for five years.  I can say very clearly to Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Greens that the people who marched with Black Lives Matter and the asylum seekers who protested in the centres are not prepared to wait five years for the dismantling of this system.<\/p> <p>The programme for Government states the accommodation will now be centred on a not-for-profit approach.  The removal of the profiteers is welcome.  It is as a result of the pressure that has come from below.  However, it is not acceptable to switch from private direct provision centres to publicly owned direct provision centres, in other words, direct provision centres that still provide institutional accommodation to asylum seekers and deny asylum seekers the right to seek housing and accommodation themselves within society with all of the other rights, including housing assistance payment, that other people living in this country have, and including the right to work.  Is institutional accommodation going to be abolished or is it not?  It seems to me it is not.  If someone can tell me otherwise I would like to hear it.  It is an important debate.<\/p> <p> The programme for Government speaks about speeding up applications for asylum.  If an application is accepted a person has the right to stay but if it is rejected what happens?  Often times people and their families end up being deported.  Deportation is a brutal policy.  People are taken into custody and put on flights and kicked out of the country against their will.  Will the speeding up of applications mean the speeding up of deportations?  We saw almost 600 deportations in 2017, 2018 and 2019.<\/p> <p> What the people who have spoken out against direct provision and who have marched want is the speedy dismantling of this system.  They want the right for asylum seekers to live in the community with the same rights as others in our society and an end to the racist policy of deportation.  I challenge Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party to contradict me if I am wrong but it looks to me as though what is being proposed is that this could take a number of years, that institutional accommodation is not to be abolished and that they will continue with the policy of deportation, including quicker deportations.<\/p> <p> Citizenship rights were taken away from people outside the EU who were born here after 2004 in a racist referendum.  Some of those young people have since been deported.  Now that they are in the teenage years they face discrimination in schools, work and study as a result of this.  Solidarity and People Before Profit Deputies brought a Bill before the last D&aacute;il stating citizenship rights should be restored.  I will resubmit the Bill and add to it a provision that young people who grow up in this country should also have the right to citizenship where it is denied to them at present.  I had wanted to go on and make important points about anti-Travellers racism in this society but the clock is against me.  This is an issue I will certainly return to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700016#O00200","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592388900,"counter":41,"content":"<p>In recent days we have all received hundreds of emails from people throughout the country regarding the Black Lives Matter campaign, a civil rights campaign that has its origins in the slave trade from Africa to North America.  Not one of these emails references human trafficking, which is the third most lucrative illicit business in the world after arms and drug trafficking.  Human trafficking, or modern-day slave trading, is a hidden crime.  Its victims cannot or dare not make themselves known to the authorities for fear of retaliation or because they are illegal emigrants.  A common feature of many victims of trafficking is that their home countries are poor and there are few opportunities for employment.  The groups most vulnerable to this crime are those of low status without powerful protectors, typically women and children, especially orphans or those subjected to domestic violence, in addition to impoverished men and those in debt bondage.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the trafficked adults are deceived about the type of work they will be doing and may be charged extortionate fees by agencies for arranging work.  When they arrive they are tricked or intimidated into surrendering their travel documents and either forced into prostitution or subjected to forced labour.  The types of legitimate work that women think they are being recruited to do include jobs in the restaurant trade, domestic work or childminding.  They may also be promised education and training opportunities.  Some women know they may have to work in the sex industry for a while but they have no idea of the violence and degradation to which they will be subjected.  Many children or their families think they are opting for a better life with better education and employment opportunities, sometimes with a private foster family.  Many of the victims are held in what is an invisible prison.  They are in a foreign country with no language skills and are vulnerable as a result.  The same mechanisms have been used in domestic violence down through the generations in this country and elsewhere.  Such victims are often raped to test them out initially.  In some cases, they are offered to the traffickers' friends to cultivate them into the trade of prostitution.<\/p>  <p>  In 2007, I was appalled to be told that children had disappeared from State care and had been trafficked into the sex industry here and the UK, and into labour exploitation mainly in the UK.  I questioned why we had not heard about this scandal before and I was told it was because these children came from Africa and Asia and nobody cared.  Nobody even knew how many children had gone missing and did not really care either.  They had no mother or father living here in Ireland.  They were not from here.  As far as official statistics were concerned they never existed.  That was institutional and societal racism.<\/p>  <p>  Things were not made easy for me in getting answers and exposing the fact that during the noughties, the most prosperous decade we have seen in Ireland, 443 children went missing from State care and were never found.  It was going on unnoticed around us.  At least some of these 443 children who were unaccounted for had been forced into the exploitation industry, prostitution or slave labour.  What was the response of official Ireland?  As an example, in February 2010 a spokesperson for the HSE stated it was unsubstantiated that any of the children who went missing from HSE care had been trafficked but the previous July garda&iacute; had raided three restaurants, including a very popular high-end restaurant, after receiving intelligence that 34 missing children had been in contact with this particular businessman.  A subsequent media report on the case in the following June ran a headline stating that missing minors had been traced to a Chinese restaurateur.  The article went on to state that garda&iacute; were to recommend that a wealthy Chinese restaurateur be charged with the trafficking of several Chinese children who had disappeared from State care at accommodation hostels for unaccompanied boys and girls in the preceding years.<\/p>  <p>  It was not just that the HSE, which had legal responsibility for the welfare of these children, was failing them.  It was also questioning my credibility in highlighting this particular scandal.  Unofficial and off the record briefings to the media by official Ireland were to move on and that there was no story.  On top of this, the abuse my staff and I put up with when raising this issue was absolutely horrendous.  People did not want to have the situation addressed.  The attitude was that these children deserved what they got for coming to Ireland in the first place, including the five young Nigerian girls who vanished in June 2007, the youngest of whom was just 11 years of age.<\/p> <p>The fact was that migrant girls as young as 15 had been found by garda&iacute; in brothels throughout this country.  These figures were only the tip of the iceberg, with suspected child victims of trafficking ranging in age from as young as three to 17 years old who had been transported to Ireland from foreign countries for forced labour, begging, domestic servitude, sexual exploitation and forced marriage.<\/p> <p> At the height of the political focus on historical residential abuse in our industrial schools, that very same dereliction of care on behalf of the State was continuing to allow those who exploited and abused children of different colours and nationalities to go on undetected.  That is institutional racism.  As a Member of the Oireachtas who did not want to let this continue simply on the basis of the colour of a child's skin, my staff and I faced an avalanche of abuse every time I highlighted this injustice.<\/p> <p> That abuse paled into insignificance when I successfully turned the legal tables on prostitution for the very first time in this country, making it illegal knowingly to purchase sex from a person who had been trafficked into the country.  This was the very first time in Irish law that a person availing of the services of a prostitute was subject to criminal sanction, and it was the precursor to the subsequent legislation by the Minister at the time, Frances Fitzgerald, criminalising the purchase of sex.  The reason that I argued so strongly at the time and was able to convince the then Minister, the late Brian Lenihan, was because of the scale of migrant women in the sex industry in Ireland at that point. Up to 97% of the 1,000 women involved in indoor prostitution in Ireland at that time were migrant women.  In fact, in 2007 and 2008, a minimum of 102 women and girls were clearly identified as sex trafficked, 11 of whom were children when they arrived in Ireland.  None of these women knew they were destined for the Irish sex trade, but as far as official Ireland was concerned, they were women who had made life choices of going into such a career.<\/p> <p> It was not just official Ireland.  There was, let us say, a frosty reception by Members of this House to my success in amending that law.  The abuse that was received by my office at the time from a minority of the public was vile.  In fact, I recall we had to stop answering the phones altogether at one stage due to the abuse.  We received some very sick correspondence as well.  Yet, having had to put up with such abuse, I have been branded a racist, even by Members of this House, because I questioned the direct provision system in a particular manner, one that the public could relate to.  For me, the direct provision system is inhumane and, as I have stated in this House on many occasions, is the institutional abuse of our generation.<\/p> <p> It is far too easy for the ill-informed to throw the racist tag about when one is trying to have a constructive discussion about issues involving people from other countries and cultures.  We have to be able to question what we see as wrong in our society, whether that is children of any race going missing from State care or the scandal of the direct provision system, yet attacks from keyboard warriors, abusive phone calls, and the attitudes of colleagues can leave people afraid to question what they believe is wrong and allows institutional racism to continue unchallenged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700017#P00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592389500,"counter":43,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Naughten.

I am glad to get the opportunity to say a few words on this topic.  As we all know, there has been a lot in the media and on the television over recent weeks on the subject.  My youngsters at home pointed out to me that black lives matter.  We believe that all lives matter.  Even the small unborn babies that we fought so hard for in this Chamber also matter.  All people all around the world, whatever nationality and whatever breed or colour they are, they all matter.  We all agree with that.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad to say that here in Ireland, by and large, we are not racist.  We welcome people from all over the world and treat them the same as ourselves.  Even in Killarney we have a Bangladeshi community.  Many of them have been there for 20, 21 or 22 years.  They are Irish citizens now.  They work in the community, around the town and around the county.  They are proud to be part of our community and I am glad to say that I appreciate them, their work and the contribution they make to life in Killarney and around Kerry.<\/p>  <p>  On the refugees that we bring in to direct provision, I have been saying for years that the system is wrong.  When a whole family is in a room, and I have seen that - six beds shoved together in a room - that is not a healthy atmosphere for parents or children.  They are standing on each other's toes.  Maybe it is not exactly as bad as it was four or five years ago, but it is still very bad and very wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I am saying to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that we should only allow the number of refugees in here that we can care for properly.  We see what is happening in Cahersiveen.  I do not know if the Minister will be here the next day.  I will be here and I wish him the very best in any case, but I am appealing to him.  The hotel in Cahersiveen is not adequate.  The hallways and rooms are too small and narrow.  There is no open-air space there.  It is not fair on children that they cannot hop around and do as children would do in the open air on a fine day.  We have had a lot of fine days and they were cooped up or else they had to go down to the town.  There were problems with that when people presented with the coronavirus in the town centre.  I ask the Minister, for once and for all, to close it down.<\/p>  <p>  We have many schools around our county.  In Ballycasheen, Killarney we have maybe 40 foreign students from different countries in that school alone.  In a small school like Tahilla, at one time they had children of 13 different nationalities in that school.  That was only a couple of years ago.  I do not know how many are there now.<\/p>  <p>  What is very important, and I have to say it here today, is that I appreciate every type of religion and none.  Whatever religion people have, I appreciate that, but I do not want anyone to make little of our religion, the Catholic religion.  That has been happening, even by Members of this Chamber, in the previous D&aacute;il anyway.  I regret that, because I appreciate that other people have other views and other religions, and that is fine with me, but we must be allowed to carry on our tradition and the religion that we were brought up in, without fear or favour.  I am asking the Members of the incoming D&aacute;il to ensure that our religion gets the same treatment as every other religion and that our children of Catholic origin going into schools get the same treatment that other children are getting.  It has turned full circle.  We have to ensure that we look after our own.<\/p>  <p>  Sorry, I have gone into Deputy Collins' time.  Thank you very much, Ceann Comhairle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700018#Q00800","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1592390100,"counter":50,"content":"<p>In 1973, when Ireland joined the Common Market, every denomination and race was to be treated equally in Ireland.  I wonder if the Irish were treated in this way all over the world.  Have we now become so politically correct that we are going to knock down our statues and sculptures and erase our history?  The next thing we know our books will be burned to censor our history, culture and religion.  What is happening worldwide is chaotic.  Protesting during a pandemic is simply dangerous.  People are killing and hurting each other.  Is the world gone mad?<\/p>  <p>  Racism is simply wrong and it must never be tolerated.  As a rural politician, I have tried to make my voice heard many times on this issue, having spoken in the D&aacute;il strongly against the way people are being treated in direct provision, living in such congregated settings.  When Covid-19 hit, finally it seemed that people had started to listen to what I was saying for many years.<\/p>  <p>  When we were growing up, we were taught by our parents to respect all, whether this be our own in our own country or those who lived throughout the world.  Our churches, especially the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the Methodist Church in Ireland, raised tens of millions of pounds at the time for people in Peru and Ethiopia through Tr&oacute;caire or whatever means were required.  Almost every second Sunday in the churches in Lowertown, Goleen, Schull and Ballydehob, all the parishioners were delighted to contribute to better the lives of those who struggled abroad and no one stands up here today and thanks the churches for doing this.  All too often, people find it easier to point the finger at the churches.  There was no mention of racism when I was growing up.  People only gave as much as they could afford in order to help others.  This was done with a heart and a half and it continues today, unacknowledged.<\/p>  <p>  My proposal is simple.  Our rural communities are crying out for new families to come and live in them, in the many vacant houses that are there in towns and villages.  This is where a rural resettlement programme should have been launched and should be launched, where at least two\u202ffamilies in direct provision should be given the chance to live in every rural community in our country.  If this was to happen, it would provide a happy home for those in direct provision.  It would restart the process of rebuilding rural communities that have incredible facilities for all to enjoy and that would support inclusion and combat racism by integrating the people in direct provision into the local communities in a non-forceful manner.<\/p>  <p>  The fundamental human right to dignity is inviolable in EU law and must be upheld, irrespective of the nationality or immigration status of the person.  Let us not forget the Irish people who are homeless or living in hotel rooms with children squashed in like sardines, just like people in direct provision centres.  This too is wrong.  If the proposals we made four years ago when the programme for Government was being drawn up had been listened to, thousands of people who are in hotel rooms today could be living in rural towns and villages.  They too need to be afforded the same rights as every other race and denomination.  My mantra in life has always been that all lives matter, from the unborn baby in the womb to the man and woman on the street, black or white.  All lives matter.  Dignity, respect and a little bit of humanity would go a long way in this Covid-19 world we all find ourselves in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700019#R00100","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1592390100,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with Deputies Harkin and Connolly.  Black lives matter and that is a powerful statement.  It has made us look at ourselves, which is good.  Unfortunately, we have not come up trumps with the message of that statement.  I have experienced first-hand the racism of Irish people in my constituency office.  They might not see it as racism but there is racism in the statements they make, such as saying that people of colour get better treatment and so on.  Unfortunately, that is the sentiment that comes up and one has to challenge that every time it arises because that is the only way one can deal with it.<\/p>  <p>  I have been encouraged by the fact that the Irish people who are campaigning on Black Lives Matter are linking it to what we are doing in this State.  That makes a serious difference to how people's lives are impacted here.  The linking of it to direct provision and the use of Shannon Airport by the American war machine is encouraging.  It is a pity we could not extend it to this House as well.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we are not a tolerant society and saying we are is sadly not true and also leads to minimising the issue.  If laws were all that were needed, we would be way ahead.  Ireland would be a great country if this issue was based only on laws.  Sadly, we need more than laws to ensure we defeat racism in our society.  Racism has been present in this House and we have seen that in recent years.  It has also played a part in some Members winning a seat here, even a member of the Government.  It may not have been as blatant as some of the comments but the intention is the same, namely to make political gain out of people's differences.  We need to change the way that this House looks and we must wait for elections to sort this House out but it is within the grasp of this House to make sure the Oireachtas as a whole is representative of Ireland.  The three parties that are forming a Government can ensure the Seanad is representative of the country as a whole by appointing Travellers and Irish people of colour to the House to give a voice to those communities.<\/p>  <p>  It is not only for blacks or Travellers to provide a voice for themselves, however.  We must be representative of all the people in our community in this House as well.  The most important contribution we can make is to ensure no person suffers because of what we say or do here.  We should be intolerant of racism in all its forms here and then we can have legitimacy in challenging it in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700019#R00200","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1592390100,"counter":52,"content":"<p>All of us were horrified and appalled at the death of George Floyd.  It stopped us in our tracks and it was as if somebody gave us a kick in the stomach.  I remember that awful feeling, as I rewatched that eight minutes and 43 seconds and all I wanted to do was shout: \"Stop, please stop.\"  In a way that is what we need to do today.  We need to look inside ourselves and we need to tell ourselves to stop because while the actions of the police in the case of George Floyd were murder, plain and simple, they were just the endpoint of a scale that starts with casual racism.  That is why we need to tell ourselves to stop.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us carry prejudices that we do not even know about or recognise until we question ourselves.  Some of our ideas are formed in a vacuum in that many of us do not see black people regularly and do not interact with them every day or week.  Many people do not even interact with black people once a month.  That does not make one racist but it can make one unthinking.<\/p>  <p>  Our language is such that in so many instances, the colour white is associated with something that is good, pure or innocent, while the colour black often has a different connotation of something sinister, dark or wrong.  Whether we like it or not, our thoughts are coloured by our language.  It is difficult to look at oneself and examine those thoughts and they are often not verbally expressed but it is essential that we do so.  That is what I mean when I say we sometimes need to stop and ask questions of ourselves.<\/p>  <p>  We are not at the point of what happened in Minneapolis.  We are not even close to that but racism is not black and white.  It is a gradual move from white to grey and then to black.  Minneapolis was black and the question we have to ask ourselves is what colour we are at on that scale.  That is why the action we take now is crucial.  If we look at so many countries across the world, we can see the divide and rule principle of them and us.  It makes it so much easier for dictators to take power and add to that power by politicising the principle of them and us; the insiders and the outsiders; the good and the bad; the worthy and the unworthy; those who belong and those who are strangers; and those who are doing their best and those who are trying to take advantage.  That is the direction of travel of an increasing number of rulers.  We can call it a culture war or whatever we like but racism is at its core.  Again, we are not at that position here and we have time to stop.  I have read the programme for Government and the section on inclusion is a progressive and positive statement.  If it is implemented, we will not move along that scale.<\/p>  <p>  I want to comment briefly on two issues.  We can do more in schools.  I was a teacher and I know a lot of responsibility is placed on the shoulders of teachers.<\/p> <p>I heard my colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, speak about this earlier.  Schools are a really important place where we ensure that we can stitch anti-racism into our curriculum and ensure that racism has no place.<\/p> <p> As for the idea of integrating migrants into our community, I am pleased to see the commitment to end direct provision.  The sooner this happens, the better.  If we look to places such as Ballaghaderreen where voluntary groups and committees come together and make an effort, as neighbours, to integrate, that will stop us sliding to black on the scale to which I refer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700019#R00300","speaker":"1605","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592390700,"counter":54,"content":"<p>F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; ar an &aacute;bhar seo.

I wish we were speaking because of the submission the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission made to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in December 2019.  That would be very helpful.<\/p>  <p>  Before I come to that, we talk about racism as a disease and a cancer.  That is not helpful.  I did not say the Minister said it but I have heard it repeated many times.  Racism is not a disease or a cancer; it is deliberate unacceptable behaviour, prejudice, discrimination, violence and murder, as we have seen in America, against a particular group or one person or people because of their race or colour.  We rightly condemn what is happening in America, and the American ambassador should be called in and left under no illusion as to what we think of the behaviour of the police.<\/p>  <p>  In doing that, however, we must hold a mirror up to ourselves.  If we are doing that today, I welcome it.  We certainly need to hold that mirror up if we look at the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, an independent body, and its report.  The Minister will see that the report states: \"Several areas identified by the Committee in its 2011 Concluding Observations have not seen sufficient progress in the intervening period.\"  It points out how much Ireland has changed and how we now have more than 535,475 people, 11.6% of the population, whose nationality is other than Irish.  In Galway city, where we had an anti-racism strategy, which has since lapsed, it is almost 20% of the population, or one in five.  Then we have the undocumented, to whom reference has been made.  We have the audacity to go to America and talk about the undocumented there while ignoring 20,000 to 26,000 undocumented here.<\/p>  <p>  In the few seconds I have left, I will draw the Minister's attention to the following matter.  The commission tells us that we have failed to ratify a number of protocols and treaties and recommends that we proceed to ratify them.  It refers to the absence of data such that we cannot really see what is happening or the existence of discrimination and disadvantage.  It tells us there is extensive research demonstrating \"consistent and significant levels of discrimination against minority ethnic groups in Ireland\".  It tells us there is \"a demonstrable history of chronic racism [this is December 2019] and discrimination against Travellers in Ireland\".  Galway city has distinguished itself as one of the councils that spent nothing on Traveller accommodation.  It goes on to tell us about what Deputy Denis Naughten referred to, human trafficking.  The Minister might read it.  The commission has significant concern about human trafficking and that Ireland is both a destination and a source country for it - and this is what is interesting - including people trafficked for sexual exploitation, domestic work, fishing, agricultural work, the restaurant industry, waste management work and car washing services.  The report highlights many more things, including direct provision.  It highlights that the commission remains very seriously concerned about significant human rights issues relating to Ireland's international protection system.  It refers to the admissions policy for schools and the lack of protection for and over-policing of minority ethnic communities as a result of racial profiling.  It also highlights some of the good things and some of the initiatives taken by the Garda.<\/p>  <p>  It seems, however, that we should stop talking and should look at this report and the expertise in it.  The commission has produced its results and given the good and the bad.  We should ask what we are doing about it and what steps we need to take.  At the very least, the Minister should tell us why these protocols and the various conventions have not been ratified.  They have been highlighted, with very little progress made since 2011, although I do welcome the progress that has been made on certain issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700020#S00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1592390700,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 11.15 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An tOrd Gn\u00f3 - Order of Business","time":1592391300,"counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700021#X00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1592391300,"counter":57,"content":"<p>Our first item for consideration is the Order of Business for today and for Wednesday morning of next week.

I do not see the reason or justification for scaling back a D&aacute;il that is already significantly scaled back.  It has sat far less recently, when so many pressing issues are facing our country.  It seems that the only reason we are not having a D&aacute;il sitting tomorrow or next week is because the two major parties and their prospective coalition partners in the Green Party do not want to be scrutinised on the programme for Government document, a document which, frankly, is a deeply disappointing failure to give effect to the demands for change expressed by the electorate on 8 February.

As part of the Government's climate action plan and in accordance with the national adaptation framework in October 2019, my Department published two sectoral adaptation plans, one addressing biodiversity and the other on built and archaeological heritage.  My Department also has responsibility for implementing several mitigation measures in the climate action plan, including those relating to peatland conservation and the development of guidance for the retrofit of historic buildings.  The two sectoral adaptation plans published by my Department are part of series of five adaptation plans covering our natural and cultural capital.  My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, spoke last week about plans for seafood, agriculture and forestry.<\/p>  <p>  As we know, biodiversity is fundamental to our natural capital, the stock of natural assets required to sustain a healthy economic and social life.  Biodiversity provides us with clean air, water, food, materials, medicines and health benefits.  It supports pollination and soil fertility, regulates climate and protects us from extreme weather and other effects of climate change.  Despite the important role that biodiversity plays in underpinning our economy, health and resilience to climate change, we are losing biodiversity at a rate seen only during previous mass extinctions.  By the end of the century, climate change is likely to become the most significant driver of biodiversity loss.  Increases in temperature will change the timing of life cycle events and the distribution of species.  The physical impact of more intense storms and increased winter and spring rainfall will accelerate the degradation of habitats that are already compromised by unsustainable practices.  The conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity needs to be escalated.<\/p>  <p>  Actions within the biodiversity climate change adaptation plan are aimed at improving sustainable agriculture, including better soil and land management and, most urgently, the restoration of natural systems.  We have moved into the implementation phase of this adaptation plan and many actions are being progressed.  One of the most foundational actions to be taken will be the action to account for the economic value of biodiversity and the role it plays in sustaining our economic and social life.  This occurs through the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, and, as we are now most aware, on the risk of disease in humans.<\/p>  <p>  We are working with the research community to value ecosystem services and to develop a roadmap towards the integration of natural capital values into national accounts and reporting systems.  This will strengthen the business case to promote nature-based solutions as a climate adaptation tool for other sectors.  I welcome the inclusion of nature-based solutions as part of the local climate adaption plans.  Together, we can address the societal challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the actions my Department is taking will assist us to adapt to climate change and, through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate its effects by improving data availability and taking action on foot of that data.  My Department has partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency as part of a transnational research call to investigate the consequences of climate change on biodiversity and the potential of nature-based solutions for mitigating and adapting to climate change.  Submissions are currently being evaluated.  We will also provide technical support to the Geological Survey of Ireland, which will be monitoring and modelling groundwater levels to further understand how possible climate change scenarios might impact on a range of Irish groundwater systems.  My Department funds the National Biodiversity Data Centre, which is undertaking important work deriving climate change indicators through monitoring programmes and citizen science.<\/p>  <p>  As we are all aware, our peatlands can play a strong natural role in climate regulation.  Carbon loss from drainage and damage to peatlands can be stopped or reduced through the restoration of bogs and good hydrological management measures.  That is why our aim, as outlined in the climate action plan, is ultimately to restore over 22,000 ha of our unique raised bog habitat.  The national protected raised bog restoration programme is being accelerated this year with funding of &euro;5 million for peatlands restoration allocated from revenue raised from the increase in the carbon tax in budget 2020.  This funding will allow for restoration measures to be undertaken on over 1,800 ha of designated raised bog in 2020 on up to nine sites across seven counties in the midlands.  The 2020 programme has already commenced with the appointment of Bord na M&oacute;na, through a public procurement process, to project-manage the programme, to provide other necessary professional services and to undertake the work on the nine sites.<\/p> <p>I hope that the restoration works will commence in the coming weeks.  A specialised piece of equipment, called an eddy covariance flux tower, is also scheduled to be installed at a designated raised bog site to monitor ecosystem scale fluxes of turbulent energy, water and greenhouse gases between the bog and the atmosphere.  Twenty-three other raised bog designated sites have been identified for restoration works over the next number of years under the national protected raised bog restoration programme.<\/p> <p> We are also taking action in respect of our blanket bogs.  My Department led a recent successful bid to secure EU LIFE funding to implement concrete actions in 24 blanket bog special areas of conservation, SACs, in Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  Conservation measures will increase the resilience of these blanket bog complexes to climate change and contribute to carbon sequestration and water regulation.<\/p> <p> Our built and archaeological heritage is as irreplaceable a resource as our natural environment, not only for its intrinsic value and contribution to our individual and collective well-being, but as a cornerstone of our tourism industry, which is vital to many of our regional economies.  Our heritage is vulnerable to climate change impacts, including flooding, storm damage, coastal erosion, microbiological growth and wildfire.  It is also vulnerable to maladaptation, which is the inadvertent loss or damage to heritage structures and sites during adaptation works by others.<\/p> <p> The built and archaeological heritage sectoral adaptation plan that my Department published in October 2019 has five key goals: first, improve understanding of each heritage resource and its vulnerability to climate change impacts; second, develop and mainstream sustainable policies and plans for climate change adaptation of built and archaeological heritage; third, conserve Ireland&rsquo;s heritage for future generations; fourth, communicate and transfer knowledge; and fifth, exploit the opportunities for built and archaeological heritage to demonstrate value and secure resources.<\/p> <p> Among the tasks identified to achieve these goals are conducting risk and vulnerability assessments, undertaking monitoring of climate change impacts on heritage assets and integrating heritage issues into national and local policies.  Capacity building, disaster risk management and increasing heritage resilience will also be vital steps in implementing the plan.  Climate change issues will be fully integrated into forthcoming policies of my Department, including the national heritage plan, Heritage Ireland 2030, Places for People - National Policy on Architecture, and the national vernacular strategy.<\/p> <p> Cross-sectoral impacts, including in the areas of flood relief, agriculture and energy efficiency measures, will be critical to manage in protecting Ireland&rsquo;s heritage assets.  My Department has revised its built heritage investment scheme criteria to allow local authorities, on a pilot basis, to fund works of maintenance and minor repair in order to increase the resilience of historic structures to climate change.  In 2020, we will publish guidance for the custodians of historic buildings on dealing with disasters, including climate-related disasters such as flooding, weather damage, decay and rot and catastrophic collapse.<\/p> <p> Under the climate action plan, my Department has been tasked with leading the development of retrofitting guidance for traditionally built or historic buildings.  This work is necessary to support the commitment in the climate action plan to retrofit 500,000 homes, most public sector buildings and up to one third of commercial or mixed-use buildings by 2030.  The guidance is intended for designers, specifiers, installers and property managers and will make an important contribution to achieving our target of reducing emissions from the built environment by 5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2030.<\/p> <p> A working group has been established, chaired by my Department and including officials from the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, and Education and Skills, the Heritage Council and the OPW, to oversee the preparation of this guidance.  It is anticipated that a draft will be issued for public consultation in late 2020.<\/p> <p> With both climate change adaptation plans published on 31 October 2019, my Department continues to welcome close ongoing working relationships with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other stakeholders.  We are continuing to work with our adaptation partners across government in establishing the framework for the plan's implementation in the years ahead.  This collaboration is a vital component in the delivery of our plans as we seek to make effective use of limited resources.  In light of those limited resources, the initial focus on both sectoral adaptation plans to date has been to establish baseline data, undertake risk vulnerability assessments and continue to integrate climate change adaptation into our existing plans and policies, such as heritage management plans and future polices.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that we must do much more to halt the decline of biodiversity in our country, protect our built and archaeological heritage and take steps to improve the resilience of our built and natural environment to climate change.  Our quality of life and our future prosperity depend on the steps we take now.  I hope that Deputies across the House will continue to advocate for and support the necessary steps, beginning with a commitment to implement fully the actions outlined in the sectoral adaptation plans.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700021#X01000","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592391900,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I call on Fianna F&aacute;il.

Unfortunately, due to the time lapse between when this debate was supposed to happen in January and now, the circumstances in which the transition will take place have changed utterly.  Though only six months old, the document is in many respects a relic of another time.  For example, it makes no mention of the European Green Deal, which will now play a pivotal role in climate action over the course of the next 30 years, and it predates the Covid-19 pandemic and the changes that have flowed from same.<\/p>  <p>  While there may have been some positive developments in recent times, the current action plan is not capable of delivering the necessary annual emission targets to meet our Paris Agreement commitments.  The latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, indicated that Ireland ranked 26th out of 28 EU countries for progress to the 2020 renewable targets.  If we do not make the significant changes required now, the opportunity will be lost forever.<\/p>  <p>  We must look to the future, and this debate gives us an opportunity to highlight some of the commitments contained in the draft programme for Government, Our Shared Future.  Protecting our national heritage and biodiversity is a key ambition of the programme and it makes concrete proposals and commitments in terms of how that will be achieved.  More than a year has passed since the D&aacute;il declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  The next Government needs to respond to that.  The programme will see improving biodiversity as an all-of-Government ambition, one that will see significant involvement by our local authorities.  A citizens' assembly on biodiversity will be established.  All actors with the State need to be on board if we are to execute the change that is so desperately needed.<\/p>  <p>  In the draft programme for Government, commitments in the areas of biodiversity and natural and built heritage are made.  We commit to progressing the establishment of a citizens' assembly on biodiversity.  We commit to promoting biodiversity initiatives across primary, post-primary and third level sectors and ensuring that our schools, colleges and universities across the country play an active role in providing areas to promote biodiversity.  This is about the next generation.  We have often seen our schools raising their green flags in respect of biodiversity.  It is the promotion and development of those types of initiatives that the next Government will have to ensure if we are to improve biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  We will renew the remit, status and funding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to ensure that it plays an effective role in delivering on its overall mandate and enforcement role in the protection of wildlife.  It was only a number of weeks ago that the House held a good debate on that very issue.<\/p>  <p>  We will ensure that all local authorities have sufficient numbers of biodiversity and heritage officers among their staff complements.  All of us have good relationships with our respective heritage officers.  For example, I have a good relationship with our excellent people in Cavan and Monaghan who go to great lengths under their five-year heritage plans to engage with local groups and organisations and with people on the ground who care passionately about biodiversity and natural heritage.  They are the people whom we need to support with resources if we are to deliver on those plans.<\/p> <p>Plans are one thing but implementing and delivering those plans is the measure of them.<\/p> <p> We will support biodiversity data collection, publish a new national pollination plan and encourage public bodies to promote and protect biodiversity.  We will review the protection of our national heritage, including hedgerows, native woodland and wetlands.  We will develop a national invasive species management plan.  We will co-ordinate the actions in the programme for Government regarding peatlands and the maximising of benefits for biodiversity.  We will introduce policies and supports for urban biodiversity and tree planting while encouraging and supporting local authorities to reduce the use of pesticides in public areas.  We will continue to implement the third national biodiversity plan 2017-21 and support local nature groups and local authorities to work in partnership on local biodiversity projects.<\/p> <p> We all have had connections with different community groups around the country that have won the Golden Mile competition.  I have seen the huge importance of that initiative locally when people begin to take note and become more aware of their natural and built heritage.  It also encourages people from outside a particular area to go and enjoy the national treasures to be found there.  Projects like these, managed by local authorities, need to be enhanced and that requires funding and resources.  We will continue to raise awareness of biodiversity through initiatives like the annual biodiversity awards scheme.  We will build on the success of the UNESCO Dublin Bay biosphere and achieve further UNESCO designations for Irish sites, including the Lough Allen region.  We will appoint education liaison officers in each of our national parks to work with schools across the country to promote the importance of biodiversity and the natural world and involve pupils in the work that goes on in the parks.<\/p> <p> In regard to our built heritage, we will publish and implement the new whole-of-government heritage policy and begin its nationwide implementation.  We will explore multiannual funding models and ensure adequate funding is made available for the implementation of each county heritage plan.  I compliment the work of Anne Marie Ward and Shirley Clerkin in the local authorities in Cavan and Monaghan, respectively, for the amazing work they do with very few resources.  We will continue to support the role of heritage officers in the areas of heritage, education, health, well-being and citizen science.  We will encourage each local authority to appoint a conservation and repurposing officer.  There is a huge amount of important work to be done in this area when people have the backing.<\/p> <p> We will build on community-led schemes such as the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund and provide grant aid to protect and maintain important historical buildings in our local communities.  All over the country, we can see how the Heritage Council, the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund have made an enormous impact in protecting buildings where there would not otherwise be the funds to save, protect and conserve them.  Old farmhouses and coach houses, for instance, are some of the important buildings right across the country which we need to do all we can to save and maintain.<\/p> <p> We will encourage traditional building skills and devise an apprentice programme that will help to build a sustainable construction sector focusing on heritage disciplines and crafts.  We will expand the heritage in schools scheme so that more students can enjoy our rich natural heritage and culture.  We will continue the expansion of the national inventory of architectural heritage and include modern and industrial buildings in it.  We will continue to develop and implement the master plan for our national parks and national reserves.  Finally, we will establish a scheme for all schools promoting visits to our historic OPW sites.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700022#Y00300","speaker":"1557","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592392500,"counter":70,"content":"<p>I would like to address two issues in respect of which I hope the Minister will get back to me in her own time, through her Department.  The first concerns the village of Bruree in County Limerick, where the home place of the late President of Ireland and former Taoiseach &Eacute;amon de Valera is located.  A museum dedicated to his life and times is situated in the village and just outside the village is the home place itself, known as De Valera's Cottage, which is vested in the OPW.  The museum does not do our history and culture and the part &Eacute;amon de Valera played in building and developing this country any justice at all.  There is a local committee which is doing its best to support and keep the museum going but, to the best of my knowledge, there has been absolutely no input or support from the Minister's Department.  There is a huge opportunity for the Department and the State to explore the possibility of developing an interpretative centre in Bruree and harnessing the history, culture and heritage of the area and its association with &Eacute;amon de Valera, who grew up there.  Will the Department look into this issue and engage with me, the local committee and the public in Limerick on it?  For such a high-profile person who played such a significant role in the history of the State, what is there in Bruree at the moment completely undersells the importance of it.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise is not directly under the stewardship of the Minister and her Department but she will have an interest in it.  The Shannon Group, through its subsidiary Shannon Commercial Properties, which manages a number of heritage sites - I understand it runs 12 to 14 sites between Galway, Limerick, Clare and Dublin - is proposing to close these sites after opening for only a six-week period.  The most high-profile site is King John's Castle in the centre of Limerick city, on which Shannon Commercial Properties has a lease from Limerick City and County Council.  It also manages Bunratty Castle in County Clare and other outstanding heritage and tourism sites.  If we are serious about promoting holidaying at home, closing these sites at the end of August is really crazy.  There is a huge groundswell of support right across the mid-west for these sites to remain open for far longer.  While I recognise that this matter is not directly under the Minister's stewardship, I ask her to express a view that these cultural and heritage sites, which the public up and down the country will want to visit in numbers far beyond the end of August, should remain open.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700023#Z00200","speaker":"1493"},{"type":"speech","time":1592392500,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I have two queries for the Minister.  First, I welcome the announcement of &euro;25 million in funding for the Arts Council.  Many politicians here and at local authority level were lobbied hard on this matter over recent months and the funding is broadly welcomed.  Following on from that, a number of small cinemas, theatres, local arts groups and arts centres are looking to reopen post-Covid but many of them have charitable status and, therefore, may not be eligible for the programme that is being offered in terms of rates rebates and so on.  Has any facility been opened specifically for those groups, particularly if they do not qualify for the existing programme because they did not pay rates in 2019?  We all know the importance of the arts, especially in this period.  Many of us who attend small cinemas and local theatres miss that form of entertainment.  As soon as we can get those buildings retrofitted and kitted out for life post-Covid, it will be most welcome.  I would like to hear what steps the Department is taking to allow that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise concerns the Harper's Island bird sanctuary in Glounthaune, County Cork.  Both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Cork County Council are doing a great job in funding that facility, which protects the predominantly winter birds there, and the associated local amenity walk.  As I was reading the programme for Government document, I was hoping that all the funding that is being sidelined for greenways and that type of activity will have a trickle-down effect on wildlife habitats like Harper's Island.  Anybody in this House who, like me, comes from a local authority background - I spent six years on Cork County Council - will know that we are great to talk about heritage, ecology and biodiversity but when it comes to boots on the ground in each of the local authorities, it can be a different matter.  In Cork County Council, for example, we have one heritage officer and one ecologist.  We are great in here at talking about the tremendous work these people do but that is not much use if we do not resource them.<\/p> <p>I hope that if a Government is formed and a programme for Government is delivered there will be real emphasis on these areas.  We need to stop using the issue as a talking point and deliver on the ground.  Unfortunately, while the local authorities are doing great work in this area they are under-resourced and so much of the responsibility is surrendered to local community groups.

The Minister's opening statement and in particular the programmes of her Department are laudable.  If is often very difficult to find any fault with what is contained within them.  The fault is usually inaction and not just in terms of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht but in regard to many other plans that are put before us in that timeframes, targets and so on are never complied with or often do not exist.  When we talk here about sustainable development and biodiversity often the words do not reflect the urgency required or the funding required to reverse the damage that we have done in recent times to the sustainability of our island.<\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years, I have raised with the Minister and her Department a number of issues on which I do not believe we have moved as quickly as we should have, including the pollinators' campaign.  It is laudable that local authorities have taken this on but more needs to be done in terms of ensuring bees, the red squirrel, curlew and other species that are endangered in our countryside can start to thrive again.  There is always a conflict or, at least, a clash between development and wildlife as we try to get more out of the land.  We have seen the consequences of this in terms of our hedgerows throughout the country.  Farmers need to be able to earn a living from the land.  The policies of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which force them to try to extract more from the land, have endangered the sustainability of that very agriculture or the sustainability of our biodiversity.<\/p>  <p>  My criticism is directed not at the Minister but at the Department as it has existed for the past number of years.  Taking the example of New Zealand, in its last budget, &euro;1.1 billion was provided to preserve and conserve its biodiversity, thus creating 11,000 new jobs to try to ensure that as a society it will benefit into the future.  This presented no threat to its agriculture.  Many of the policies provided for within the &euro;1.1 billion enhanced agriculture to ensure that it and wildlife could live side-by-side or benefit from each other in many ways.  I would like the Minister to outline how many of the new jobs that have been created in the wildlife or heritage services were created in the last year and if all of the local authorities now have a designated heritage officer to ensure this aspect is delivered.  How much has been spent on the removal of noxious weeds and alien species in comparison to the damage they are doing in many of our wildlife parks and also in our urban centres?<\/p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about our role in protecting our architectural and historical built environment.  On Moore Street, when will the State move to protect the walkways of history that is Moore Street and its environs?  The committee, of which I was a member, submitted its report to the Minister last July but no additional action has been taken since then to protect and preserve that aspect of Moore Street.  I have previously raised with the Minister the issue of funding for local museums and heritage centres to ensure they can put their collections online.

The restrictions on movement over the past few months have provided people with an opportunity to visit local woodlands and beaches.  I live in Galway city and I am very lucky that Merlin Park Woods and Ballyloughane beach are within a 2 km radius of my home.  Merlin Park Woods is a fantastic amenity for those living in the large estates in the area.  It is a fantastic amenity owing to the work carried out there by Friends of Merlin Woods, a voluntary organisation which has kept it to the fore.  For us to ensure our woodlands, beaches and heritage sites remain fantastic amenities this work should be led by local councils.  They should not be solely reliant on voluntary organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  Another interesting point in regard to the past few months is that many people have for the first time visited local heritage sites in their area.<\/p> <p>An absolutely fantastic resource that so many people I know used was the historic environment map viewer.  This documents the different historic sites and monuments across Ireland and it gave people an opportunity to look at those sites within a 2 km radius of their homes.  There was an awful lot of excitement when the latter changed to 5 km and people could look at the viewer again.  This shows the importance of these sites and of ensuring that they are not allowed to become dilapidated, which is unfortunately the case for many of them.  This year has shown us the importance, for everyone, of our own local cultural sites in our local areas, especially if we are looking to promote holidaying at home.  The Minister mentioned the upgrading of these sites and that is absolutely essential.<\/p> <p> I also want to raise an issue relating to the arts sector.  The arts sector has long been very vocal and to the forefront on heritage, promoting climate action and so on.  For example, the green arts initiative has worked with Creative Carbon Scotland and that has been organised through Theatre Forum Ireland.  Their work has shown that while venues have a lack of environmental policies, 80% of them have green ambassadors in their organisation.  This shows clearly that there is a willingness to make theatres more green.  However, the supports might not be in place.  What role is the Department playing in supporting venues, theatres and arts centres to develop their own environmental policies in order to ensure that work continues?<\/p> <p> This comes on the back of the fact that I am from Galway.  If we are looking to promote the environment and our heritage, it is very important that it is involved in everything we do.  Galway had the honour of being awarded the European Capital of Culture 2020.  There was a huge amount of buzz and excitement about it and it included all different aspects of organisations, though there have been issues with it since.  Has a formal request been made to extend the Galway European Capital of Culture programme 2020?  As a result of the Covid-19 restrictions, many of the events that had been planned, which would have promoted the culture, environment and heritage of Galway city and county, have been cancelled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700024#AA00600","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592393700,"counter":79,"content":"<p>The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says precious little about our heritage, our past or our archaeology.  There is literally one line in it which states: \"There will be detrimental impacts to social and cultural assets.\"  Sin &eacute; - that is the sum total.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter.  It is very important that we recognise the importance of our built and archaeological heritage, including sites of historic and cultural significance and also recognise that they are threatened by climate change.  Most importantly, we must recognise what we might lose if that were to happen, not only in terms of the physical artefacts but also the heritage, identity, stories, memories and meaning those sites carry.  It is important work.  Sites are at risk of damage as a result of flooding, storms, coastal erosion, soil movement, pests and moles, fires and maladaptation, among other things.  We have seen examples of this across the island, such as the partial collapse of Dunbeg Fort in Dingle in 2018, the impact of coastal and inland erosion on the Spanish Armada wrecks off the Sligo coast and the collapse of Rathcannon Castle during Storm Ophelia.  There are many more examples which were well identified during the consultation relating to the drawing up of the sectoral adaptation plan.  The consultation document is interesting because it gives an insight into the importance people place on their local heritage sites.  I commend the work of local heritage groups.  I am familiar with the work of many of them in my constituency, including those in Kells and Ashbourne.  Ashbourne is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year.<\/p>  <p>  On the other hand, we have also seen some benefits, for want of a better word, from extreme weather events.  In Meath in 2018, the very dry weather resulted in the discovery of further archaeological features across the Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne world heritage site.  Similarly, ancient skeletons were unearthed by Storm Ophelia.  Overall, it is a story of threat and risk and a question of conservation, protection and management.<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions.

While I refer to this Government, one of the toughest times in my political career was when we took office in 2011 and there were huge issues regarding turf cutting.  At the time, I said at a public meeting in Athlone that we would set up a peatlands council, and we did.  I thank Conor Skehan and Seamus Boland for chairing that council.  One of the most embarrassing times was when we went to Brussels with Conor Skehan, who was head of the Peatlands Council, former Deputy Paul Connaughton, Deputy Heydon and Councillor Jimmy McLearn.  We met Mr. Janez Poto\u010dnik, who was the Commissioner at the time, and said this was an issue that needed to be dealt with and that we needed another six months.  There had been a derogation for ten years.  We were fully sure there was a derogation.  The next thing, the Commissioner and his officials asked: \"What derogation?\"<\/p> <p>We were stunned.  We said there had been a derogation for ten years.  There was no derogation.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time, rather than dealing with the serious issue facing turf cutters, said there was a derogation.  The then Minister, Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, came into the House and said they thought there was a derogation, but we understood there was not one.  At the time, solicitors' letters were being sent and we had to deal with an issue which should have been dealt with nine years beforehand.  It caused significant concern in my constituency and thankfully it has been dealt with.  I am very happy that up to &euro;30 million has been paid out over the past nine years and over 3,000 people are getting &euro;1,500 per year on a tax free index-linked basis for not cutting turf in special areas of conservation.  This is good news.  I would like to tell those who are shouting on behalf of active turf cutters in special areas of conservation that an awful lot has been done.<\/p> <p> We have tried, but have been unable, to deal with commercial contractors.  I went to Clara bog with Seamus Boland, where people were relocated.  This is good news.  I do not want to be in a situation where we blame Europe for everything but are in a position to deal with an issue ourselves.  In my old constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim over 1,000 people are on their ninth year of getting money for not cutting turf, something we need to applaud the last Government for.  It also worked with turf cutters.  The situation should never have been allowed to get out of control.<\/p> <p> I welcome that natural habitats will be an important element in dealing with climate change.  We have done a lot but we need dialogue with all of the various stakeholders in order to get the best possible deal.  I again welcome the fact that &euro;30 million has been allocated over the past nine years to active turf cutters for not cutting turf.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700025#BB00600","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592394300,"counter":85,"content":"<p>Climate change is affecting 19% of the species that are categorised as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list.  This means that they are at serious risk of extinction.  The Minister's Department, in collaboration with other bodies and experts, keeps watch on the red lists in Ireland.  They include the curlew, the grey partridge and the corncrake.  Each of these species is subject to ongoing targeted conservation measures.  In Ireland red lists have also been undertaken for three groups of pollinating insects: bees, butterflies and large moths.  Some 42% of wild bees, 30% of butterflies and 13% of larger moths are considered to be threatened or declining.  For these species, the biggest threat has been the loss of habitat.  Bees in particular have requirements for habitats in order to be able to find food, for pollinating plants and for nest sites.  Simple initiatives like the all-Ireland pollinator plan have helped to improve the situation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister and her Department have had a notable success with conservation projects for well known bird species that are endangered.  The grey partridge, one of Ireland's iconic native game birds, was on the verge of extinction in the late 1990s with a dwindling population of about 20 birds surviving in the wild.  Since then, we have reversed that trend.  Supported by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Boora project in County Offaly pioneered new techniques in captive breeding and land management that are paying dividends.  Following an intensive programme of habitat management and nest protection, which involves captive breeding, the grey partridge population in the area today is now estimated to be about 800.  Conservation efforts like this are literally breathing life into species.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us have used the lockdown as an opportunity to explore our natural surroundings.  The birds seem louder to all of us.  Walking trails around Lucan, where I live, are busier than ever and the Lucan Weir is bustling.  People appreciate now more than ever the need to invest in conserving nature and our natural heritage.  Last winter the Minister met the Society for Old Lucan which put together some fantastic initiatives and projects that promote local conservation.

Along with the historic structures fund, this year's funding for historic buildings came to over &euro;4 million.  This was used to fund 449 projects so that repairs could be carried out in order to protect buildings over the coming decades.  In my area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, this money will be very welcome as it will be used to fund work on a number of important buildings including churches in Killiney, Ballybrack, St. Joseph's parish church in Glasthule and Monkstown meeting house, as well as a number of private buildings where people have lived for a long time and need some assistance in order to weather the change - no pun intended - of climate change and its more extreme impacts.<\/p>  <p>  Protecting our historic buildings from damage due to the more extreme and varying weather, such as very cold winters and hot summers and the impact that can have on buildings, is an important part of our overall national response.

As the Minister knows, I spoke about the issue not long ago and drew attention to the enormous contribution the arts sector makes to our society despite the precarious nature of the work for many artists and staff.  The Covid-19 crisis has magnified this vulnerability, not only today but possibly for months or years to come.  Therefore, it is a very welcome move to see further funding going to the sector.  The arts community is inherently versatile, so it lends itself well to the efficient use of resources and in planning for a very different future which the sector faces.<\/p>  <p>  I will now turn to the subject of today&rsquo;s debate.  It is over a year since our country declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, the second country in the world to do so.<\/p> <p>I often question what that declaration means to us and for us - whether it was tokenistic or if it was a genuine signal of our intent to act on a crisis which threatens the very fabric of our society and economy.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister knows, before taking my seat in the D&aacute;il I was a primary school teacher, a job that often involves explaining complex things in a simple way.  Biodiversity is an extremely complex thing, but it can be explained and understood in a very simple way.  It relates to the balance and interdependence between us and the natural environment.  The balance of our society and economy depends on a healthy ecosystem and broad biodiversity.  We may not fully know the extent to which humans depend on biodiversity, but what we know shows us we cannot maintain a stable climate or provide sufficient food for ourselves if we do not stop biodiversity loss.  We need the plants that provide the basis for medicine and medical treatments.  We need a large and diverse forest cover that soaks up thousands of tonnes of CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions produced by humans.  We need the coral reefs that protect our coasts from increasing erosion and sea-level rise.  We cannot just look at biodiversity as something that needs to be protected; it is a vital resource and service on which we depend.  Unfortunately, it is now undisputed that the very service provided to us by our natural environment for free is being exploited and attacked by us, the service users. <br\/><br\/>We need not be reminded of the countless statistics and trends about biodiversity loss, all of which point in the wrong direction.  My party has long pointed out the worrying developments in Ireland, such as the drastic decline in bird species, the dire pollution of our waterways and the threats to over half of Ireland&rsquo;s bee species.  While I do not wish to paint an exclusively negative picture, I just want to set the context of where we are starting from in regard to the efforts of the national climate action plan and, in particular, the work being done under the auspices of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to protect biodiversity and enhance mitigation and adaptation to climate change in our built heritage.  Despite the drastic threats that biodiversity faces, it is gifted just a few short sentences in the climate action plan and the national transition statement.  However, when we learn of yet another species under threat, headlines are made, concerns are raised and more statements are delivered in respect of the need to take action.  By the same token, if we were to lose key cultural and historic landmarks to climate impacts, I do not doubt that such occurrences would make national news.  It reminds me of the lyrics in the Joni Mitchell song:<\/p><blockquote>\tDon't it always seem to go<br \/><br \/>That you don't know what you've got<br \/><br \/>Till it's gone <\/blockquote> <p>When it is gone, it is too late.  We simply cannot afford to be too late when it comes to biodiversity.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the work that the Department has undertaken, both as part of the climate action plan and also more broadly in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s culture and heritage and the protection of biodiversity.  As this debate is on the national transition statement, most of my points and questions will address this.  Leis sin, ag an deireadh, ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoin nGaeilge freisin, agus go h&aacute;irithe faoin&aacute;r gceantair Ghaeltachta mar at&aacute; siad faoi l&aacute;thair agus mar a bheidh siad sa todhcha&iacute;.<br\/><br\/>I commend the efforts made by the Department to develop sectoral adaptation plans for built heritage and biodiversity.  As a former councillor in the heritage city of Waterford, I am familiar with the importance of protecting our historic buildings and sites.  Not only is it vital for restoring our culture and history, it is a lifeline for tourism in Ireland.  Waterford's Viking Triangle is an outstanding example of this.  However, our historic sites are also difficult in terms of energy.  Heating them is both highly expensive and frustrating, with warmth escaping through every crack and corner - not to mention that we still rely mostly on fossil fuels to heat these buildings.  Given that the Department is responsible for the retrofitting of heritage buildings, can the Minister provide more information or an update on the retrofit plans for sites and buildings?  How costly an undertaking is it and how much will retrofits of heritage sites contribute to the overall emissions reductions of the built environment?<br\/><br\/>On climate adaptation, I did not need to read the Minister's entire sectoral plan to understand the adverse vulnerability of built and archaeological heritage.  It is quite sobering and definitely resonates with those of us who appreciate Irish history and culture.  It seems like a lifetime ago that Ireland experienced five consecutive storms in the month of February alone.  This is most likely going to be the <i>status quo<\/i>when it comes to our weather system.  Are enough resources available for the Department, local authorities and institutions to sufficiently prepare for a future of more frequent and severe storms?  What is the safety net for public institutions to be able to pay for damages done to property, for example the library in UCC that experienced severe damage as a result of flooding, as referenced in the Department's adaptation plan?<br\/><br\/>On the same topic of losses, damages and costs, I want to raise the insurance sector.  While insurance is by no means the answer in climate adaptation of buildings, it should play some role, particularly as we now have a much greater understanding of the potential impact and damages.  Are there any provisions for working with the insurance sector so that local authorities and the Department do not face exponential costs brought on by climate induced damages?<br\/><br\/>As I have already spoken about the stark biodiversity reality that we face as a country and globally, I will now refer specifically to the plan undertaken by the Department.  It is most definitely welcome to see a sectoral adaptation plan for biodiversity, though I would propose that our country needs to go further to make biodiversity a much more central pillar of our policymaking.  I know that the ink on the biodiversity plan is not long dry, but I would appreciate an update on some of the actions specified in plan, for example, peatland restoration and the reboot of Invasive Species Ireland.  Are the incentives for farmers to protect biodiversity sufficient?  Have they gone far enough to meet the challenge?  Having read the EU's biodiversity and farm-to-fork strategies, do we need to go back to the drawing board in order to be in line with forthcoming legislation on land and biodiversity restoration?<br\/><br\/>I will briefly touch on the Gaeltacht region.  The Gaeltacht is a part of Ireland that for decades has been just surviving.  Gaeltacht regions are often marked by migration of young people to cities while their economic lifeline depends heavily on tourism and summer schools - two sectors that will be severely hit this year.  Like so many parts of our country and economy, the Gaeltacht is resilient and adaptive to change.  Over the past three months we have heard time and again about the merits of remote working and digital hubs that save many of our workforce long and stressful commutes, high rents and cramped office space.  In an effort to achieve a better regional balance across our island, Gaeltacht regions strike me as perfect places for further developing business, cultural and community hubs.  Continued improvements in broadband and connectivity are bringing our islands and remote regions closer to us and providing viable options for people to work where they are most productive and comfortable.  Can we build on the impressive initiatives that are catching on across the Gaeltacht such as, for example, the &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta Gteic initiative, which has supported digital and working hubs in locations throughout Ireland's Gaeltacht regions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700026#CC00500","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592394900,"counter":90,"content":"<p>The Deputy asked a number of questions and I will do my best to answer them in the two minutes available.  On retrofitting, the built and archaeological adaptation plan helps reduce the vulnerability of built and archaeological heritage against climate change.  On the funding the retrofitting of heritage buildings, we are piloting a scheme this year to allow local authorities to grant aid maintenance and minor repair works as part of the built heritage investment scheme in order to build resilience in our historic buildings to climate impacts.  Action 50 of the climate action plan aims to enable the roll-out of deep retrofit - it is called near-zero energy buildings - and also new technology installations.  However, my Department is not tasked with retrofitting heritage buildings directly under the plan, but rather with leading the development of it.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the adaptation of built heritage.  I mentioned piloting a scheme this year to allow local authorities to grant aid maintenance and minor repair.  The national development plan was developed in concert with the national planning framework, which should be of assistance.  That recognises the crucial importance of balanced regional development, and clustered and compact growth.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, it is a general rule of Government that no insurance should be effected against the risk of any loss which, if it arose, would fall wholly and directly on public funds.  This is based on the understanding that the risks for which the Government is liable are innumerable and widely distributed and that losses maturing in any one year are never so large as to materially disturb the financial position of the year so that it is cheaper in the long term for the Exchequer to carry its own insurance.  The local authorities purchase insurance in certain instances, such as for public employers, motor and property insurance.  I think we also spoke about biodiversity.  I do not really have much time.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Gaeltacht, we have Gr&eacute;as&aacute;n Digiteach na Gaeltachta, which is a network of innovation and digital hubs, being developed by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in locations throughout the Gaeltacht.

The climate is too important an issue to be the subject of petty wrangling for political positioning or to be the preserve or responsibility of one party.<\/p><p>In 2018 I am happy that we in the Labour Party helped to lead and drive the Committee on Climate Action to adopt the concept of carbon budgets and we look forward to supporting appropriate measures in the strengthening and implementation of these budgets.  There may be times when support is needed from across the Chamber and I speak for my party colleagues when I reassure all of those who are serious about tackling climate change that the Labour Party will intend to share the responsibility of everyone in the House to deliver on Ireland's international target commitments.<\/p><p>This brings me to two sectoral areas for which the Minister and the Department are responsible - the built and archaeological heritage sector and biodiversity.  I have three broad questions for the Minister.  My first question is on the Department's own direct emissions.  What action has been taken to evaluate emissions from within the Department or subsidiary organisations such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service?  Have they invested in electric vehicles and in making buildings more energy efficient?  Does the Minister know if the Department is walking the walk in its own day-to-day emissions?<\/p><p>My second question is on the built and archaeological heritage climate change sectoral adaptation plan.  It is clear from the plan that the Department has identified significant threats to some of the most important cultural physical heritage in the State.  There are a number of case studies.  The threat identified to Trinity College Dublin and the damage done to coastal areas in Portrane are examples of the scale of the potential threat.  What, if any, framework does the Department propose to put in place to identify when hard coastal measures will be justifiable to protect Dublin city and our heritage?  What coastal defence measures will be needed?<\/p><p>My third question is on the responsibilities of the biodiversity adaptation plan.  Will the Minister indicate what work has been put in place to resolve the inevitable conflict between the protection and preservation of habitats, and the need to develop the infrastructure needed to help reduce our emissions?  I am referring to transport infrastructure such as cycleways and walkways, renewable energy infrastructure such as offshore and onshore wind, and coastal defence projects.  It may be necessary to protect our coastal towns, villages and cities, which are often built close to areas under the responsibility of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Are any measures being taken to try to have a standard and scientific approach to decide how we will resolve the conflict between such projects and our biodiversity responsibilities?<\/p><p>I commend the Department and the Minister for the depth of both sectoral reports, and I commend those who worked on and prepared those reports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700028#EE00100","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1592395500,"counter":92,"content":"<p>The Minister has six minutes this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700028#EE00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1592395500,"counter":93,"content":"<p>I will do my best.  My Department has done a significant amount of work to maintain departmental leadership in this space.  The Deputy referred to electric vehicles.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department has been a leader in deploying electric vehicles through its fleet by piloting the use of commercial electrically operated vans in the Wicklow Mountains and Killarney national parks, with a view to reducing its diesel fleet as resources permit.  It installed e-charging points at Glenveagh, Connemara and Wild Nephin Ballycroy national parks in 2018, which was prior to the climate action plan.  It has also procured two electric buses to service Glenveagh National Park.  The contracts for electric buses, which have been co-funded through my Department and the Department of Rural and Community Development, were signed on 26 May last.  These buses are the first of their type to enter into use in the Irish transportation network.  The Department has, in fairness, been at the cutting edge of trying to show leadership in using electric vehicles into the future.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the Deputy's thanks with regard to the arts announcement yesterday and I hope we will be able to do more into the future, as the Deputy said.  It is certainly a step in the right direction.<\/p><p>I shall now turn to the question on the built and archaeological heritage climate change sectoral adaptation plan, which is extremely detailed and technical.  The Deputy emphasised the effects of extreme weather on our built heritage.  There will be projected changes to the Irish climate that will have implications for our built and archaeological heritage into the future.  These changes may be immediate or cumulative.  We have to be prepared to adapt to events that can include warmer, wetter winters with hotter, drier summers.  We will have increasingly intense and frequent storms and rising sea levels.  We will have coastal erosion, some of which is natural, and we will have increased flooding.  The Deputy is correct that we will have to try to mitigate the damage from all of these factors.  These climate changes can be expected to give rise to structural damage to monuments and to historical properties.  The changes will undermine structures and there will be a loss of ground adjacent to structures.  There will be exposure and erosion of archaeological sites, a collapse of unstable masonry elements and an additional slow onset of risks including the loss of historic landscape features and the decay of building fabric caused by increased corrosion of metal elements.  A further threat is posed of maladaptation, as mentioned earlier by Deputy Darren O'Rourke, which is the inadvertent loss or damage to heritage structures and sites during adaptation works by others.<\/p><p>We are aware of all the points raised by Deputy<b><\/b>&Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in.  We have the adaptation plan to try to mitigate them.  On biodiversity, I have been in this Department for two and a half years and I may not be back there again, but I am glad to say we achieved a lot in biodiversity in the time I was there.  I had the inaugural national biodiversity conference with a number of stakeholders.  The 40 seeds for nature initiative came from that.  I also brought the biodiversity duty to the Cabinet, which puts an onus on public bodies to take biodiversity into account in their planning for the future.  We have the national biodiversity action plan up to 2021.  The need to bring this forward is mentioned in the new programme for Government.  I note that the Irish Wildlife Trust said today in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>that many of the elements we have put into the programme for Government, especially for biodiversity, are potentially &quot;transformative&quot;.  I believe they are.  The Deputy is right that climate action is something we had to take a grip of.  It has probably been ignored to a large extent when there have been many words as opposed to action.  The good thing I have noticed in this Department is the constant monitoring and progress reports on the actions that are taken in the climate action plan, which, as the Deputy is aware, will be in the legislation and going back to the original Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act also.<\/p> <p>We have had to step it up and be ambitious.  We have allocated approximately &euro;2 million to local authorities for many biodiversity projects that will bring the issue back into communities.  We have also funded 56 community biodiversity plans through the Community Foundation for Ireland.  All of those elements will help.  I also refer the Deputy to the Heritage 2030 plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700028#EE00400","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592396100,"counter":95,"content":"<p>If the Minister is agreeable, we will go back and forth with questions and answers.  I welcome this opportunity to discuss biodiversity.  Last week, I raised the issue with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  Fundamentally, biodiversity and its capacity as a nature-based solution to climate change and dealing with climate change adaptation and mitigation is very important.  It is an area that has not been given the emphasis it requires.  Its value and potential have not been recognised.  Climate change and biodiversity are intrinsically linked.  We will not be able to address climate change without addressing biodiversity and using nature-based solutions and, <i>vice versa<\/i>, our biodiversity will be impacted heavily by climate change.  We need to address those two issues in tandem.  Essentially, climate change and biodiversity are two sides of the same coin.<\/p><p>There is much good work happening locally.  The all-Ireland pollinator plan has enabled individuals, residents' groups, businesses and councils to make an impact and a difference at grassroots level in the context of biodiversity in towns and villages.  The excellent biodiversity handbook has been distributed to many households this year.  It has inspired not just children, but also adults to make a difference in their own gardens and streets.  That work is very important and I wish to acknowledge and commend it.  However, grassroots action can only go so far when it comes to the important issue of biodiversity.  We need leadership and a national vision on what we wish to see for our country when it comes to biodiversity.<\/p><p>In my view, an Ireland that is strong and robust in its nature and biodiversity and rich from a natural perspective would involve a series of core heavily protected areas that are not subject to economic, tourism or recreational pressures and in which we just let nature be and regulate itself.  It will find its own balance.  We would need to connect those areas with spaces people can visit and enjoy, but which also have a level of protection for biodiversity.  We would need to create a web across our countryside to enable biodiversity to move and find space and protection in those areas and then connect them to our urban areas.  Towns and villages should be as environmentally friendly as possible, with green buildings and green streets.  Developers would be obliged to use existing hedgerows to ensure we provide as many habitats and environments as possible in order to allow nature to grow and expand.  That is the kind of vision that has been outlined in recent weeks in the EU biodiversity strategy.<\/p><p>The most recent time the Minister and I discussed biodiversity in the House was the day after the EU biodiversity strategy was launched.  At that stage, she had not had an opportunity to read it, but my understanding was that she was to meet the parliamentary state secretary to the German federal minister on the biodiversity strategy.  What was the outcome of that meeting?  What are the next steps relating to the strategy?  Is it something the Department can support in its current form?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700029#FF00200","speaker":"1627"},{"type":"speech","time":1592396100,"counter":96,"content":"<p>The Deputy has a good memory.  I had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the German minister on climate change in general.  Most of the matters discussed fell under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, but I dealt with the biodiversity aspect.  Under the EU Green New Deal, member states must ensure that at least 30% of the EU's land and marine areas are protected by 2030 and that 10% of these are strictly protected.  For Ireland, that will mean a doubling of the protected area on land and a trebling of protected marine area.  Much of this was discussed at that meeting.  We are making good progress on land designations, including national heritage areas, NHAs, special areas of conservation, SACs, and special protection areas, SPAs, as well as any further designations.  We are of the view that the changes need to be made in partnership with the owners and users of the affected lands as it must be done in a transparent manner.  I know from my experience in this Department that trying to ramrod changes through, particularly in respect of climate change, does not work.  That is why we have the just transition.  One needs to bring people with one.  We had a very positive discussion on those issues.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a member state of the EU.  Obviously, there must be joined-up thinking.  It is interesting to learn how other countries are dealing with the proposals in the strategy.  We will continue to do that.  As Deputies are aware, biodiversity and nature are crucial to our health and ability to sustain life.  We all recognise the urgent need to reverse biodiversity loss.  We will attempt to do so by seeking to reverse declines in habitat richness in order to increase biodiversity, as well as managing emerging threats from pollutants and invasive species and expanding national park areas.  As I mentioned, we will also implement the third national biodiversity action plan and develop a successor action plan for the period beyond 2021.  I am unsure whether the Deputy has read the programme for Government.

That would be quite a significant change from the current situation, but it is an important goal to aim for.  Those commitments to be implemented by 2030 and, as such, there will be a lot of work to be done.  As the Minister stated, it is best to bring people with one on these issues.

We will look at the EU targets.  It is recognised that in order to meet the needs of the EU strategy at least &euro;20 billion per year should be unlocked for spending on nature and that a significant proportion of the 25% of the EU budget dedicated to climate action will be invested in biodiversity and nature-based solutions.  We should ensure that we maximise these opportunities to increase the resilience of biodiversity to climate change.  My officials are still examining the contents of the EU strategy.  We are liaising with other key Departments in that regard.  I very much welcome any engagement with the Deputy on these matters.

The situation is dire, however, and last year's report showed just how dire.  Some 50% of fresh waters are polluted, 90% of protected habitats are classified as being of an unfavourable status and of the 3,000 or so plant and animal species in Ireland that were studied, approximately one quarter are facing extinction.  One third of bees could be extinct by 2030 and our butterfly population has declined by 12% over the past decade.  We know from the UN report that, globally, this is the biggest ever decline in history.  More than 500,000 species on land have insufficient habitat for long-term survival and are likely to become extinct within decades.<\/p>  <p>  I say all this because I am listening to the Minister's plans for action and her comments on the studies and reports that are promised, but none of them can mask the truth.  The truth is that at the heart of the policies of the Government which, supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, has been in office in recent years and at the heart of the new programme for Government, which has been given a greenwash, there is a pretence about what causes biodiversity loss and climate change.  That pretence may be masked by using the right language, ticking the right boxes, making all the right noises and applauding the climate activists, the school's students and the local communities who try to tackle biodiversity loss, but, at the end of the day, it is essentially business as usual.  We will continue with economic growth built around foreign direct investment, a low-tax and light-touch regulatory regime, and Ireland Incorporated as a tax haven for weary multinationals who are looking for a place to rest.<\/p>  <p>  The Green element in the new Government will talk very earnestly about the climate crisis, biodiversity loss and what we all must do, but I know that, in five years' time, this programme, just like the programme of the outgoing Government, will not have delivered on climate change, biodiversity or building a sustainable society.  It will not do it because it ignores the real causes and, instead, tweaks and pretends that it is dealing with this and delivering a solution.<\/p>  <p>  The biggest driver of biodiversity loss in the world is growth - not just economic growth, but economic growth predicated on increasing profits, the drive to create new markets and the ever-increasing abuse of resources and materials from nature.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service's recent report identified the causes of the loss of biodiversity in Ireland and stated that the factors contributing to the declines include agriculture, forestry and aquaculture, and the ambitious growth targets set for these sectors by the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  The new programme for Government, while ticking all those boxes, cannot really deliver because it does the same as Food Wise 2025 in that is based on the search for new markets and new growth, the very basis of biodiversity loss here and across the globe.<\/p>  <p>  The reason we have immiserated farmers and rural communities is an incessant need for growth, profits and increased output that only serves those at the top of the corporate chain.  Whether it is in beef production, dairy herds or cereal production, it has not served farmers or consumers, or, indeed, nature.  We know from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, that he is pretending that methane emissions can be looked at differently and that, somehow, his Department will find ways of calculating methane problems and find a new way of creating the figures.  The fact that methane is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat can be conveniently ignored.  As climate scientist Kevin Anderson has said, we can fool ourselves but we cannot fool science and we cannot fool nature.<\/p>  <p>  That equally applies to the fossil fuel industry.  We now pretend we have ended oil extraction but the licences that exist are good until 2035.  The pretence that we are now banning the use of liquefied natural gas is also a lie because, although we are banning the importation of fracked gas, we continue to allow the importation of other forms of liquefied natural gas.  Just as this Government and the future greenwashed Government will not challenge the power and the dominance of agribusiness and those who pollute the planet, it will not challenge the power of the fossil fuel industry.<\/p>  <p>  I want to conclude by appealing to those who are pouring the greenwash over this new programme for Government not to do this.  I appeal to the climate campaigners who came out in their tens of thousands on the question of biodiversity, nature and the future of the planet to look to that movement, bring it back out onto the streets and look to a radical transformation of society, not one that is poured full of greenwash.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700030#GG00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1592396700,"counter":101,"content":"<p>The UN environmental programme was very clear that the bare minimum emissions reduction that we need to avoid catastrophic climate change is 7.6% a year.  In reality, as a developed country, Ireland should be aiming for much more than that.  The proposed programme for Government is full of fluff on climate change but it is empty of binding commitments to tackle this crisis in the next five years.  As Extinction Rebellion said earlier today, it is simply not good enough and it should be rejected.<\/p>  <p>  On the core issue of reducing emissions, the deal actually contains no commitments in terms of reductions in the lifetime of the Government for which it is a programme.  Instead, there is a commitment to an average 7% reduction over the course of the next decade.  However, in terms of what will happen in the next five years, that is, the period of office of the new Government, the Taoiseach yesterday made it clear that not much will change.  Instead, he said most of the reductions will happen in the second five-year term.  Therefore, the Greens are being asked to sign up to five years of inaction and austerity on the premise that the next Government will tackle climate change.  That is a bad deal for the planet, it is a bad deal for workers and it is a deal which, hopefully, grassroots Greens will reject.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed programme for Government lets agribusiness, the number one sector responsible for emissions in Ireland, completely off the hook.  The devil is in the detail in the sentence on recognising the \"special ... role of agriculture and the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane\".  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine's inability to explain the sentence, never mind the science behind it, on RT&Eacute; radio this morning clearly shows that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are using this as a means to create a carveout for agribusiness.  It potentially means no reductions whatsoever targeted at the number one emitting sector in Ireland.  The truth is that methane is methane.  Its special role is to be a particularly damaging greenhouse gas.  It does not stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide but it traps heat at 84 times the rate of carbon dioxide.  To quote Professor John Sweeney: \"There is unlikely to be any scenario whereby - without an absolute reduction in Irish methane emissions - the end product will be compatible with the 7% emissions reductions target.\"<\/p>  <p>  The proposed programme for Government is a trap being laid for the Greens and it should be rejected by their grassroots membership.  It is an attempt by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to lure the Greens into propping up their rule for another five years, with empty promises that they really will change this time and that, in the five years after the Government is finished, they will get to the business of serious climate action.  Grassroots Greens and others should read the deal for themselves.  There are 127 reviews promised, there are 68 things to be examined and they pledge to consider 44 promises and establish 12 commissions.  These are classic tactics from the political establishment to kick the can down the road and to achieve the pretence of doing something by setting up more talking shops.<\/p> <p>The science is clear that now is the time for action on climate change.  Grassroots Green Party members are being patronised by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and many political commentators.  They are being told to tone down their expectations on climate action.  We have heard all of this before.  When it came to repeal, the political establishment and the media told pro-choice activists that we were being too radical in calling for free, safe and legal abortion in Ireland.  We were told to compromise and water down our principles.  We refused, we built a movement and we won as a result.  I encourage the grassroots Green Party members not to be bullied or conned and to follow the science and face the truth.  The truth is that this is a bad deal that should be rejected.  There is an alternative based on joining with the left to build social movements for climate justice, housing justice and social justice, and in doing so to win victories today and prepare the way for a left government with an eco-socialist programme in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700030#GG00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592397300,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister on behalf of the people of Wexford for the funds received last week for local historic buildings and for her continued commitment to the Wexford Opera Festival, particularly this year in light of Covid.  It will not be going ahead as normal but it will have a more streamlined approach to see it through to next year when, hopefully, we will be back to normal.<\/p>  <p>  Planning permission in rural Ireland today requires 180 m of clear vision either side of the proposed entrance to a new house.  This is what has proven to be a safe distance for road visibility.  This is mind-boggling because from March to September we can hardly see 5 m on either side because of overgrown hedging and ditches.  I have lived in rural Ireland all my life and while it used to be wonderful to consider going for a walk and enjoying the countryside it is now only a mere thought.  It is more like taking our lives in our hands.  During Covid, more people than ever were walking and cycling and more often than not I received a call to say just how dangerous it was and that people had spent most of the time standing in the ditch because they knew the car, truck, tractor or bus could not see them because the hedges were so overgrown.<\/p>  <p>  People in rural Ireland have difficulty understanding why the Minister's emphasis is more in favour of biodiversity than road safety.  I would like the Minister to understand why it is difficult for people in rural Ireland to envisage a nice safe stroll out the gates of their homes, or to get on bikes with their children, without having to drive to somewhere safer, usually miles away, to undertake the activity, and why they feel it will not work to encourage their children to cycle to school as in the good old days when no one drove children to school.  The reasons are that traffic has increased a hundredfold and tractors, trucks and buses have got bigger.  Pedestrians are not safe on the roads in rural Ireland because the hedgerows are not maintained at the time it is most required.  People feel the green agenda does not tie up with road safety and most of those in this position will not take the green agenda seriously.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin during Covid, cyclists were free from traffic and safe cycling became a pleasure and not a hazard.  However, Dublin is not rural Ireland and it does not have the hazards of overgrown hedges and large tree branches that can break off and fall down at the most inopportune time causing injury.  I am aware of a cyclist who almost died when a high vehicle passed and struck a branch that fell on him.  I had a call last week from a parent who went cycling and whose seven year old was cut to shreds by briars and brambles until finally a briar caught her clothing and pulled her off the bike and they had to return home, knocking her confidence but avoiding serious injury.  It would be nice if city slickers were to understand that to avoid such briars means cycling in the middle of the road, which is not something people wish to do in the countryside, with respect for all road users.<\/p>  <p>  Roadside hedging accounts for 15% of Ireland's total hedgerows.  We have more hedgerows than any other EU country per kilometre but we have fewer cyclists and fewer walkers.  If we really think about why, it is not because we are lazy or because we are not bothered but because the roads are not safe from a traffic visibility perspective for any mortal human being due to the lack of roadside hedgerow maintenance.  The less time we allow for hedge maintenance, the worse it is going to get.  If we take this year alone, we had a very wet winter.  As we have heard from other Deputies, it is going to change.  No one could countenance maintenance until the closed period started, which was 1 March, because the lands were too wet and to do so in those conditions would cause soil compaction.  Teagasc will tell us that poor soil drainage leads to poorer carbon and knocks sequestration in soil.  Therefore, little or no hedge maintenance was carried out and now, with the beautiful weather we have had, which is not typical either, and the rain, we are in a growing spiral.  This is out of control and we can see noxious weeds developing.  This is bringing us to the most dangerous time on our roads.  The most enjoyable part of the year will have passed when the closed season ends.  I hope it is without incident or fatality because of the lack of hedge maintenance.<\/p>  <p>  Lack of maintenance on our hedgerows is counterproductive as it means they grow tall and grappy and cease to function as a boundary or a shelter.  A grappy hedge is no good to wildlife or biodiversity.  These types of hedgerows will not serve as a habitat or provide shelter for nests or the hibernation of native flora or fauna.  To state otherwise would be a fallacy.  I wish it were different but, as I have said, Ireland is different.  We have more hedges to maintain.  We have 85% that we need not touch outside of the closed season but we need to strike a balance.  A total of 85% untouched hedgerows versus 15% maintained in the interests of road safety for all concerned still sways enormously in favour of any wildlife or biodiversity issue.  If the programme for Government is to be taken seriously or to achieve its aims that balance must be met.  Hedgerow maintenance is to a pedestrian or a cyclist what a seat belt is to our driver and safety is paramount to us all.<\/p>  <p>  I do not wish to hear from the Minister that hedge cutting is permitted for road safety reasons all year round because that just does not work.  If it did I would not be here putting any case to her for an extension.  I hope the Minister understands that an extension of the allowed maintenance season would be a step in the right direction that ensures we can all safely take pleasure from our environmental surrounds.  I ask the Minister to ensure she will use her discretionary power and her sense of balance regarding life and wildlife by allowing an extension into August and March to the season for roadside hedge and tree management beginning this year.  The Minister has said we need to reduce risk and vulnerability.  I ask her to apply this to pedestrians, cyclists and road users in rural Ireland.

Section 40 of the Act prohibits the cutting, grubbing, burning or destruction of vegetation with certain strict exemptions from 1 March to 31 August.  There is provision in the legislation for some restricted exemptions from the prohibition during the closed period, for example, works undertaken in the ordinary course of agriculture or forestry, for health and safety reasons, the clearance of vegetation relating to road and other construction works, including the preparation of sites for development, and in respect of works permitted under statute.  The Heritage Act 2018 includes a provision whereby works undertaken for road safety reasons under section 70 of the Roads Act were considered exempted works under section 40 of the Wildlife Act.  The reason behind this provision was to align the provisions of the Wildlife Act with the Roads Act.  Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 obliges landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.<\/p> <p>There is also a provision which allows the local authority to serve notices on landowners to undertake works-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700031#HH00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592397900,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I am aware of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700032#JJ00200","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1592397900,"counter":107,"content":"<p>-----I will just finish the sentence - such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700032#JJ00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1592397900,"counter":108,"content":"<p>The Minister said she has no discretion.

Time and again, we hear of action needing to be taken.  While any self-respecting Deputy would know that climate action is of vital importance, action by this Fine Gael Government supported by Fianna F&aacute;il has been minimal, to say the least, in the past few years.<\/p>  <p>  When one sees ordinary farmers from rural Ireland having to fight for their rights in the courts after they have been severely fined by the Department for having scrub on their land, that in itself says it all.  These fines were dished out to hundreds and hundreds of farmers in rural Ireland, and in particular west Cork, and they are still being pursued for having pure nature on their farms.  Sadly, this had a totally wrong result, as it forced these honest farmers to rid their land of pure beauty and nature.  In many cases, the only way this could be done was by burning the hills.  A bad step, but a forced step.<\/p>  <p>  I remember quite clearly a meeting I and other farmers had in Portlaoise with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine a number of years ago.  We could not get it to understand or step back and stop forcing farms on these farmers in west Cork.  I pleaded with it that if it did not step back, in the years to come it would be the cause of forcing innocent farmers to burn their ground against their will.  Sadly, I was right.<\/p>  <p>  As I said at the time, this was an attack on the people of rural Ireland.  We know the chase of these people from rural Ireland is not going to change.  When previous Governments could not get people away from rural Ireland by fining them, it is now going to be done with carbon tax.  Families will pay hundreds, even thousands, of euro extra yearly.  It is simply attacking those who live in rural Ireland.  Carbon tax is a direct attack on rural Ireland.  Since the publication of the programme for Government, I have been inundated by hundreds of people in west Cork asking me who in their right mind would support the attack on people who live in the constituency I live in in rural Ireland.  This carbon tax may well be okay in urban Ireland, but not in rural Ireland, a place where public transport is almost non-existent.  If this proposal is to go ahead, it will destroy agricultural contractors, our lorry and bus operators and everyone who has no choice but to use his or her car in rural Ireland.  Of course, it is rural Ireland and it was secondary to the last Government.  It looks like it is going to be no different this time and it may even be worse.<\/p>  <p>  Time and again in the last D&aacute;il, I called for removing the VAT from, or at least lowering the VAT, on all insulation products to encourage people to buy them and insulate their homes but no one listened.  Instead, I heard a Fianna F&aacute;il politician saying on television the other night that we will have to live without our fireplaces and without coal.  What have we to replace this?  Is it a candle in the corner?  Is this all that is on offer?  The millions of euro required to replace the fireplaces and coal will not be made available.  Nobody in rural Ireland should be fooled that funding will be made available.  It will not be.  A huge number of my constituents are begging to get the retrofit carried out in their houses and are waiting 12 months or more.  Warmer homes groups are starved of funds for years and years and announcement after announcement of millions of euro in the D&aacute;il for retrofitting and for insulating people's homes have led to nothing on the ground for the ordinary people.  This is where the Government's attention should be directed, not at penalising the people of west Cork or rural Ireland to pay for retrofitting our bigger cities by raising carbon tax to unacceptable levels.  No right-minded rural Deputy will ever support this.<\/p>  <p>  As I said earlier, no matter what climate action idea was presented to the last Government, it was never looked at.  A proposal I put to the Taoiseach was taking cars off the road and running a park and ride bus scheme from Clonakilty.  It was simple and a no-brainer.  It needed a little work, with all of us working together, but sadly it was rejected.  It was guaranteed to take dozens of cars off the road daily in west Cork and lead to lowering our carbon emissions and less stress on overstretched families who are forced to have two cars plus per house in rural Ireland.  This would have accommodated people in Clonakilty, Ballineen, Bandon, Timoleague, Barryroe, Kilbrittain, Ballinagree, Kinsale and Innishannon, all the way back to Skibbereen and Bantry.  To prove our research was right, when the State turned its back on this opportunity to lower our carbon emissions, a private operator, Dave Long Coach Travel in Skibbereen, started up this type of service from Skibbereen.  Only for Covid, it was stretching this excellent service to Bantry, looking after the people from there to Cork and from the Beara, Mizen and Sheep's Head peninsulas.<\/p>  <p>  Climate action should mean climate action, not climate attack on rural Ireland.  My time as a Deputy so far, and it looks like the same going forward, has been given to policing the anti-rural stand which looks like continuing, leading to further hardship for families in my community.  The Minister attacked democracy in this D&aacute;il.  We approved the extension of the burning season to rid us of illegal burning and to have proper legal, controlled burns in this country.  After a majority in the D&aacute;il committee and the D&aacute;il approved it, the Minister struck it out by the stroke of a pen.  As Deputy Verona Murphy said, it was the same with verge cutting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700032#JJ00900","speaker":"1461"},{"type":"speech","time":1592397900,"counter":114,"content":"<p>The Minister will not have time to answer me verbally, so I ask that she write to me with the answers.<\/p>  <p>  First, I want to highlight the fact that Skellig Michael is closed.  This has had a devastating effect on the entire locality around Ballinskelligs, The Glen, Portmagee and the entire area around Waterville and Cahersiveen.  Boats and ferries licensed by the OPW are idle.  Businesses are doing nothing and will do nothing even though the pubs and restaurants are supposed to open at the end of the month.  I appeal to the Government to open Skellig Michael to visitors.  Otherwise, the whole place will be closed and it will have a massive adverse effect.  Will the Government to open Killarney National Park to the jarvies?<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight the fact there is much talk in the programme for Government about transport.  Regarding the summer bus service, which operated twice daily from Killarney to places like Kenmare, Lauragh, Castletownbere, Glengariff and Sneem and around the Ring of Kerry, there has been an announcement today by Bus &Eacute;ireann and CI&Eacute; that it is no going to operate this summer.  That is terrible for many people who look forward to that every year and it is not going to happen this year.<\/p>  <p>  How much of the &euro;25 million of the Minister's budget will be allocated to Killarney National Park?  The State got 26,000 acres for nothing.  It stayed open during the lockdown, which meant a lot to people, but it was very costly to keep it open.<\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed with Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin for what he has done to the people of north Kerry.  He promised them during the election campaign that he would support Shannon LNG.  He has turned now in order to become Taoiseach and to get support from the Green Party.  He is going to shut it down and stop the company that has spent &euro;70 million already on this project from spending more money, from creating 350 temporary jobs for three or four years while it was being built, and from creating 50 permanent jobs.  That is what he has done to the people of north Kerry and I am very disappointed in him.<\/p>  <p>  It looks that the whole debate on forming the Government has been about carbon and climate change and little else is being considered except how to get the support of the Green Party and to get it on side.  This programme for Government is the Green Party's programme for Government.  It is not the case of the Green Party joining Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il; it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael joining the Green Party.  That is the way it is going.  Rural Ireland is now set to pay, by way of carbon tax, for new shiny electric buses for Dublin and Cork, while services in Kerry, to the rural places I mentioned, will be closed down.<\/p> <p>I refer to the ratio of spending for capital projects.  I have been highlighting here the need for the Killarney bypass to be put in place so that the town will not be choked and so that tourism in the town will not be ruined.  It looks like there is no mention of that project in the programme for Government.  I am glad the Macroom bypass has started because if it had not been started before now it looks like it would be shut down and stopped.  Where is the Adare bypass now?<\/p> <p> I am asking this incoming Government to consider what it is doing to the people of rural Ireland.  It looks to me that this programme for Government will paralyse ordinary hardworking people by charging them as much as possible for carbon tax.  It will drive the bag of coal up to &euro;20 and for poor elderly people that is the only means they have for keeping themselves warm.  It will drive petrol or diesel up to &euro;2 per litre.  People in rural Ireland need a reliable way of getting to work.  Electric cars are not that at present.  There is no place to plug them in and they will not go far enough.  People have to travel long journeys to go to work.  I appreciate the people who get out in the morning, travel long journeys, do a hard day's work, travel home again and do the same thing day after to day to keep bread on their tables.  Those are the kind of people I support and am representing.  It is fine to put &euro;1 million per day into walkways and cycleways but they are for recreation.  I do not begrudge them but we should not nail the hard-pressed people who are going to work.  They are after getting a break for the last few months with the low price of diesel but sadly there were unable to go to work as there was no work to go to.  It looks like they are going to be nailed by the incoming Government if it does get together.<\/p> <p> I am calling it the Green Party Government because it is not a Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael Government.  Those parties are badly letting down the people who traditionally supported them over the years.  They are letting the ordinary working people down, such as the farmers and the businesses that are trying to employ people.  They are letting the whole lot of them down in order to get power.  That is what this is about.  It is like the way they turned their backs on the people of north Kerry with Shannon LNG.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin sincerely promised in the election campaign that he would support Shannon LNG but now he is shutting it down and stopping the company that is spending its own money and not Government money.  That is what has been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700032#JJ01000","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592398500,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the written copy of her speech.  It is helpful to have it in my hands.  I congratulate her on the &euro;25 million allocation for the arts.  She clearly listened to the groups working on the ground.  The next step is detailed in their 13-point plan.  The Minister has answered one of those points and there are 12 other points they have asked for action on.  We cannot put a value on the arts so I urge the Minister to go back and follow up on her good work on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned two sectoral plans and biodiversity.  She acknowledged the biodiversity issue and it is certainly in crisis.  I will quote the recent report from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services for as long as I am in the D&aacute;il.  It leaves little room for doubt about the lack of diversity.  It says that 1 million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, more than ever before in human history.  I look at that and at the wonderful plans there are on paper.  Then I look at Galway and we have had a biodiversity plan for six years but believe it or not, we do not have a biodiversity officer.  I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, why that is so last week and he told me it is a matter for city and county councillors.  I go back to the local authority and we have to play all of these games and go through all of these hoops to be told by the chief executive that as of mid-March 2020, there is a moratorium on planned recruitment that was initially budgeted for this year and the appointment of a biodiversity officer is included in that moratorium.  The Minister might look at that and try to answer that question for me if we are seriously interested in implementing a biodiversity plan.<\/p>  <p>  I want to focus on one matter and the Minister might have a minute to look at it for me.  There are so many aspects but I am looking at the islands when we are talking about biodiversity.  I cannot imagine better places to start than with the three Aran Islands and Inishbofin, which happen to be in my constituency, but I highlight all islands in the country.  We begged the Government to do up a policy on the islands.  If Covid-19 has highlighted anything, it has highlighted how vulnerable the islands are, with the lack of a policy, legislation and serious action on them.  I know a task force was set up but almost a year later there has been little progress.  Covid-19 interrupted matters and the meetings had to be stopped for a while but I would have thought that, given the history and the fact that we had an interdepartmental task force as far back as 1996 and given that the problems are obvious, there would be more action and quicker action.  I would like an answer on that.  Where is the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on this because it is the lead Department?<\/p>  <p>  Let me point out a few practical matters.  The three Aran Islands, two in particular, are struggling with a lack of water.  In the time of Covid-19, there is no water.  Sometimes they have water for half a day.  They are struggling with a fodder crisis and they have been dried out in recent months.  We all delighted in that hot weather but they are suffering as a result with no fodder for the cattle.  They are struggling with the absence of basic work on quays, such as C&eacute;ibh an Chaladh Mh&oacute;ir on Inis Me&aacute;in and the c&eacute;ibh on Inis O&iacute;rr.  These are simple problems but the county council did not use the money available.  There is a balance involved with the power available to local authorities but there is also a role for the Department in overseeing basic stuff being carried out on the islands to ensure the islanders can have a sustainable living.<\/p>  <p>  I will leave the Minister a minute to respond to me on the Department's policy on the islands.  Where is that at and can the Minister respond to me on the issue of a biodiversity officer for Galway?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700033#KK00200","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1592398500,"counter":117,"content":"<p>The biodiversity officer is up to the local authority.  I was asked earlier about heritage officers and I know that 31 local authorities have a heritage officer but there are about two or three local authorities that do not have a biodiversity officer.  My full understanding is that it is a matter for the local authorities themselves to resource for a biodiversity officer.  Recruitment is ultimately a matter for the local authorities.  The programme for Government, which has not been ratified yet, commits to ensuring that all local authorities will have a biodiversity officer so it will be examined at that point, if not before it.  It is something the Deputy could take up with her local city and county councillors.<\/p>  <p>  I am working closely with the Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Kyne, on the issues the Deputy raised on the islands.  He has the statutory responsibility for the islands and I know he is before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response tomorrow.  Funding has gone towards the islands but it is something we are aware of.  There was a financial package of &euro;4.7 million not so long ago which went towards the Irish colleges, as the Deputy knows, and money also went to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I will let the Minister of State know the Deputy was asking about this today.  There is the islands action plan and I know that has to be implemented properly.

They are the cultural assets that fall within the remit of Shannon Heritage, namely, King John's Castle in Limerick; Craggaunowen, which is a crann&oacute;g beside a lake in Clare on 30 acres of parkland with a castle and is owned by the Hunt Museum trust and managed by Shannon Heritage; Dunguaire Castle in south-west County Galway near Kinvarra; Knappogue Castle; and Bunratty Castle and Folk Park.  Of all of those sites, only Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and King John's Castle will open at all this summer.  The country is crying out for places to visit.  Hopefully we will have a tourist season in Ireland.<\/p> <p>It would largely be domestic tourism.<\/p> <p> In addition to tourists who might travel from one part of the country to another, there are families all over Ireland, including the mid-west, who may have spent more time in one another's company over the past three months than they had envisaged.  There are parents who are desperate for some place to bring their children for a day.  I say to the Minister, who is tasked with preserving and presenting Ireland's heritage, where better for those parents to bring their children than a heritage resource such as Craggaunowen, as I said, a crann&oacute;g, a living museum with a castle and 30 acres of parkland?  Craggaunowen, for the first time in decades, will not open at all this year.  Dunguaire Castle on Galway Bay will not open at all this year.  A walled garden was developed at Knappogue Castle at taxpayers' expense.  Who will see it this year?  Nobody.  The word \"disgrace\" is used a lot in the D&aacute;il, but to treat our heritage in this manner is disgraceful.  It is not the heritage of Shannon Airport, me, the Minister or the Acting Chairman; it is our heritage.  To treat it in this manner at a time when people are looking for places to visit, are desperate for places to visit, is not alone a disgrace but incredibly short-sighted.<\/p> <p> I had a meeting with the staff of Shannon Heritage last Saturday.  Some 40 staff members showed up.  That is much more than the 15 envisaged under law.  The Minister can prosecute me if she so wishes.  I did not organise the meeting and I am absolutely certain that those who did so did not expect it to be as well attended as it was.  I was very proud to meet each and every one of those 40 people.  If the Minister or anybody else in government wishes to prosecute me for that, they can go ahead.  The staff are outraged by what is happening, not just on their own behalf, not just because of a lifetime of work they have put into these resources, but because of what it says to the people of Ireland about their heritage.  It says we shut it off when it does not suit us.  At the same time Shannon Heritage is doing this in the mid-west, the GPO experience is being kept open, Malahide Castle is being kept open and Newbridge House is being kept open.  What is so special about the heritage sites in Dublin that they deserve to be kept open and ours can be closed when it suits?<\/p> <p> I appreciate that I have not left the Minister much time to answer.

We should always be conscious of them as we talk about progress, statistics and numbers.  Behind statistics and numbers are real people who are grieving and feeling an immense sense of loss.  Our thoughts are with all of those who have been bereaved.  I hope that as we work to move through the next phases of this journey and try to resume some sense of normality, even if it is a new normal, we will have an opportunity as a country to find a way to remember those who have passed away from this virus.<\/p><p>It is hard to believe, but it has been three months since I first addressed this House on Covid-19, and while the world around us has changed, the threat of the virus remains the same.  My ask, in many ways, is the same as it was on 19 March.  We need people to continue to wash their hands regularly and properly, keep up cough and respiratory etiquette, dispose of tissues, and indeed, limit social activity.  Even though people, thankfully, can now move around and see each other more, we still need to be responsible in terms of trying to minimise our social activity and keep our close contacts as low as we can.<\/p><p>This week, I have an additional ask with regard to<font color=\"#00201F\"> the wearing of non-medical face coverings.  It is a matter we have discussed in this House on a number of occasions, and there have been many different views and different debates that have, in many ways, created a lot of noise which has perhaps interfered with the clear communication of the message.  The very clear public health advice is that we are asking people to wear face coverings when they use public transport, in indoor public areas, including retail outlets, when they are visiting the homes of those who are cocooning or are being visited in their homes by those who are cocooning, when they are visiting a residential care facility, or in any environment where it is not possible to maintain one's social distance.  Let us be honest, this can feel difficult, odd and peculiar.  It is a strange thing to do in this country.  Culturally, we are not used to wearing face coverings in a way people in some other countries are, but we need to get used to it.  Just as we pick up our keys, our mobile phone and our wallet and put them in our pocket, we need to pick up our face covering, stick it in a bag in our pocket and have it with us.  It is a habit and a behavioural change we need to get used to, because it is necessary.  It will not protect someone from Covid-19 in the sense of a magic shield, but it will help protect those around them.  This virus is transmitted through droplets, and the face covering makes it harder for the droplets to leave one person and reach another.  Let us remember, as we all do, that a person can feel well and be well and still have the virus.  It is imperative, therefore, that we protect each other from the spread of Covid-19 and face coverings help in this regard.  They are an additional hygiene measure.  I urge everybody in this House to help spread that word and encourage people to wear them when they can.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#00201F\">  I have a second request today.  In general, people in this country are really good at going to work when they feel unwell.  Culturally, we get up in the morning with what we perceive as a sniffle, a headache or a bit of a cough, take a glass of water and two paracetamol and go about our work.  We are proud of our work ethic, but if one is sick, one needs to stay at home.  One should not take paracetamol to suppress how one feels in terms of one's symptoms and then go to work.  We are now seeing a trend where the number of clusters in private households is beginning to increase, and there is some concern this is from people putting off seeking help for their symptoms in the hope they feel better.<\/font><\/p> <p>That is something we normally do, but we cannot do it during a pandemic.  My appeal to anybody who is feeling under the weather or showing any of the symptoms, which are well known to us all at this stage, is to please stay at home.  I ask them to self-isolate within their homes immediately, phone their GPs and seek their assistance.  That is a crucial thing to get good at if we are to try to continue to suppress this virus.<\/p> <p> I now want to update the House, as I always endeavour to do each week, on the latest modelling work on the reproductive rate of the virus.  It is very important to note that we now have a very small numbers of cases.  Thankfully, the average number of cases has been nearly constant for the last two weeks.  Thankfully, the number of people in and admitted to hospital and ICUs and the number of deaths continue to decrease.  I have been informed by Professor Philip Nolan, the chair of the modelling group, that the reproduction number remains below 1 and is estimated at 0.7.  This is good news.  Despite the fact that we are reopening, the number still remains below 1.  As long as it does so, we are continuing to suppress and reduce the prevalence of the virus.  Professor Nolan would also make a point which I wish to make to this House, namely, that the smaller the number of cases of the virus, the more difficult it is to estimate the reproduction number.  While we are satisfied that it is less than 1 and estimate it at 0.7, the need to remain vigilant and careful not to catch or transmit the virus remains as we go about our daily business.  More modelling updates will be given on Thursday, as Members are aware.<\/p> <p> As colleagues know, we are now in the second phase of our reopening.  This week the remainder of our retail outlets were able to welcome their customers back.  The shopping experience is not going to be the same as it was before but, thanks to the incredible work of businesses across this country, it will be a safer experience.  I have seen people go to huge lengths to reopen their businesses in a safe manner.  As colleagues will be aware, tomorrow the National Public Health Emergency Team, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, will meet to examine the next steps, monitor the virus and advise the Government on how to condense or merge the remaining three phases of our roadmap into two phases.  This has already been flagged by the National Public Health Emergency Team at previous meetings.  I hope to be in a position to bring its recommendations and views to the Cabinet on Friday of this week. <\/p> <p> This week also saw the reopening of nursing homes to visitors.  I want to take this opportunity to thank nursing homeowners, staff and residents, who have been working to adapt to this reality.  I am conscious of how lonely people have been in recent weeks and months.  The doors of nursing homes have been closed for many months.  While our new visiting regime is gradual and slow, as it must be, it should be a relief to us all that loved ones now have the opportunity to spend time their relatives and friends.<\/p> <p> I am very pleased to inform the House that the number of clusters in nursing homes is thankfully significantly decreasing.  This week's figures show that there were 256 clusters of Covid-19 in nursing homes.  Of those, 174 have now closed.  That means 174 nursing homes that were deemed to have had clusters of Covid-19 have now been Covid-19-free for 28 days or more.  A significant amount of work is required for a facility to reach that point.  It is welcome news and a sign of progress.<\/p> <p> Deputies have rightly been seeking the resumption of overall health services and I am pleased to say that the HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-Covid-19 supports and services.  As I advised the House last week, I expect the HSE to provide an update in the coming days.  I want to refer to two specific elements of this planning work that I know are of particular concern to Members.  I share their concern.  The planning in question involves very careful and detailed work on the part of the disability sector.  Community healthcare organisations and section 38 and section 39 agencies continue to work together at a regional level in order to plan and co-ordinate efforts.  Considering the very serious nature of the pandemic and the vulnerability of people with disabilities as a care group, any plans to safely commence all disability services and supports must comply with guidance developed by the national public surveillance centre in the HSE.  However, I am pleased to report that the HSE has now developed a number of important guidance documents to assist disability services, including the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services and Reshaping Disability Services from 2020 and beyond in line with Covid-19 restrictions.  We all know from our constituency offices and our own lives that this is really necessary.<\/p> <p> I wish to particularly focus on adults with disabilities.  We have put a summer programme for children with disabilities in place.  Adults with disabilities often have not had access to any service for several months.  This is taking a real human toll.  It is absolutely necessary for many families around the country that these services are opened safely.  I expect progress in this regard by the end of the month.  The publication of the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is an important step in the process.<\/p> <p> I am also pleased to inform the House that work relating to the resumption of our four screening programmes is on track.  As I advised previously, the four screening programmes are now finalising their plans for a phased reintroduction of screening.  It remains the case that management expects to be able to give restart dates for each of the four programmes at the end of this month.<\/p> <p> The mental well-being of our people is often discussed in this House but it has been a particular focus in the context of the pandemic.  I am very pleased to confirm the refreshed A Vision for Change policy has been launched today by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Jim Daly, and is available on the Department's website.  I will be happy to provide a briefing on that for any Member of this House.  Importantly, Sharing the Vision, as it is called, includes an implementation roadmap.  Let me be clear; as we hopefully edge towards a new Government, implementation will be the key concern.  The policy allocates ownership of recommendations to lead agencies and sets time-bound implementation targets against the actions relating to each recommendation.  Who must do what by when is made very clear.  Yesterday, we also helped launch a new text line for young people facing mental health issues.  Members should save the number, 50808, in their phones.  It is a 24-7 service that is free, inclusive, anonymous and there for anybody who wants assistance or support.  Both of these measures come at a time when our world is rapidly changing, particularly in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.<\/p> <p> Many of us have found the lockdown difficult.  Many of us have felt lonely and isolated.  Many people have had to battle problems like addiction behind closed doors.  The lockdown has been tough for everyone, but for some sections of society it has been tougher.  Some of us have found the reopening of society hard too.  I hope this Oireachtas and the new Government will ensure that we confront the challenges Covid-19 has brought upon us, including those related to mental health.  I hope we work together to help people in the same way we worked together to confront this pandemic.<\/p> <p> While I am happy to report that we are making progress we must not forget this virus is still among us.  Complacency is now a major risk.  The future behaviour of the virus is dependent on our actions.  Thankfully, the data show that the level of the disease is remaining stable.  This is due to the incredible efforts of people in this country.  We now need to keep the disease pushed back while we continue to reopen our society and our economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700035#NN00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592400000,"counter":126,"content":"<p>I will share time with colleagues and take two and a half minutes for questions and answers.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to express my sympathies and condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in the couple of weeks since I last spoke.

It is a low-dose steroidal treatment that can be used in the treatment of coronavirus and is now being used by the NHS in the UK.  It has been described as a major breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus and has been found to cut the risk of death by one third.  This existing treatment has been described as a workhorse steroid and is used to fight inflammation in cases of arthritis and asthma.

It has been described as being cheap as chips, with an entire course costing as little as &euro;5.<\/p>  <p>  Has this drug been stockpiled by the HSE?  Will it be made available to patients here?

As he rightly says, this is something we have been hearing an awful lot more about in the last 24 hours.  In March, the Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy, RECOVERY, trial was established as a randomised clinical trial to test a range of potential treatments for Covid-19, including a low dose of dexamethasone, which is a steroid treatment.  More than 11,500 patients were enrolled at more than 175 NHS hospitals in the UK.  A total of 2,104 patients were randomly chosen to receive 6 mg of the drug once a day for ten days.  They were compared with 4,321 patients randomly selected for the usual care alone.  As the Deputy says, among the latter group, 28-day mortality was highest among those who required ventilation, intermediate among those who required oxygen only and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention.  Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one third among ventilated patients and by a fifth among patients receiving oxygen only.  There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support.  Based on these results, the University of Oxford indicates that one death would be prevented by the treatment of approximately eight ventilated patients or approximately 25 patients requiring oxygen alone.<\/p> <p>There was a significant trend showing that the greatest benefit was among those patients requiring ventilation.  However, the university states that it is important to recognise that it found no evidence of benefit for patients who did not require oxygen and the study did not examine patients outside of a hospital setting.  We are awaiting the full details of the study.  I have today asked the public health experts in my Department to contact the HSE about our plans to make this already existing treatment available.  Deputy Browne makes a valid point and I will revert to him in writing on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700036#OO00300","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592400600,"counter":129,"content":"<p>As Deputy Browne did, I pass on my sympathies to all families who have been affected by Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Forty-nine residents of St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel have been transferred to Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel.  Can the Minister clarify that the planned capital investment for St. Patrick's will proceed as normal?  It is great to see Our Lady's eventually being utilised to near full capacity after years of lobbying by my colleagues and I in this Chamber, and by the community activists who never gave up on it.  However, it would be a mistake if the good news for Our Lady's came at the expense of St. Patrick's, the staff of which have, for generations, been looking after residents and patients.  I would like confirmation that the capital programme for St. Patrick's is unaffected by recent developments and that the 50-bed unit promised for the hospital, plus the ten-bed dementia unit, will proceed as per the HSE capital plan.<\/p>  <p>  The confusion around St. Brigid's District Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir continues because the HSE has been vague in its responses which has led to uncertainty.  The resulting vacuum has been filled with rumour and fear for the future of this excellent facility.  St. Brigid's was to be used during the Covid-19 crisis as a step down facility for recovering Covid patients as they left the acute system.  However, my understanding is that only four patients used the facility.  Thankfully, those patients are now well and have returned home.  The Minister can understand the fear that is generated when there is no activity at the hospital and no clarity from the HSE on its future.  We do not need a specific date for its reopening but we want a commitment that, when the Covid crisis is over, it will return to its previous use.<\/p>  <p>  When will we begin to see a return to normal activity in our hospitals so that regular and routine appointments will be kept?  There is great fear out there that people who are suffering from potentially serious illnesses have lost almost three months in their care and treatment with down-the-line concerns about their making a full recovery.  There is also fear that many illnesses have gone undiagnosed during the lockdown which is a serious problem.  Health screenings of all kinds have been on hold which means that we could lose the ground that had been made on illnesses such as breast cancer.  We need a clear roadmap that outlines when we will begin to return to normal and lays out clearly where each health discipline is positioned on that map.  We owe a clear outline to the public who have worked so hard to control the virus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700037#PP00200","speaker":"1611"},{"type":"speech","time":1592400600,"counter":130,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.

As we know, personal protective equipment, PPE, has become a major issue and, in dental practices, the cost of PPE is, in some cases, being added to the cost of the treatment.  The Dental Council of Ireland, the regulatory body for dental professionals, has stated that dentists are free to decide on the fees they charge.  If a dentist is making an additional charge for PPE, that must be listed on the display price list and be made clear to patients prior to treatment.  However, the increased cost in providing PPE is not covered for patients who have medical cards.  This has meant that patients with medical cards have not been permitted to access dental services.  This is discrimination of the highest sort and the Government needs to sort this out.  We need to cover the cost of treatments.  We cannot allow anyone to be unable to access treatment.<\/p>  <p>  The range of treatments dentists can safely provide during this crisis is already limited.  There are mutterings of an establishment of centralised hubs for the provision of emergency dental care provided under the auspices of the HSE, staffed by the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, contract holders.  Is this where medical card patients are meant to go now?  Are we allowing this to happen?  Will the Minister clarify this matter for me today?  It is serious.<\/p>  <p>  My next question applies to the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.  It is important we discuss the matter.  Third year social care students from Carlow IT were conducting their placements when the Covid-19 crisis began and the placements were suspended.  On average, students had completed approximately 75% of their placements.  Those students had hoped to gain full-time employment contracts upon the completion of their three years in social care because they would have been qualified social care workers.  The recognised registration board for social care workers, the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, has stated that students must still complete their placement hours before they become recognised as qualified social care workers.  Could the Minister do something about that for me?  Many students have got in touch with me on this important issue.<\/p>  <p>  Several people have contacted me about the serious issue of the high cost of being left on waiting lists and having to resort to paying privately for procedures.  An elderly couple approached me a few weeks ago.  These people had private health insurance and were waiting to see what would happen at the end of the month.  The lady in question needed eye injections and could not wait because her eyesight was deteriorating.  She had to pay &euro;1,600 for an injection.  These people are old age pensioners who came to me having raised their family.  To such a person, &euro;1,600 is a considerable amount of money.  How can we help these people to get back that money?  It is important.<\/p>  <p>  Is this my second, third or fourth question?  I have asked the Minister so many questions that I have nearly confused myself.  When are doctors going to see patients one on one?  It is a concern.  Doctors have been ringing patients and I know that some doctors are seeing patients.  There are many patients who might be nervous to go back to doctors and to have a one-on-one session.  Can the Minister provide a timescale for that?  When will appointments be available again in public hospitals for public patients?  Several people have queried that with me.  I must share my time with my colleagues so I ask the Minister to come back to me on those matters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700037#PP00400","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1592400600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for being here and answering questions.

I also recognise the more than 25,000 people who have contracted the virus in the Republic thus far.<\/p>  <p>  I want to put on record my appreciation of the front-line workers for the care and skill they have shown and assistance they have given to people throughout this pandemic.  I also want to put on record my appreciation for the cleansing, catering and retail staff for their efforts throughout.  Special mention should go to the transport companies that have kept things moving across the island throughout the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I have previously raised the following issue with the Minister and seek clarity on it.  I know the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting tomorrow and there will be further discussions about the reopening and lifting of restrictions but there are still many questions for many sectors of the economy, businesses and individuals.  There are only eight working days left until the reopening and lifting of restrictions on 29 June.  People are still unsure about the permitted sizes of family gatherings and weddings and whether they should be indoors or outdoors.  We have heard today that about the potential lifting of restrictions for public houses as social distancing requirements fall from 2 m to 1 m.  I believe the guidelines that were issued have recently been rescinded.  There are only eight working days left in which to give clarity to businesses.  That clarity needs to be given and, hopefully, today.<\/p>  <p>  We have discussed the reopening of hairdressers many times in this Chamber but it is necessary.  I believe the date of 29 June was given for that reopening and the Minister might clarify that.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the issue of drive-in cinemas.  There are ambiguities in the legislation for something as bespoke and unique as drive-in cinemas.  We need clarity about that.<\/p>  <p>  I turn to consider St. Augustine's school in Blackrock in my constituency.  The Minister is familiar with this special school because he has dealt with it over the past number of years.  I understand there is a lack of funding for St. John of God, the organisation that runs the school, and that four clinical staff - two psychologists, a speech and language therapist and a social worker - may have to be redeployed.  I ask the Minister to give clarity on that either in the House today or in correspondence.  The latest correspondence I received from the Minister on this matter contained reassurances that the HSE would ensure that a review would take place as soon as possible.  That was in 2017.  The correspondence stated that, until the review is complete, the HSE would not permit any reductions or other changes in services at St. Augustine's.  That issue has arisen again.  Parents are understandably wary and need clarity on that matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700037#PP00500","speaker":"1481"},{"type":"speech","time":1592400600,"counter":133,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Stephen Donnelly wish to contribute?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700037#PP00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1592400600,"counter":134,"content":"<p>I will allow the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700037#PP00700","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1592401200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>There is quite a bit to cover in quite a short space of time.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked about dentists.  As she said, the guidance for dentists was issued from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on 15 May.  Professor Martin Cormican and his team did some very good work which outlined how the profession can resume the provision of routine care.  The work outlined detail on the personal protective equipment that may be required for routine dentistry.  The Dental Council has indicated that dentists should carry out a case-by-case assessment when deciding if additional PPE is warranted.  I met representatives of the Irish Dental Association on 8 and 15 May.  My officials met association representatives on 26 May.  Yesterday, I discussed with the chief executive officer of the HSE the availability of PPE for dentists who have public contracts.  I am hopeful that the HSE may be in a position to assist our dentists and I expect progress on that shortly.  I take the point made by Deputy Murnane O'Connor but I am not keen to see additional charges for public patients or for people on medical cards.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor referenced the issue of social care and the people in the third level institution.

He had an operation for cancer.  He is recovering now and is doing extremely well, but I want to take this opportunity to thank the healthcare workers in Beaumont, on behalf of myself and my family, for the care, kindness and compassion they showed to my husband.  I am raising this because my husband's case is one example of the health service working really well and of the screening programmes working really well.<\/p><p>I have raised the issue of screening with the Minister on several occasions.  I have some specific questions that I want to put to him today.  We know that approximately 20,000 cervical screening appointments have been missed every month.  That comes to over 60,000 since the start of the pandemic.  I fully understand why the services had to be closed.  However, the women - it is mostly women who are contacting me - are expressing dismay at the fact that there seems to be a concerted national effort to reopen tourism and hospitality but there is not the same emphasis on reopening and restarting the screening programmes.  If the Minister opens the newspapers today or listens to the radio, he will read and hear all about 1 m versus 2 m, the substantial meal referred to in previous discussions - that was a feature of my youth coming back - and the bizarre suggestion that 90 minutes somehow gives more protection than 91 minutes.  We have heard reports from Fergal Bowers that more than 2,700 people are waiting for an urgent colonoscopy and a further 19,000 people are waiting for a colonoscopy.  I understand that the go-ahead for the resumption of services has been given.  When will these services resume?  What will the capacity be?  Will the Minister commit to a comprehensive catch-up programme and an information campaign?  Can the Minister confirm that he has sourced the additional laboratory capacity that will almost certainly be required to do the catch-up and restart the screening programmes?  As requested the last time we spoke on this, I have sent the Minister the names of some women who have been affected.  Will the Minister please follow up with them because that has not happened?  I fully respect the fact that people are busy but these women are highly distressed.<\/p><p>Peter McVerry has said that addiction services are in crisis.  We see a report today in the <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>on the disastrous consequences that resulted from the closure of the Keltoi drug rehabilitation unit in the Phoenix Park.  Will the Minister commit to investigating the deaths which occurred following service users being discharged from Keltoi with little or no support?  Will the Minister look into the concerns raised in writing by clinicians directly with HSE management regarding the risks associated with the closure of this vital support service?  Can the Minister confirm that this facility will be reopened?  Can he give a date for that reopening?<\/p><p>I also want to ask about services for people with intellectual disabilities, such as Prosper Fingal in my area.  When will these services resume?  People with intellectual disabilities and their families are at their wits' end.  They see how their loved ones have regressed.  They are looking at July provision.  That is not going to be enough for them to make up the time that has been lost.  The families are worried.  They know the July provision will not be enough.  Can the Minister give them a date for the resumption of the services, including respite services?  The respite services are becoming absolutely essential at this stage.  Can the Minister give a date?  This would give them some hope that they might get some respite or relief.  They are at their wits' end.<\/p><p>I note the pat on the back the Minister gave workers.  He said we were all a bunch of troopers and referred to how we all go to work regardless.  In a situation of a national emergency, a public health emergency and a pandemic, sick pay becomes an instrument of public health.  I join with the Minister in saying to these workers they should not be troopers.  They should join a union and ensure they get a decent sick pay scheme.  If they cannot go to work, they should not go to work but they should ensure that does not put them into poverty.  I do not believe these workers are troopers in that way.  They want to do the right thing but they cannot afford to stay at home and that needs to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700038#QQ00300","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1592401200,"counter":138,"content":"<p>First, I am happy to wish Deputy O'Reilly's husband the very best.

I finally get to use the phrase that it might be a matter for the next Government in terms of some of the broader issues raised by Deputy O'Reilly on sick pay and schemes in that regard.<\/p><p>Deputy O'Reilly asked about an important issue that has been highlighted by the <i>Irish Daily Mail<\/i>in respect of the Keltoi addiction centre.  I thank the Deputy for raising this because I have been following the matter closely since I read of it.  Most important, I wish to offer my sympathies to the families of the two people who died due to drug and alcohol related factors.  We know that drug and alcohol addiction is a recognised risk factor.  We know that it is a key focus of our national drugs strategy.  Obviously, I cannot comment specifically on the two deaths but in speaking about the Keltoi rehabilitation unit in general I am aware that the service was repurposed to provide self-isolation facilities for vulnerable groups during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am informed that everyone in the unit had completed their residential programme prior to the repurposing of the facility and that after-care supports were subsequently provided to clients, including health and social supports and consultant psychiatrist support, as required.  I understand the HSE is undertaking a review of the treatment and support to two individuals.  I will absolutely consider this once completed and we will decide if further action is needed.  I do not have a specific date for the reopening of Keltoi, to be honest.  However, in line with all addiction and residential treatment programmes that have been unable to operate during the Covid pandemic, the HSE is working through a process of resumption of services in a safe manner.  It will resume.  It is the intention to reopen the services.<\/p><p>I do not want to use the time of Deputy O'Reilly's colleagues but I will comment quickly on intellectual disability services.  I genuinely believe the publication of the HPSC advice on the safe resumption of those services is a key moment.  I have met several organisations that are looking for guidance.  They want to open and are looking for guidance.  I will correspond directly with Deputy O'Reilly when we have a little more detail.  This is a priority area.  I assure Deputy O'Reilly that it is far more important to me than some of the other issues that dominate the Covid pandemic discussions.  The families and individuals concerned really need these services resumed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700038#QQ00400","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592401200,"counter":139,"content":"<p>Will the Minister give an assurance that disability services will not be affected by Covid-19?<\/p> <p>I wish to tell the Minister about a situation that is close to my heart.  Since 2007, I have been working alongside a number of families on the issue of a group home for people with physical and sensory disabilities in Carrickmacross.  At that point, the families had already been campaigning for a number of years.  They are predominantly parents of adult children who have been cared for their entire lives at home.  Their parents wanted the group home built so that they could have the assurance of their children being looked after should anything happen.<\/p> <p> Since 2007, their campaign has met frustration and delay followed by frustration and delay.  I cannot count the number of interactions we have had with Monaghan County Council, the Respond housing association, which was subsequently tasked with building the home, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and, in latter years, the Department of Health and the HSE.<\/p> <p> The building was completed in 2017.  I have letters from the HSE dating back to 2011 assuring me that, once completed, it would operate the building.  I have a 2016 letter in my hand from the HSE assuring me that, once completed, it would operate the facility.  I have letters from every single year since indicating that the matter would be considered in the following year's Estimates.  Two weeks ago, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister that was passed on to the HSE.  The latest response I have received is that the HSE is unable to comment on an opening date due to the current Covid-19 pandemic.  This is a disgrace.  It is demeaning and degrading to the families involved who have campaigned for so long.<\/p> <p> I have written to the Minister numerous times about this issue.  Every time, it has been passed on to the HSE or a Minister of State.  The Minister mentioned that he might not be in position in a week or two's time.  Who knows?  In this his final week, I call on him to speak to the people in the HSE whose attitude in their treatment of these families has been disgraceful and to instruct them to get their act together and provide the funding to open a state-of-the-art facility that is lying idle in Carrickmacross.

I will accept the Deputy's challenge and request to take a personal interest.  It sounds to me like many different organisations have been involved; the Deputy mentioned councils, housing associations, the Departments of Housing, Planning and Local Government and Health, and the HSE.  I can only assume that the lack of an opening date may pertain to the safe resumption of services, but I will look into this directly and revert to the Deputy.

I have just under four minutes.<\/p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, referenced the issue of drugs in the context of Covid.  It is one of the issues I wish to raise with the Minister now.  Since the lockdown started, people have become acutely aware of drug dealing in their localities.  It has been much more visible because they have been at home watching it happen.  We do not fund this sector enough.  The funding that has gone into drug and alcohol forums has not replaced the funding that was cut as a result of Fianna F&aacute;il crashing the economy in 2008.  I am a member of the drugs task force in Limerick and the regional drug and alcohol forum.  Between 2008 and 2011, our funding was cut by up to 50%.  That amount has not been reinstated.  We have a major problem.<\/p>  <p>  Obviously, Covid-19 has affected all front-line services.  In our context, most of the staff involved cannot be out and about, so I commend all those staff who have been out and about and doing the best they can in difficult circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  There was good news from Limerick this morning.  It saw the largest Garda raid in the State this year, with 60 houses and other premises raided in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary.  A number of drug seizures and arrests were made, which we welcome.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I also commend the Defence Forces, which I believe were also involved, the Criminal Assets Bureau and, most importantly, the local residents who gave some of the information that led to the arrests.<\/p>  <p>  My first question is about the programme for Government that was announced recently and printed a day or two ago.  I have it in front of me.  It makes no commitment to increase funding for drug and alcohol forums.  We know what will happen if that is the case.<\/p>  <p>  Three weeks ago, I raised with the Minister the deal with private hospitals.  At the time, the occupancy rate in the Bon Secours in Limerick was 1%.  The Minister told me that the figures he had provided to Deputy O'Reilly had changed and were then 30%, which was fine, but figures he sent to another of my colleague's recently showed the rate as being back to 15%.  What is going on?  We all welcomed the deal when it was done because we believed it would be necessary if our ICUs became overwhelmed, but as the Minister is aware, public hospital appointments are not taking place.  Many of them are being cancelled, as are procedures.  Quality-of-life operations, tests and other procedures are on hold for health and safety concerns about Covid-free spaces.  The deal is not delivering what we believed it would.  Will the Minister outline the occupancy rate in the Bon Secours in Limerick?  Will he ensure that the many thousands who are stranded on waiting lists are treated in the Bon Secours?  Will he outline what resources he will make available to increase the public health service's capacity to provide access to diagnostics, such as the urgent recommencement of cancer screening programmes and time-critical reviews for patients on surgical waiting lists?<\/p>  <p>  I have in part asked my final question already.  Does the Minister believe that the funding for drug task forces under the programme for Government will be enough?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700039#RR00300","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1592401800,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I do not want Deputy Quinlivan to believe that I can be held accountable for a draft programme for Government, but I take the serious point that he makes about supporting drug and alcohol forums.

We have seen that in the low level, thank God, of Covid infections among certain communities, including the homeless.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding the Bon Secours in Limerick, I do not have a percentage figure, but according to the note I have with me, there have been 25 inpatient discharges, 979 day cases, 197 diagnostic tests and 509 outpatient appointments for public patients.

Like him, I thank the nursing home owners, staff, residents and the families of residents and staff for quickly adapting to the new reality.  For many months, nursing homes' doors have been closed.  My town of Boyle in north Roscommon has three nursing homes - the Plunkett home, Abbey Haven and Drumderrig House.  They are excellent homes and we are thankful to have such great care.  My mother, who is 92 years of age, is in the Plunkett home.  It has been great to be able to go to the window, look in and say \"Hello\".  The new requirement to wear protective gear is cumbersome, but it is great to see the nursing homes open again.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a matter.  Mr. Leo Gray is a great Sligo Rovers supporter.  On Twitter a few minutes ago, he more or less wrote that, if one was a soccer supporter, the question of immunity to Covid after 90 minutes meant that one could not see a full soccer match but that a GAA supporter could watch a full 70-minute Gaelic game.

I would make the point, which I am sure he will agree with, that they need to do so in a cautious manner and that nobody here is putting pressure on a nursing home to open until its management believes it safe to do so.  A nursing home's first duty of care is to the residents for whom it is their home.  The process requires a lot of vigilance and a huge amount of work has been undertaken by nursing homes to arrive at this point.  I am glad to hear that the three homes in Boyle are doing well.  I think I met Deputy Feighan's mum in the Plunkett home when I visited him and I am pleased to hear she is doing well.  It was lovely to visit that facility with the Deputy.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to soccer and GAA, the virus, unfortunately, does not care about anybody's favourite sport.  It is very infectious and can spread quickly.  The lower we can get the incidence of the virus in the country, the weaker we can make it and the more options it gives us in terms of being able to go about normal life again.  We are making good progress in this regard.  Any measures we bring in are done on public health grounds but there has to be common sense to them as well.  The HPSC provides advice to sectors, Departments and agencies and interacts with them to come up with a safe and common sense way of trying to resume services.  All of that is kept under review.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to the national cardiac review, I know this is a very important issue in Sligo and the north west.  I visited Sligo University Hospital with the Deputy and we discussed this matter.  I need to check where that review is at but I am conscious that it is chaired by Professor Philip Nolan who is also chair of the epidemiological advisory modelling group and a member of the NPHET.

We all remember back at the start of the pandemic that there was much concern about imported cases, with people asking which aeroplane might have been involved or which country.  We need to be very careful in this regard.  I realise, however, that we live in the European Union and that freedom of movement is something we value as part of who we are.  I know that in the Deputy's region, Shannon Airport is at the very heart of its economy, society and way of life.  The Taoiseach advised Government that we would return to this matter in approximately two weeks.  We have to monitor it very carefully and watch what is happening in other countries.

This will involve a number of issues, including the R-nought.  As I pointed out to the House today, the fewer new cases there are the harder that is to predict.  The total number of new cases is a key indicator, as is the R-nought and the translation of that into ICU and hospitalisation and also what we are seeing in regard to testing.  One of the most encouraging things we are seeing in regard to testing is the low positivity rate.  The positivity rate, the actual number of new cases and the R-nought are probably three of the key issues we will be looking at.

The Minister has not been right in everything he has done but one cannot in the midst of a crisis make the right decisions all of the time.  All of the actions to date have been based on expert health advice and have been explained setting out the reasons and underlying science for each decision.  This has resulted in a response from an intelligent Irish people accepting and supporting each restriction and action to date.  It is in this context I want to raise a number of questions, the first of which relates to the leaked guidelines and protocols for the reopening of pubs because I believe they require some explanation.<\/p>  <p>  I appears that pubs that serve food are to be allowed to reopen and pubs that do not serve food will not be able to reopen.  This is anchored in the Intoxicating Liquor Act of the 1960s referenced by Deputy O'Reilly, which is about controlling the consumption of alcohol and has nothing to do with infectious diseases.  How is it that the consumption of food is an issue and that an arbitrary figure of &euro;9, which apparently is an updated figure on the 5 shillings that was provided for in the 1962 Act, is to be the criterion?  Under the protection of health criteria, it is not permissible for a person to attend a licensed premises for 90 minutes and not consume food.  All regulations to date are anchored and designed to combat viral transmission.  This has to remain at the heart of everything we do.  Like others, I am contacted daily by hairdressers and people in other businesses who want to reopen.  We need to have sound, logical expert reasoning to give to them.  I regret that what is happening in terms of these draft guidelines erodes that.  Consuming food provides no additional protection.  Consuming a chicken korma or a cottage pie does not provide a person with extra protection against the virus.  Why would that criterion be a determinant?  I ask the Minister to explain that.  Also, why is 90 minutes a determinant?  We had a long debate on the two-hour rule in regard to this House.  We need to bring people with us all of the time.  The Minister mentioned complacency.  We cannot be complacent.  We must have very clear guidelines.  We brought people on this journey with us on the basis of explaining the facts and people understanding and accepting that this was the best advice.  I ask the Minister to explain the science in regard to the 90 minutes and the consumption of food.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700041#TT00700","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1592403000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his kind words.  I also thank him for his role.  One of the reasons we have been able to bring people with us, apart from the brilliance of the Irish people and their own determination, is because no party has played party politics with this issue.  I have sat in meetings with Deputy Howlin, Deputy Shortall and many other Deputies here since the start of this crisis, and particularly at the start of it.  The approach of managing it in a public health-led way has made my role easier.  I again thank the Deputy in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that viral transmission and suppressing viral transmission has to be at the core of what we do.  Let us remind ourselves of how we got to the situation of the possible reopening of pubs that serve food.  The public health advice was that restaurants would be in a position to reopen at an earlier stage than the traditional pub environment because people are seated and it is possible to move tables apart, etc.  We are all aware of the situation in terms of people crowding at bars, etc..  A number of publicans made the point, not unreasonably, that they effectively operate as restaurants in that they serve food as well.  There are some such pubs in my own constituency.  There was an effort to accommodate pubs that serve food and operate like restaurants.  The Deputy is well able to differentiate between the pub that serves food and has seating similar to that in a restaurant and the busy traditional bar.<\/p>  <p>  I will explain how this happens.  The relevant line Department or agency, in this case F&aacute;ilte Ireland, engages with the HPSC on how to proceed safely in each unique sector.  The key words, as mentioned by the Deputy, are \"draft guidance\".  I appeal to everyone to await the final guidance because I meant it when I told Deputy Feighan earlier that there must be public health advice guidance with common sense.  It is important to clarify that cottage pie does not protect a person from Covid-19.  In speaking about the production of final guidance, I will refer to the childcare sector as an example.  I read everywhere about the debate on how to keep toddlers 2 m or 1.5 m apart, which is not possible.  In that case, the line Department worked with the HPSC to come up with a bespoke solution for that sector, which is the pod.<\/p> <p>That is the space all Departments and agencies of State need to be in.  They should use the HPSC to get the best advice, interrogate that advice and interact with it.  I am conscious that this draft guidance, which I do not believe has been published or finalised yet.  I encourage people to engage and get a common sense, finalised agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700041#TT00800","speaker":"1624","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592403600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>My concern is that we continue to be very clear in our guidelines that the objective is to prevent transmission of the virus, and that everything is understood and explained on that basis.  We should not broker a deal on some basis that is self-evidently not anchored in science.  That is my concern, but I will await the emergence of the final guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  I want to ask the Minister about the availability of a vaccine, should one become available.  Costa Rica has an initiative whereby when a vaccine is discovered, please God, the intellectual property, IP, would be universally owned.  It is supported by about 35 countries, though I have not checked recently whether it is supported by Ireland.  Under this initiative, every pharmaceutical company in the world would be able to immediately produce the vaccine and distribute it in the widest possible way.  As regards our own legislative position, what legal powers does the Minister for Health have to require a compulsory medicines licence?  I have checked to see what the specific powers are and while there are some in the Patents Act 1992 that would allow for it, they are very restrictive.  The patent has to be in existence for at least three years and there are other restrictions involved as well.  Has the Minister looked at this with a view to ensuring that, should a vaccine become available, it is compulsorily licensed here so that it is not the property of one individual company?  Many companies have already said that if they discover one they will create a public IP for the public good but we cannot guarantee that the company with the best vaccine will do so. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700042#UU00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1592403600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>This is a very timely question because only today I received correspondence from the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety about this matter and I also had calls with six or seven separate European health ministers yesterday on it.

We have invested most of our time and energy in trying to procure any vaccine that may become available on a European level and ensuring its fair and equal distribution among all member states.  Four member states have already undertaken an initiative where they have agreed to meet the upfront costs but have also guaranteed fair distribution.  While I welcome member states doing anything that is helpful, I am personally of the view that we need a European Commission led approach to this.  I have spoken to the Commissioner and I know that is her view as well.  I have also asked my officials to advise me on any legal preparations we may need to make here, but I believe Ireland will be best served by approaching this jointly as a member state of the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700042#UU00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592403600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>To be blunt, I am concerned about the European initiative because it would not actually make a vaccine available to everybody.

There was a commitment in the programme for Government to \"accelerate the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare\".  That vanished out of a later version of the programme yesterday but I gather it is back in it now.  It sounds good to say \"accelerate the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare\" if we take that sentence for what it is worth because that is what is needed.  Unfortunately, when one digs a bit deeper in the programme for Government and looks at the section that deals with \"Reigniting and Renewing the Economy\", very regrettably there is a sentence that states: \"We will examine, [which is not a commitment], in advance of Budget 2022, appropriate funding measures to support the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.\"  How disappointing is that?  There was just beginning to be some momentum behind Sl&aacute;intecare.  While many of us were still concerned that lipservice was being paid to it by the Government and the party supporting the Government, we expected something serious out of the programme for Government.  This is absolutely damning and really disappointing.  There is not going to be any additional money for Sl&aacute;intecare this year or next year.  The withering commitment, if one can call it that, is that the new Government will examine appropriate funding measures to support it in advance of 2022.  That is just pathetic.  After all the work that was done, all the talk, the lipservice that has been paid to it and the fact that every party in this House signed up to Sl&aacute;intecare as the national public health policy, it now seems to be completely relegated to some point in the future.  Can the Minister provide any explanation for this?  Is he aware of this?  Did he sign off on it?  If this has been kicked into 2022 or later, all momentum is going to be lost and public healthcare in this country will be set back years and years.  It is really disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  The other matter I wish to raise relates to the policy document that was launched this morning, Sharing the Vision.  We waited for some time for that review of A Vision for Change.  The document is full of undertakings and aspirations for building capacity in order to provide access and take us to a much more progressive place where the whole issue of mental health would finally get the kind of attention and priority it needs.  Of course, it is a subset of the overall health system, Sl&aacute;intecare and the public health service.  Therefore, if Sl&aacute;intecare is not being funded, how can we have any confidence that Sharing the Vision is going to be funded as well?  I would very much welcome the Minister's views on both those matters. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700042#UU00600","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1592403600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>First, I acknowledge Deputy Shortall's work on Sl&aacute;intecare.  I do not say this for any reason other than sincerity, but if I had put money on who would have been Minister for Health after the general election, I would have had her in contention and I am disappointed that we never had the opportunity to engage fully on the importance of Sl&aacute;intecare.  I welcome the fact that there is a commitment to accelerating it in the programme for Government.  I was reading about this yesterday and my understanding is that it was always in the document, although another document had been uploaded.  Acceleration is key.  The Deputy will expect me to make this point, but I genuinely believe that many elements of Sl&aacute;intecare are already funded.  We can debate on another occasion when there is more time the matter of capital being a huge part of the electronic record, the GP contracts and the various capacity projects.  Perhaps this is always the way with programmes for Government, and people may criticise that, but there are not very many areas of the programme for Government which have a commitment for additional funding and Sl&aacute;intecare is one of them.  I hope the Deputy will acknowledge some of the key reforms we have managed to get into the agreement.<\/p> <p>We have different views on Sl&aacute;intecare consultant contracts.  That has been included, along with regional areas and elective hospitals.<\/p> <p> The Deputy made the point in respect of the review of A Vision for Change in that it was key to have it published in advance of the new Government being formed.  It has been published and there is a key implementation plan.  The new Government will have to be held to that in terms of delivering on the actions outlined in it.

That is deeply disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  I want to raise a few other matters.  There is a general consensus, and it was said by Professor Phillip Nolan, that a second wave of the virus is probable.  We all hope and keep our fingers crossed that will not happen, but it is highly likely and has happened in other countries.  There is concern that we are not prepared for a second wave.  I listened to Professor Jack Lambert, a consultant in infectious diseases, speaking on the radio yesterday.  He said we are particularly unprepared in the nursing home sector because it is so under-resourced and so many people working in it are in precarious employment without any kind of security at all.  They come and go and, as has been mentioned, have no sick pay.  What is the view of the Minister on the level of preparedness for a second wave in the nursing home sector where so many of the fatalities occurred?  Is there a document to support that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700043#VV00200","speaker":"1567"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I hope the Deputy does not believe I am being disingenuous in regard to our commitment to Sl&aacute;intecare and I can assure her if a new Government is formed it will be the case that, as I have heard her say, it will be about reform alongside funding.  Whichever party is in the new Government will need to show real contractual reform in terms of the consultants' contract and regional areas, something we can come back to another day.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about the second wave.  The current advice, accepting that these things evolve and are dynamic, is that it is likely that this is going to be a virus that will be with us for a while and will come in waves.  We all wish to keep the size of such waves as low as possible and that is why we need to continue with the public health measures.  That is why I believe there is going to be a need for the ongoing involvement of NPHET and the various structures we have in place.<\/p>  <p>  On the nursing home sector, it will require constant vigilance.  I did two things recently to prepare for any potential future wave.  One is the establishment of the expert panel chaired by Professor Cecily Kelleher, which is due to produce its first document on what more actions need to be taken, how it believes we are prepared now with the measures we have in place and what other countries are doing that we could learn from.  That to-do list for all parts of the health service in respect of nursing homes will be published at the end of June.  The second thing I did was to meet HIQA last week.  I told it very clearly that if it believes it needs any additional regulatory powers, I could ask the board to formally consider that question and revert to me.

It is acceptable that it has been so little used up to now because it was effectively an insurance policy against a surge that thankfully did not materialise.

For what it is worth, it is my clear view that all agreements reached by the State should be honoured by the State.  That is a very important part of reaching an agreement - both sides have to honour their word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404800,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I think the Minister has said what I want him to say.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00400","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy not to tell anybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00600","speaker":"1522"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404800,"counter":189,"content":"<p>Normal people would be speechless, Deputy Barry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00700","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1592404800,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of those who have passed away in the last week due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  I again give my full support to all the front-line heroes who are keeping us safe during this most critical time.  I am particularly pleased to note that there have been no new cases in my constituency of Louth since last Friday which is a testament to the efforts, commitment and resilience of the people of the constituency.<\/p>  <p>  If anything, this Covid-19 crisis has shown us the value of our health service.  We have seen how the health service has reacted to the pandemic and how it is keeping our country safe.  I have no doubt that people will see our front-line staff in a different manner.  They now see the heroic efforts of these wonderful people.  However, we must now realise that in order for the health service to not only reach its full potential but also reward the front-line heroes in that service, we must now take a different approach.<\/p>  <p>  There is likely to be a new Government in place in the coming weeks.  I feel that we now have the opportunity to make real changes, particularly in the health service.  It is clear that the health policies pursued in recent years are simply not working.  I give an example in my constituency.  Louth County Hospital in Dundalk is a prime example.  It has traditionally served the people of Louth and its surrounding areas for over 60 years.  The hospital has always had a tremendous reputation.  Previous governments, in their wisdom, decided that it was appropriate to downgrade the hospital, which was a major mistake.  We were told that Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was to be the main acute hospital in the north east, which was also a mistake.  It is clear that the downgrading of Louth County Hospital was not only wrong, but has also cost lives.  People in Dundalk and the surrounding areas are clear that Louth County Hospital must have its services reinstated.  I have spoken at length on this topic during my term in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  My strong and only belief is that we must reinstate all services at Louth County Hospital.<\/p>  <p>  While I am not going to scaremonger, how many lives could have been saved over the past decade if only we had a fully functioning hospital in Dundalk?  The infrastructure is there, the staff are there and more importantly the population is there.  During this Covid pandemic, Louth County Hospital has offered strong support to its counterpart in Drogheda, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  While I welcome the support it gave, it is now time for the full services to be reinstated and for Louth County Hospital to stand alone.  This is what the people of Louth and east Meath demand and it is the least they deserve.<\/p>  <p>  Over the coming days, the three parties hoping to form a Government will no doubt be seeking the support of Independents.  I want to put on record and be very clear on this.  Unless the proposed Government supports me in my call for the reinstatement of full services to Louth County Hospital, I will not support it.  The people in the Louth and east Meath area have made it clear that this hospital must have its services restored and I will stand by them.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister visited Louth County Hospital in 2018 and the minor injury unit can now treat patients as young as five.  The people of Dundalk, Louth and the surrounding area thought this was the first step in the right direction.  On 27 June 2010, Louth County Hospital emergency department closed, which was a major shock.  The only good thing was that it was continuing to do the day surgeries, day medical services, outpatient services, and also operating the minor injuries unit.  Louth County Hospital has medical wards and plenty of space to expand.  In recent months we have spent millions of euro to use the facilities of private hospitals.  The buzzword is ICUs.  Louth County Hospital is willing and able to step into the breach.  This is very important.  I put on record again that if the Government is looking for my support, I am looking for the Minister's support.  Will he help me and call for the services to return to Louth County Hospital?<\/p>  <p>  In recent weeks I have called for a public inquiry into the many deaths that occurred in the Dealgan nursing home as a result of Covid-19.  What is the status of this inquiry?  It is important that we get to the bottom of exactly what went wrong so that we can learn what procedures and protocols can be implemented to ensure we do not have this issue in the future.<\/p>  <p>  Where do we stand on testing and tracing?  Many experts predict a second spike in Covid-19 and the common consensus is that we need a stable and robust test and tracing system in place.  Has such a system been put in place now?<\/p>  <p>  Over the past couple of months, I have spoken on the record about the 2 m social distancing requirement.  I was led to believe that we were following the advice of the World Health Organization.<\/p> <p>It categorically states that the safe social distance is 1 m, yet we are insisting on 2 m.  We need complete clarity on whether we are following the WHO guidelines or not.  If we are to follow the guidelines set out by WHO, then we should be operating a 1 m social distancing rule.  This could be a game changer for many businesses in the State that badly need to reopen.  They are being starved of business and unfortunately the longer this goes on the greater the chance that some businesses will not reopen.  We must avoid this at all costs.  Will the Minister confirm to the House what guidelines we are following and can he see a situation whereby a 1 m social distancing rule could be implemented?<\/p> <p> I will conclude by summarising the issues I would like the Minister to address.  If he does not have enough time to reply perhaps he can reply in writing.  Will the Minister support me in my calls to have full services reinstated at Louth County Hospital?  Will the Minister give the House an update on the progress of a full public inquiry into the set of circumstances around the many deaths due to the Covid-19 pandemic?  Will the Minister update the house on the testing and tracing system currently in place and does the Minister believe this to be robust enough should we suffer a second surge of the virus?  Will the Minister update the House on whether we will adopt the guidelines of the World Health Organization in implementing a social distance rule of 1 m, as opposed to 2 m?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700044#WW00800","speaker":"1600","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592405400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for the questions.  My own leader, the Taoiseach, will be watching on the monitor to make sure I am not negotiating arrangements with Independents.  That is certainly above my pay grade.<\/p>  <p>  I take very seriously the issues raised by the Deputy.  We got much work done on investment in the healthcare services in Louth.  I recall visiting Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital with Deputy Fitzpatrick when I was first appointed as the Minister for Health.  I remember it as a very overcrowded hospital.  We have seen significant improvements there with regard to much additional bed capacity and a really good management team and staff, to whom I pay tribute.  I also visited the Louth County Hospital in Dundalk with the Deputy.  I was struck by the dedication, especially to the rehabilitation work that goes on there, and in respect of the Deputy's campaign on the minor injury unit age-appropriate usage, which we were able to reduce to the age of five.  It is a brilliant hospital.  The policy is to make all hospitals able to provide the full range of services that are appropriate for it.  As the Deputy already pointed out, the Drogheda and Dundalk hospitals have been working together during this pandemic.  It is about identifying what more hospitals such as the Louth County Hospital can do, and to invest in them to do that.  I am more than happy to talk about that in more detail at some time.<\/p>  <p>  I will write to the Deputy on the Dealgan nursing home.  I understand HIQA was due to carry out an inspection there.  I had said I was going to await the outcome of the HIQA report to decide what further actions are needed.  I know it has been a very difficult and traumatic time for people with regard to the Dealgan nursing home.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the issue of testing and tracing.  Significant progress is being made.  We now see that in some 90% of cases the turnaround time from referral to completion of contact tracing is three days or less.  I recognise the HSE's hard work to achieve the target it set itself in its testing and tracing roadmap, which was published last month.  Encouragingly, we now see a positivity rate of only 0.8%.  This means that almost 99% of people who have had a test are negative.  This is a good sign.  On Monday of this week, a zero prevalence study commenced in Ireland using the antibody testing.  This study will measure the exposure to Covid-19 infection in a representative sample of the population in Dublin, where we have seen a high level of cases, and in Sligo where we have seen a low level of cases.  We expect initial results from this study in late August.  This will provide us with an overall national estimate of infection in the Irish population.  NPHET has recommended that all healthcare workers in nursing homes be tested weekly for the next four weeks.  All close contacts are now being tested and negative results are delivered by text message.  The median and average number of close contacts per case over April and May has been very steady also.  I am satisfied there is capacity now in place to do 15,000 tests a day.  There has been good progress, but it is an area that requires constant vigilance.<\/p>  <p>  On the 2 m versus 1 m distance, the clear view is that 2 m is safer than 1 m.  The public health advice we follow is the 2 m rule.  I heard the WHO representative, through video link in this Chamber, saying that 2 m is safer than 1 m.  I have also made the point that we will need to provide bespoke solutions for some sectors, for example, 2 m and 1 m was not going to work in childcare.  I have said very clearly that we need to get our kids back to school.  We need a bespoke solution to reopen our schools that is safe and grounded in public health advice.  The Deputy will be aware that we have also had the discussion about new guidance being drawn up for the hospitality sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700045#XX00200","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592405400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I am glad to get the opportunity to talk about certain issues regarding health.  I put it to the Minister that the testing is not yet satisfactory.  If the Minister does not have time to respond to me verbally perhaps he will respond in writing.  I ask the Minister to confirm or deny that there is just one laboratory doing the testing for all the country.  Is the Minister aware there are other companies supplying test kits?  Even Abbott is supposed to have supplied much of its product to the United States of America.  Its test kits perform the test and give a result in 15 minutes.  Why can we not have something like that?  We are all very thankful that the figures are down but surely if they were to rise even factionally it would be very important to test people as soon as possible and follow up with contact tracing to confine any cases that may arise and to keep it to a minimum.<\/p>  <p>  People who have other health problems are having serious difficulties in accessing their consultants and doctors.  It is constant.  We are on our phones every day trying to get people their appointments with their consultants, but it is not happening.  These are people with coronary and cancer problems.  They are patients looking to get hip and knee operations and who are in serious pain.  People are losing their sight and going blind due to needing cataract operations.  Indeed, I was told recently that when Covid-19 was beginning two patients were not seen by their consultant and were told to \"Take this\" or \"Take that\".  Both of them died within a couple of days.  I put it to the Minister that this is not satisfactory.  This happened at the height of the virus.  People who had other health problems and who tried to see their consultant were put off and it did not happen.  That is very serious.  We do not want any more of that to happen.<\/p>  <p>  As an elected representative many people raise issues with me and I have to raise them in here.  Many people regret what happened with the Italians when they came here.  If the teams had been allowed to play but the supporters had not allowed to come it may have been as bad.  People feel that we exposed ourselves then.  There is also the issue of people who were returning from Cheltenham.  There were no checks and people regret that also.  We give praise where it is due, which I have done, but I must express the disappointment of so many people who regret that those things happened and exposed so many people to the virus.  The Italians had it then.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to do whatever it takes to open things up and get the consultants to see people, to see what the blockage is, which is serious, and to make sure people are not being denied assistance in their hour of need.  Stage 2 very quickly becomes stage 3, and stage 3 very quickly becomes stage 4.  That is then the end of the line.  I appeal to the Minister in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700045#XX00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1592406000,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I have two and a half minutes of questions and I ask the Minister to afford me two and a half minutes of answers.  I ask him to forward in writing any answers he cannot provide now.  Three weeks ago, I asked him about congregated settings and Bantry General Hospital.  I thank him for the answers which were furnished to me this morning.<\/p>  <p>  A little bit of clarity is needed on congregated settings.  Was a risk assessment on infection control carried out before the statutory instrument was signed in July 2016?  If so, will he supply that assessment to me?  The Minister failed to answer my question on whether all community hospitals, such as Clonakilty Community Hospital, will be brought up to standard by the extended date of January 2021.  Will the deadline in that regard be met?  In the context of Covid-19, does the Minister accept that the statutory instrument which resulted in the date for community hospitals to be brought up to standard being pushed out has cost lives?  I am asking that question in light of answers I received from representatives of HIQA at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.<\/p>  <p>  On Bantry General Hospital, I am still awaiting answers to questions I asked on the last occasion I spoke to the Minister.  If someone in Bantry or elsewhere in west Cork suffers a trauma, is there a policy whereby an ambulance will only take that person to Cork University Hospital, CUH?  Are ambulances bypassing Bantry General Hospital?  I indicated that may be the case on the previous occasion I spoke to the Minister.  I told him about an 89 year old lady from Bantry who had a broken pelvis and whose family, when they contacted the ambulance service, were told that she had to go to CUH at 10 a.m.  However, the family refused and instead took her directly to Bantry General Hospital.  Thankfully, she is being well cared for and looked after there.  The Minister told me he would provide an answer to that question.  I would appreciate receiving it.<\/p>  <p>  Are there plans to replace the current anaesthetist at the hospital, who is due to retire within the next year, and recruit a second full-time anaesthetist to ensure the hospital will remain a strong and viable general hospital which plays a very important role for the large rural population of well over 80,000 people whom it serves?  If the Minister tells me that anaesthetist will be hired, I will know the future of the hospital is secure.<\/p>  <p>  I have always encouraged the provision of new services at Bantry General Hospital.  I invite the Minister to prove his intent to keep the excellent services that exist there and add to them.  For some time now, the staff of the hospital have been expressing the need for a fracture clinic.  This orthopaedic facility would be invaluable for the people of west Cork.  What are the plans for such a clinic in Bantry?<\/p>  <p>  Has the Government sourced PPE production units in Ireland, as well as additional laboratories for Covid tests, to be used in the event of a second wave of Covid?

It is due to provide restart dates for all four screening programmes by the end of this month.  The restart date and a plan for how it intends to recommence will be shared with all Deputies and, most important, service users, women and men, by the end of this month.<\/p>  <p>  On PPE, I am constantly in discussions with the HSE on this issue.  Obviously, it needs to ensure we have enough PPE equipment not just for now, but for any second wave that may come.  It has done a very good job of securing a supply line, something that, sadly, not every country managed to do.  We are now looking at how we can ramp up domestic production where appropriate and are using our State agencies to assist in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  I will revert to the Deputy on the plans to hire an anaesthetist for Bantry General Hospital.  It sounds to me like a very sensible and important thing to do, but it is a matter for the HSE and I will discuss the matter with it.<\/p>  <p>  I apologise that nobody reverted to the Deputy regarding the National Ambulance Service and his 89 year old constituent.  Last week, he told me about the proposal to bring her to CUH rather than Bantry and the family involvement thereafter.  I will make sure he receives a written response on that issue.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to write to the Deputy regarding congregated settings in Bantry.  He has asked two specific questions regarding the risk assessment and whether the extended date deadline will be met.  I will provide answers in writing to those questions.<\/p>  <p>  On the loss of life in nursing homes, there is a sad multitude of reasons for this.  In the middle of the pandemic, it is, perhaps, too soon to be able to identify fully those reasons.

Obviously, we need to keep that going.  On testing, my understanding is that there are more than 40 laboratories involved in testing.  We are always looking for new testing methodologies.  The Deputy referred to such a test.  HIQA carries out our health technology assessments.  We are always interested in the identification of new and better tests.<\/p>  <p>  I take seriously the point made by the Deputy on reopening the health service.

What role will it take to ensure that equipment is replaced?  Obviously, it will be of vital importance in the ongoing fight against Covid in County Donegal.  It is of vital importance that it be replaced and that there will be no interruption to supply in the county.  I ask the Minister to address that issue.<\/p>  <p>  On alcohol and alcohol sales during lockdown, it was distressing for me to read of sales of alcohol having increased because pubs have been closed.  It is a bit horrific, particularly when one considers that there are 88 alcohol-related deaths per month and that more than 200,000 children live in homes where parental alcohol misuse is a problem.  A national campaign was started by the alcohol forum in Donegal and the Irish community action on alcohol network is entitled \"Deliver change on drink deliveries\".  Interestingly, there has been a 15% increase in online sales of alcohol during the pandemic.  Will the Minister support the aims of that campaign and change the process for the online purchase of alcohol?

I will speak to the HSE directly through my Department to ensure that the equipment is replaced without any interruption to supply.  I will confirm that in writing to the Deputy or ask that the HSE does so.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the important issue of alcohol use.  There has been a lot of talk about Covid-19 and it is very important that it is discussed.  However, just beneath the surface there is much hidden pain and additional impact.  Alcohol use is one of the causes of that pain.  We all are or were being asked to stay at home, and home is a safe place for many of us, but some people, including many children, are not in a safe environment when they close the hall door.  We know that may be the case in homes where there is an alcohol or other addiction.  I very much welcome the work of the alcohol forum in Donegal and would be very pleased to hear from it and support its work in any way I can.  There were 1,000 days of stalling before we managed to pass the Public Health (Alcohol) Act through the Houses.  Its passage was hard won.  In fairness, we listened and made improvements to it to try to get it right.  It was the first time in the history of the State for public health legislation dealing with alcohol to be passed.  The only thing this House had previously ever done in the context of alcohol was to stick a levy on it or decide on budget day how much excise to put on it.  We had never used public health legislation for alcohol and I am very proud that we did so in the previous Oireachtas.  One of the disappointments is that we could not deal effectively with the online piece.  There were many debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on the matter, as well matters relating to Europe and so on.  I would set this new Oireachtas the challenge of dealing with that issue, perhaps working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and at a European level.  There is a vulnerability because the protections we put in place in the context of offline alcohol sales are not yet in place online.  I would welcome the views of Deputy Harkin, as a former MEP, on how we can work on this issue at European level.  That is a challenge for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700046#YY00500","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"speech","time":1592406000,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Carers employed by the HSE are literally running around the country, spending 30 minutes in one house, perhaps getting somebody up and dressed and preparing breakfast, and are then out the door and off to another house etc.  The service has been cut to the bone.  It is care on speed.<\/p> <p>Those carers are being asked to don PPE and take it off, put on face masks, practise hand hygiene and so on.  All I am asking is that some extra time would be provided to those workers to allow them to give quality care without any diminution of services.<br\/><br\/>The second issue concerns the new document published by the HSE, the Framework for the Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services.  We would all accept that family carers of adults with disabilities were abandoned from 16 March.  While I am not apportioning blame, we recognise that people were left basically locked in their own homes and we have to ensure that does not happen again.  If I were the parent of a person with a disability and I read this document, which I have, I would be absolutely devastated.  As one carer said to me less than two hours ago, &quot;Everything we fought for over the last 30 years is disappearing in front of our eyes&quot;.  Upfront, this document states: &quot;... the resumption of services will result in service users receiving a reduced quantum of service supports&quot;, and it describes this as the &quot;new normality&quot;.  It goes on to say that the reduction in the quantum of service will lead to greater reliance on service users' families and carers.  In simple language, the HSE is saying: &quot;We are cutting back front-line services and it will fall back on families - get used to it.&quot;<br\/><br\/>This is in direct contradiction of what is in the proposed new programme for Government, which, on page 79, under the heading Day Services and Supports, states:<\/p><blockquote>\tWe will:<br \/><br \/>- [commit] to expand adult day services and supports ...<br \/><br \/>- Deliver increased home support and Personal Assistance hours. <\/blockquote> <p>Has anybody told the HSE about this?  Has anybody told the HSE that its plan contradicts another commitment in the programme for Government, namely, the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Article 24 of which refers to the rights of persons with disabilities to education at all levels and lifelong learning?<br\/><br\/>If schools and cr&egrave;ches can reopen, why not day centres for people with disabilities?  If shopping centres, hotels and pubs can reopen, why not day centres for people with disabilities?  I am not saying this is simple because it is not.  If the HSE had said resumption of services would be somewhat reduced at the start but that it would use all means at its disposal to increase day services, or if it had consulted with family carers before it announced its decision, which incidentally, is another commitment listed on page 78 of the proposed new programme for Government, then there would be the inclusive approach it speaks of in its document, but it did not do so.<br\/><br\/>The HSE document states: &quot;The Government&rsquo;s plan for reopening the country sets out phases which indicate a very gradual lessening of restrictions over the coming months.&quot;  That is not factually correct.  We started out with five phases and now there are four.  We are in phase 2-plus.  The third phase will run from 29 June and the fourth from 20 July.  Part of the basis for the HSE decision is factually flawed.<br\/><br\/>I do not normally use up all the speaking time but I feel very strongly about this matter.  The HSE document refers to the use of technology, such as Zoom and video.  What about those who do not have access to the Internet, those who are non-verbal or have language disability, those who have a visual disability, or those whose attention span will not allow them to participate and who will take one look at the screen and walk away?  As one carer said to me, what about the nitty-gritty everyday challenges that parents face in the context of toileting and what we euphemistically refer to as challenging behaviours?<br\/><br\/>I have two asks.  First, I ask that it is explicitly stated that this is not the new normal but a temporary adjustment until the levels of service can be reinstated and expanded, as promised, and that there is a timeframe.  Second, I ask that the extra supports that carers need will be put in place at the same time that services are reduced, so as not to have carers begging for them forever.

These people and their families have been left largely on their own due to this pandemic and we need to get the services back up and running.  Not all day centres are the same, nor are all service users the same.  There should not be one crude document that fits all.  It will require engagement and I will make sure there is real meaningful engagement with the associations and directly with people with disabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700047#ZZ00300","speaker":"1624"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1592406600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 4.35 p.m. and resumed at 4.55 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development: Statements (Resumed)","time":1592407200,"counter":204,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700048#BBB00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1592407200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>I am pleased to present to the House the annual adaptation transition statement on the policy measures adopted by the Office of Public Works during the past year.  Deputies are aware of Ireland's history of flooding, including the widespread severe floods from rivers and turloughs over the winter of 2015 to 2016, the flash floods in the Inishowen Peninsula and in Mountmellick, County Laois, in 2017 and the floods along the River Shannon earlier this year.  Deputies also aware of the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which is the largest national study ever undertaken on our risk from significant flooding events and it has followed best practice in the area.  The programme studied the flood risk for two thirds of our population.  It looked not only at flood risk and its impact today but also studied its impact in two potential climate change scenarios.  These scenarios are in line with the most recent evidence from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and research that has been undertaken in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  To date, the OPW has completed 46 flood relief schemes at a cost of &euro;400 million.  These include schemes in Clonmel, Kilkenny and Fermoy.  They protect approximately 10,000 properties, with approximately &euro;2 billion worth of damage avoided to date.  In May 2018, the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, was pleased to announce with the Taoiseach a &euro;1 billion investment in flood risk management as part of Project Ireland 2040.  This is supported by the evidence from the CFRAM programme that provided 150 additional flood relief schemes.  With the provision of these schemes, the Government can protect 95% of properties assessed to be at significant risk from flooding from rivers and the sea.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2018, the number of food relief schemes under design and construction in partnership with local authorities has trebled to 92.  This means the OPW and local authorities have completed, or are working to protect, 80% of those properties to be protected during the ten year programme.  The development of these schemes includes consideration of, and planning for, adaptation measures aimed at maintaining the same level of protection to these communities from the changing flood risk due to climate change.  All schemes are designed and built in line with international best practice to avoid causing flood risk elsewhere.  The design of the schemes is informed by detailed environmental assessment, public consultation and economic appraisal and they goes through the full planning permission process under the appropriate legislation.<\/p> <p>The panel on climate change has reported that for a 1.5&deg;C rise in temperature the global mean sea level could rise by approximately 1 m by 2100.  These estimates for climate change will have significant impacts on flooding and flood risk in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>In the context of this IPCC report, the OPW prepared a climate change sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management between 2019 and 2024 in line with the requirements of the national adaptation framework and the climate action plan of 2019.  The plan was consulted upon before being approved by Government last October.  It sets out a long-term goal for adaptation and flood risk management to promote sustainable communities and to support our environment through the effective management of the potential impacts of climate change on flooding and flood risk.  It includes a range of actions: enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the potential impact of climate change for flooding and flood risk management; adapting our flood risk management practice to effectively manage the potential impacts of climate change and future flood risk; and aligning adaptation with regard to flood risk across sectors and wider Government policy including, in particular, planning.  The main actions at the moment focus on: assessment of risk from climate change; the inclusion of adaptation in flood relief schemes; and the consideration of potential future flood scenarios in planning and development management.  Progress is now being made.<br\/><br\/>Maps of future flood extents under climate change scenarios have been published on the web portal<i>floodinfo.ie<\/i>.  The OPW is providing funding to the eastern and midlands climate action regional office for further research.  Assessments have begun into the adoptability of those completed flood relief schemes.  The design brief for future schemes now includes a requirement to consider a plan for adaptation needs and work towards the establishment of a national flood forecasting and warning service is ongoing to build resilience for the future.<br\/><br\/>It is also important to talk about the measures we have put in place for those properties at risk where investment in a flood relief scheme is not feasible.  The minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme remains an important measure for addressing this risk.  In 2019, the OPW approved almost &euro;5 million in funding to local authorities for nearly 50 such schemes.  This brings the total committed investment under the scheme to more than &euro;39 million for nearly 900 projects protecting some 7,000 properties.  Two thirds of those are in areas outside of those communities studied by the CFRAM programme.  The work of the cross-Government interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group, chaired by the Minister of State, Kevin &quot;Boxer&quot; Moran, is also focused on climate change adaptation measures for future flood risk management.  Significant progress this year has been achieved by Met &Eacute;ireann, overseen by the OPW, towards establishing the flood forecasting service.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, the work by the OPW in the past 12 months in adopting measures to adapt for climate change has been significant.  In particular, the delivery of flood relief schemes and the publication of the sectoral adaptation plan demonstrates our continued approach to addressing the possible impact of climate change in our planning to manage flood risk, the delivery of flood relief schemes and working across Government to manage risk in the future.  I am confident that our focus on climate change in flood risk management will allow our investment today to cope with and be adaptable to deal with the impact of climate change in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700048#BBB00200","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592407500,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The impacts of climate change are already evident for us all to see.  In recent years, Ireland has witnessed heavier rainfall, stronger, more destructive storms and more flooding events than at any time previously.  If we consider the impact of Covid-19 on our economy and our society in recent months, we need to multiply that when we consider the potential impacts of climate change on our country and indeed the world.  It is highly likely that climate change will significantly increase the flood risk in Ireland due to rising sea levels, increased rainfall in winter, more heavy rain days and more intense storms.<\/p>  <p>  It is crucial, though, first to tackle the causes of climate change rather than simply protecting against its impact.  This week the respective parties have agreed a programme for Government.  It now proceeds to each of their memberships and that programme for Government sets out an ambitious programme to fight climate change.  It is critical that we tackle this crisis now, before the damage done to Ireland and the planet is irreparable.  There will be a massive retrofit programme and upgrading more than 500,000 houses with better insulation and energy-saving technology.  There will be increased spending on cycleways and walkways, making it easier for children to cycle to school and for many workers, too.  There will be an ambitious capital programme and investment in public transport and renewable energy, while the electrification of the transport system will of course be accelerated.  There will be a major drive to realise the immense potential of Ireland's offshore renewables.<\/p>  <p>  The carbon tax income and the increases that will be forthcoming will be ring-fenced for a just transition and to protect people on lower incomes and in fuel poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The draft programme for Government contains a number of measures which will be very important in supporting a just transition in the midlands.  This will be even more critical given the announcement yesterday that Bord na M&oacute;na has further suspended peat harvesting and further accelerated the decarbonisation of its product and is now bringing forward the commencement of work on the enhanced peatland rehabilitation scheme.  I welcome the commitment by Government on foot of that decision by the board.  Having received legal opinion, the Government brought forward &euro;20 million from within its own funds in order to accelerate that rehabilitation scheme, which has the potential to create an atmosphere whereby those jobs will not be lost immediately or anything like it into a four-year programme.<\/p>  <p>  These measures will play a vital role in implementing the recommendations of the just transition commissioner's report.  We have provided in the programme for Government to place his office on a statutory basis, and given clear commitments to grow the size of the just transition fund.  Work must begin immediately, given yesterday&lsquo;s announcement, to ensure the release of funding for reskilling, amongst the proposals being considered on foot of the recommendations from the just transition commissioner in his report last month.  It is critical that we bring people along with us and that we make the transition to a low carbon economy.  Not only is this morally imperative but I believe that people will be much more on board with the transition if it is just and fair.<\/p>  <p>  Given the commitments in the programme for Government, we cannot be naive to the impacts climate change is already having and will continue to have on the 300 communities studied by the CFRAM report throughout the country.  According to the OPW, some 80% of the properties investigated are at risk of flooding and two thirds of the population within it are at risk of being impacted by such flooding.  These figures will likely increase in the years and decades ahead.  Under the CFRAM programme, projects already completed and in the pipeline should protect 95% of the properties mentioned that are at risk of flooding.<\/p>  <p>  It is critical that this programme for Government, therefore, is passed and that a Government is formed and that funding is provided by the OPW so that it can fully implement the CFRAM programme and continue the work that has gone into producing it in recent years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700049#CCC00300","speaker":"1591"},{"type":"speech","time":1592407500,"counter":208,"content":"<p>In terms of the contribution of the OPW to climate change, obviously much needs to be done.

I ask the Minister to comment on some contributions by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, about a fortnight ago in answering to Deputy Feighan, my constituency colleague, about Sligo Garda station.

Can the Minister confirm, and I hope this is correct, that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, in some way and perhaps inadvertently, misled the D&aacute;il when he said that the Commissioner had decided that this Garda station was now going to be done up <i>in situ<\/i>instead of building a new one?  As I said, the Minister for Justice and Equality confirmed here on 19 December to the then Deputy, Tony McLoughlin, that it was going ahead but that seemed to change when answering to Deputy Feighan in recent weeks.  Can the Minister outline what financial reason underpins this in terms of resources being scarce, &euro;1.35 million being spent on a site and the need clearly established for a new station with Macroom and Clonmel?  What implications does this have, if it is true, for the projects in Clonmel and Macroom going ahead and for the public private partnership?

Glanmire was flooded back in 2012 and after the initial shock that the residents there received, they were delighted that the flood prevention scheme was approved.  The scheme was meant to be completed at this stage and it is running approximately two years behind schedule.  Can the Minister clarify the precise timeline for the completion of that scheme and can he confirm that the funding is still in place for it?  All this time we have been led to believe the file is sitting on the Minister's desk, ready to be signed off and to commence.  I ask for clarity on that.<\/p>  <p>  The Dunkettle interchange is another scheme which is a bit behind schedule.  It is out for retender and the tenders are due to come in this September.  A number of residents have contacted me and they live in the middle of what is to become the new Dunkettle interchange.  They do not live outside it or beside it but bang in the middle of it and approximately ten such houses remain.  They went to the trouble of speaking to a hydrologist and commissioning their own report about concerns they have with flooding.  The hydrologist suggested a number of mitigation measures and I have submitted that report to both Cork County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  As of yet, I have not received a response.  I was hoping I could also submit that to the OPW.  The OPW has a remit to deal with culverts and storm water so I was hoping I could pass the hydrologist's report to the OPW as well today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700050#DDD00200","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1592408100,"counter":211,"content":"<p>I want to raise the issue of the increasingly severe conditions we are seeing year-on-year.

There is a flood relief scheme for Enniscorthy and almost &euro;50 million was put aside by the Minister in last October's budget for same.  The programme was meant to be sent up by Wexford County Council last October for approval by the Minister by December to go to tender this summer.  Unfortunately, for some reason it appears the scheme did not arrive with the Minister until this March and because of that there is a now a further environmental impact assessment, EIA, review as I understand it from Wexford County Council before it can proceed to tender.  I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is also carrying out a tender process for the independent experts who can carry out these new EIA reviews that need to be carried out under a new EU regulation.  Can the Minister give an update on what the timeline is for those independent inspectors for that tender to be carried out?  We are now told that a programme for this flood relief scheme that was to be approved by the Minister last December will take at least another six to 12 months to be signed off on.

The Minister in the Chamber should be in a position to tell us how it manages that, what level of work has been done in recent years, how much money has been spent and, maybe more importantly, how much money will be spent in the future to retrofit Government buildings.

If possible, I ask the Minister to pass that on.  As a Louth county councillor, I met the Minister of State a number of times.  He has done some works and site visits.  At Balmer's Bog, for example, the preliminary works are already about to start.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing specifically with climate change.  It is not that startling to state that we are looking at the possibility, or rather, beyond the possibility, of dealing with the actuality of greater rainfall, greater storms and greater flood risk difficulties.  I am very glad that there is room within the CFRAM and flood protection plans for adaptations.  Deputies have spoken about being parochial.  I am going to be incredibly parochial.  We are talking about 300 communities and 3 million people across the State whose homes are at risk of flooding.  I think everyone is aware that County Louth has a fair number of coastal areas and has suffered from a significant amount of flooding over the years.  We have welcomed the CFRAM proposals.  I will look for an update from the Minister on the specifics.  It is a matter of the timeline and the deliverables.  I accept that the local authority is involved in this, but it is also a question of whether room is allowed, possibly even within the proposed new programme for Government, for what will happen in the future regarding a need to adapt not only the plans but also the costings.  We are talking about Dundalk and what is called Blackrock south.  I think what was envisaged for the area was costed previously at approximately &euro;40.5 million.  Then we are talking about Carlingford-Greenore, which is costed at up to &euro;24 million.  Drogheda is costed at in or around &euro;17 million, combined with the possibility of Baltray.  Then there are question marks over Annagassan and Termonfeckin.  I want to see where they are because they are proposed just on the basis of funding, etc., but with the greater difficulties we have of climate change, we need to ensure that we completely secure these areas and the communities that live in them.  I refer to Dundalk in particular.  I would not like to see my house go underwater.  People in my estate, Bay Estate, and surrounding areas already have difficulties with insurance.  I do not want to get into the ins and outs or rights and wrongs relating to the activities of insurance companies, but this is an issue many people are dealing with across the board.  Could I have an update on the costs and the future-proofing?  I would also like an update on any interaction there has been with Louth County Council.

Like a number of previous speakers, I am familiar with the important work of the OPW on flood relief, particularly from my time as a county councillor in Meath.  I worked on the CFRAM and FEM FRAM programmes in the east Meath and Fingal area up towards Ashbourne.  I commend that work.  In my experience, we had works in Ashbourne, which are ongoing, as a result of flooding in 1986 and 2002, before my time, but when I was a councillor, we had very bad floods there in November 2014 and a flood alleviation scheme as a result.  Like everything, it did not come quickly enough and there was not enough money and so on, but I commend David Keyes from Meath County Council and the officials from the OPW and the Department who worked with local public representatives and local residents to move that project along.  I hope it will meet its completion date.<\/p>  <p>  I have a couple of questions.  The first broadly concerns the role of the OPW, not just in flood relief but also its management of a number of very important sites, including heritage sites, which are vulnerable to climate change.  I spoke to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, during an earlier session about this matter.  What plans does the OPW have regarding heritage sites and the mitigation of the threat of climate change, whether in terms of flooding, extreme weather events or other issues?<\/p> <p> The other point I wanted to raise was the important role of the OPW as a notifiable body in planning.  We have seen the bad aspects of planning in the recent past with houses built on flood plains.  What efforts will be made by the OPW working with local authorities to ensure we do not see those situations again?  My fear is that we will continue to see them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700051#EEE00900","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592409300,"counter":228,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for his questions.

I believe the most significant contribution the OPW makes to the issue that Deputy O'Rourke is raising regarding the inappropriate location for construction of homes is the publication of the maps that show flood risk.

In 2009 one of the most difficult times I recall as a politician was when we had flooding of the River Shannon.  I remember going to businesses and houses and standing up in water.  As a politician I felt helpless.  At the time no one seemed to be in charge of the River Shannon.  It was supposed to be the ESB but most of the local authorities and the OPW looked the other way.<\/p>  <p>  I am glad that in the past ten years we have come a long way in trying to address this serious problem.  We had climate change and lack of management.  I wish to compliment Leitrim County Council, Roscommon County Council and all the workers along with the OPW and the ESB for coming up with better management of a situation that had been embarrassing.  In 2015 we had flooding in Leitrim villages, Carrick-on-Shannon, Roosky and many other places.  The local authorities have done much work on this.<\/p>  <p>  There is considerable onus on local initiatives.  Over the years I have met with various local people who have had an interest in, and knowledge of, the river.  The River Shannon is a complex system.  The people in Roosky blamed the people in Dromad for letting the water go.  The people in Dromad blamed the people in Carrick-on-Shannon for letting the water go.  The people in Carrick-on-Shannon asked for the water to be held in Lough Allen.  I am glad that we have a management system in place working with all the various people.<\/p>  <p>  I have met the two or three Ministers responsible for the OPW when we were in government from 2011 to 2019.  Brian Kenny, Liam Farrell and John Dunne are from Carrick-on-Shannon.  They have come up with constructive solutions.  Under the catchment flood risk assessment and management programme, funding was provided to the local authorities in counties Leitrim and Roscommon to take out trees around Jamestown south of Carrick-on-Shannon.  I have no doubt this helped to alleviate the flooding in Carrick-on-Shannon.  It was really bad at the Cortober end, where there is a huge shopping complex.  I have no doubt that helped.  We took into consideration that funding became available.  The local authority did much work on the Cootehall Road.  We met the Cleaheen and Cootehall residents.  The two local authorities did a good deal of work in raising the road.  It all helped.<\/p>  <p>  We have to deal with the major issue of climate change.  We have been able to manage the rivers so far, but it is like putting a finger in the dyke trying to determine the best solution.  Unless we can manage the Shannon better, we will be in a difficult situation.<\/p>  <p>  There is an issue regarding turloughs.  In my town of Boyle in Roscommon we have Ann and Vincent Brady.  They have an issue regarding turloughs.  They are still not satisfied.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Kevin Boxer Moran, has done great work but this is an outstanding area.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to look at exploring whether we can get funding to address this problem with the turloughs.  I looked at the River Shannon and it seemed to be fine.  Then, the next thing was that we saw a turlough - it was like a lake.  It is an outstanding issue.  I know much good work has been done but this is outstanding and it needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the &euro;5 million that was approved for local authorities for 50 local flood relief schemes.  That certainly helped.  It brings the committed investment to &euro;39 million for over 800 local authority flood relief projects throughout the country.<\/p>  <p>  We are talking about CFRAM and people who are for and against the CFRAM programme.  In Carrick-on-Shannon it was proposed to have a glass wall of 1.5 m.<\/p>  <p>  Ironically, I did not realise the Minister was due to speak in the House today.  Last Monday, I had the local engineer out where the Shannon comes up to a house in Cortober.  We are trying to get a bank built.  I wish to thank the local engineer, Michael Conlon, and all the staff there for the work they have done.  At the toughest of times we have seen the best of the businesses, residents and local authority staff.  I could not thank them highly enough.  They were out at all times.  It is great to see that at the toughest of times local authority members are out working trying to resolve the problems.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy MacSharry rightly raised the Garda station.  I understand this is about climate change but the situation needs to be addressed.  Last December a parliamentary questions was answered by the Minister for Justice and Equality to the effect that a new Garda station was definitely going ahead in Sligo.  The Garda Commissioner has seemingly vetoed that political decision, which is unusual.  The rank and file garda&iacute; in Sligo Garda station are disillusioned because promises were made by Garda management and there were political decisions.  They feel seriously let down.  They believe it is unusual that the Garda Commissioner would veto a decision by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I would like to get answers to that because I tabled a parliamentary question two weeks ago, when the Garda station was going ahead.  The first I heard of this was when the parliamentary question stated that the stations in Clonmel and Macroom were going ahead while Sligo was not.<\/p> <p>Rank and file garda&iacute; in Sligo deserve better.  As the Minister knows from launching the 2040 development plan, it is a regional town.  The people of the north west deserve better.<\/p> <p> A value for money report needs to be done.  If a site is bought for &euro;1.4 million in order to locate a new state-of-the-art Garda station for the brave men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when the Garda is also spending millions of euro on a barracks that neither I nor the Garda believes is fit for purpose, there must be a value for money report.  Whoever is in government, I will fight to ensure we get that new station.  It was promised.<\/p> <p> Before I go any further, I want to get answers to my questions from the Garda Commissioner or the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I look forward to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700052#FFF00500","speaker":"1608","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592409900,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his various questions.

My understanding, though, is that there has been a definite increase in the cost of paying out for flooding across the country as the frequency and severity of those floods have increased over time.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of what we will do to support homes and businesses that are unable to get insurance, the main work is happening at local authority level in the form of putting in place flood relief measures.  Local authorities are working with insurance companies to get that work recognised as reducing the risk of flooding.  The Deputy will be familiar with this from our own constituency.  For example, the OPW has done work in the East Wall and North Strand areas.  While it has not brought back the insurance that our constituents had previously, more of them are now able to access insurance than could do so in the aftermath of the flooding that happened a number of years ago.  While the premia are still higher than they would want and I would hope, it is positive that the insurance sector has recognised particular projects in making insurance cover available.  I hope that as work on, for example, the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, project continues across the country, it will be recognised by more insurers in the insurance cover they are willing to make available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700053#GGG00500","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1592409900,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  He mentioned our constituency.  The transition statement identifies that the most profound health impacts of climate change will arise from severe weather events, ultraviolet radiation and poor air quality.  My colleague, Deputy Costello, gathered some data on schools at the start of the year.  They showed that additional traffic doubles the level of nitrous oxide, NOx, during the school term.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, says that Dublin city centre's air quality in 2019 was likely to have breached EU and WHO guidelines and that this was due largely to our reliance on fossil fuel motor vehicles for transport.  The EPA's report included advice from the WHO suggesting that we lift young children above the level of vehicle exhausts.  I suggest that reducing car traffic would be a more practical option than carrying children around on our backs.<\/p>  <p>  In spite of this, the OPW seems to have little inclination to do anything about car traffic through or on its properties.  A case in point is the Phoenix Park.  During the shutdown, we had a window onto what the park should look like - a natural haven.  In a short space of time, my colleague on Dublin City Council, Mr. Michael Pidgeon, garnered more than 7,000 signatures for a petition calling for the park to be closed to through traffic.  Despite this, the OPW's first reaction was to propose reopening the gates to traffic.  As a result of that decision, we have seen in the past few days the main avenue become gridlocked with traffic and the associated NOx emissions.

Upgrading our homes, offices and public buildings to ensure that they use less energy will be one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions and limit climate change.  The OPW, with its property portfolio of approximately 2,500 buildings, including more than 200 large Government and State agency buildings, must lead the way in this regard.  While it is important that energy-efficient design be incorporated into all public sector projects from the early design stage onwards, we should also ensure that we upgrade and reuse existing public buildings in preference to new-build construction where possible.  Through OPW refurbishment projects, the Government can ensure that it plays a consistent and exemplary role in driving the energy efficiency agenda.<\/p>  <p>  Under action 62 of Climate Action Plan 2019, the OPW was to take the lead in examining how and when fossil fuel heating systems could be phased out of public buildings, including disallowing the installation of any new fossil fuel heating systems.

This proposal was met with a great deal of opposition from the general public and, to its credit, the OPW took much of that opposition on board.  However, the OPW should be taking the lead in protecting biodiversity as part of its climate targets as well as reducing emissions from its built heritage properties.

It understandably had a clear focus on flooding and it must be acknowledged that there has been a great deal of work done in that area in recent years.  I commend, in particular, the outgoing Minster of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, on his work.  He brought with him to the role a personal credibility on the issue which he practised as Minister of State.  We have seen him in some very well-circulated media photographs up to his waist in floodwater but he always backed up those kinds of high-profile media photographs with actual policy and action and he was always very accessible to Deputies during the last D&aacute;il.  I commend him and his work very highly.<\/p>  <p>  My first question relates to the role of afforestation and strong afforestation schemes in flood mitigation measures.  What is the current thinking in the OPW in this regard?  Every community in the country can point to a location, be it a very small stream or a system as large and complex as the River Shannon, where there has been increased flooding and damage in recent years.  What is constantly put forward as a solution is a strong afforestation scheme on banks to absorb soakage.  I am very interested in the Minister's answer to this question.<\/p>  <p>  Where I am a bit disappointed in the Minister's statement is in the area of coastal erosion and protections.  We have 7,500 km or thereabouts of coastline and the vast majority of that coastline is unprotected.  The eastern seaboard in particular is going through a long-term and continual recession and attack.  This is part of the climate emergency, with shifting sea trends, melting polar ice caps and fluctuating temperatures.  All of that is having an impact on our sea flows and tides.  Where coastlines are vulnerable is where the most damage is being done.<\/p>  <p>  One of those areas of severe vulnerability is the Donabate-Portrane Peninsula, which is between the Rogerstown Estuary to the north and the Broadmeadow Estuary to the south.  Within the Donabate-Portrane Peninsula is the Burrow in Portrane, which is a peninsula on a peninsula.  The damage there has been well documented down through the years but it has seen untold damage over the past seven to eight years.  I credit the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, who visited the site at the invitation of my predecessor, former Deputy Brendan Ryan, and the outgoing Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, who visited a couple of years ago, for getting work done and getting Fingal County Council to start providing, at first, short-term measures and then a plan for long-term solutions.  Unfortunately, that is not happening in the way it needs to happen.<\/p>  <p>  What are in place at the Burrow in Portrane are what are called seabees, which are large hexagonal concrete structures designed to protect the properties and habitat there.  They have been placed along a middle stretch of the beach but do not extend down to the south end where there are public toilets that are 2 ft away from falling into the sea.  Something this pandemic has brought about is a discussion on how much we need public toilet facilities throughout the country.  They were taken away in the 1970s and 1980s and we need them back.  In the case of a popular amenity like the beach at Portrane, if that public toilet becomes further compromised and falls into the sea, it will take an extremely long time to replace it.  Beside the public toilets is a premises containing a thriving business, Piper's takeaway, in which two families, including four children, are living.  Their property is under massive stress.  There is a green space and an access way to the beach, which are also under imminent threat.  An extension of the seabees 100 yd south to protect this area is urgently needed.<\/p>  <p>  North of where the seabees are currently located, we need further protection for the properties on Beach Lane.  The residents there have always been two or three steps ahead of the OPW, the council and the public representatives on this issue.  They can see what is happening with their own eyes.  As I said, two Ministers of State have visited the location and I am now extending an invitation to the incoming Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW to visit the site at his or her earliest convenience.  I ask the Minister to leave that request on the desk for whomever the new Minister of State will be.  We have already seen one house fall into the sea and we cannot see any more.  We cannot let the good work that has been done be totally undermined by the fact that it has not been done completely.  These areas are under imminent threat.<\/p>  <p>  The Burrow is a special area of conservation but the very habitats that are supposed to be conserved are under threat.  The little tern project is under way there, which requires a shingle beach to be protected as the little terns nest on it and their eggs are camouflaged in the shingles.  If the erosion and secretion of sand continues on the beach, all of that will be taken away.  The dunes that have already evaporated have taken away habitat for other birds and butterflies, damaging biodiversity in the location.  Coastal erosion is not the only problem.  In addition, the whole peninsula is prone to flooding.  We have areas such as Corballis, which is on the Broadmeadow Estuary side of the peninsula, where families have been blocked in by regular flooding.<\/p> <p>It is an area of extreme vulnerability.  I ask that the incoming Minister and his or her Department increase their focus on it.<\/p> <p> The Minister has not mentioned this but I would like it to be clear that we cannot countenance a policy of managed retreat when it comes to coastal erosion.  We do have in our power the ability to provide protections and defences against this onslaught.  We cannot continue to lose more of our land to the seasons.  The OPW needs to be more proactive in terms of working with the local authorities.  It needs to push the local authorities further and to work shoulder-to-shoulder with them.  The OPW has provided funding but it needs to take a more active role in the delivery of these projects.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cowen mentioned the draft programme for Government and said that it is ambitious.  I am not here to take a pop at any draft programme.  It is a draft and it has not been agreed yet but the reference in it to progressing a national policy on coastal erosion and flooding having regard to climate change needs to be bolstered and strengthened.  Communities throughout the country need to see stronger commitments in regard to coastal erosion.<\/p> <p> In March of this year a memo was brought to Cabinet in regard to a high level interdepartmental group on the management of coastal change, which is jointly chaired by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the OPW.  The work of the group was initially to scope out over a six month period an approach to the development of a integrated whole-of-government coastal strategy.  What is the status of that work?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700054#HHH00600","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592411100,"counter":246,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his gracious comments regarding the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, which were echoed by a number of other Deputies this afternoon.

Much of the progress we are discussing today is due to his efforts.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding coastal erosion in Donabate and Portrane, the OPW has and is engaging intensively with Fingal County Council on that issue.

The document highlights that there will be an increase in extreme weather events resulting in an increased risk of flooding.  Flooding has caused irreparable damage to communities and businesses in areas, including west Cork.  We desperately need a proactive, whole-of-government and sustainable response.<\/p><p>To deal properly with flooding we must consider the broader landscape.  As well as taking into consideration our emissions and climate action commitments, we need to take action on planning, afforestation, piecemeal interventions and inadequate supports that have made communities more vulnerable.  Too often, poor planning combined with inaction over years has resulted in communities flooding and then accepting highly-invasive and expensive infrastructure when simple and more robust measures combined with good planning could have avoided and alleviated flooding.<\/p><p>Flood management plans and a culture in the OPW indicate a preference for flood containment measures, which is hard engineering works that significantly impact on the natural and cultural landscape, such as massive permanent walls and embankments.  Management plans such as the one for the Bandon-Ilen river basin in west Cork include environmental considerations but allow significant damage to biodiversity and fisheries.  No reference is made to the larger environmental impacts such as the emissions associated with<b><\/b>consistently building massive concrete walls.<\/p><p>There is an insufficient use of a watershed approach which integrates flood protection, stream and wetland habitat restorations and water quality improvements.  Instead of looking at flooding in a piecemeal fashion we should be addressing it on a watershed scale.  Cork&rsquo;s River Bride in Blackpool is a clear example.  Years of minor schemes and developments, including building on flood plains, has contributed to recent flooding and the only solution offered is to culvert, which will destroy a rich wildlife corridor flowing through the city.<\/p><p>We should be planting protection forestry along rivers to preserve water quality and assist in flood management.  We need to protect and restore our wetlands as natural defences for fluvial and coastal flooding.  Only this week I received calls about damage being done to the Garrylucas wetlands near Kinsale.  Retention or storage upstream, through<b><\/b>attenuation and controlled flooding of a natural flood plain, as well as sustainable urban drainage systems, are proven methods of addressing flooding with less of an impact on landscapes and towns.  In flood management plans and schemes, the flood containments and increasing-the-flow-capacity of a river are prioritised over small-scale, nature based measures.  We should be working with the landscape, using and enhancing natural defences, not working against it.<\/p><p>How committed is the Minister and the OPW to using soft engineering measures such as retention or storage upstream, instead of flood containment options and can the Minister cite examples of where schemes have predominantly used retention-storage upstream over flood containment?<\/p><p>As an activist in local campaigns and a former county councillor, one of the most frustrating things has been the disregard for the opinions of local communities.  Local and State authorities just steam-roll through decisions, leaving people no option but to fundraise large amounts of money to appeal these decisions in court.  Surely, it should be the other way around.  The burden of responsibility should be on central and local government to value and use local knowledge.  If we want local democracy we need to foster local participation and not just consultations that can be ignored but real community-led planning.  We need to listen to communities to develop workable solutions based on knowledge of the land and the cultural and natural heritage.<\/p><p>Research from UCC&rsquo;s Dr. Alexandra Revez has highlighted the limited nature of community participation in flooding management processes and the need for greater consideration of social justice and environmental issues.  In recent times there has been concern across west Cork about excessive works which irreparably damage natural spaces and tourism amenities.  However, official insistence and desperation among communities have forced these schemes through.  This situation is now playing out in Cork city.  There is heavy opposition from community and businesses to the flood relief scheme and there is little sign of their input being taken into consideration.  The OPW and other State bodies should have the highest standards and best practices for public involvement.  The OPW should empower communities and work with them.  Will the Minister re-evaluate our flood management systems to ensure local communities are included in a much more substantial way?<\/p><p>The annual transition statement makes reference to a coherent whole-of-government approach in addressing flooding but developments on flood plains, inappropriate afforestation and the loss of urban green spaces show this is not the reality.  A response from the State requires action on planning, tackling insurance companies that are not providing adequate cover for whole communities and support for families and businesses who are terrified when flooding is forecasted.  Insurance, in particular, is an ongoing issue that needs to be addressed.  Flood relief schemes are only one part of the solution.  In west Cork, towns such as Bandon, Skibbereen and Schull need comprehensive responses that address their needs not higher walls.  What assurances can the Minister give that there will be a whole-of-government approach, including robust planning policies and insurance reform?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700055#JJJ00500","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1592411100,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.

Both of those objectives also have public support.  I know from engaging with the OPW that it wants to ensure we make more use of our natural habitat and assets in reducing flooding risk, but there are still flooding risks that require engineering and construction.  The projects the Deputy has highlighted are examples of that.  The OPW believes the engineering and construction work it has proposed is proportionate and needed.<\/p> <p> I understand that a significant amount of work has now gone into the Bandon flood relief scheme.

I accept that he may not have the same level of detailed knowledge as the Aire St&aacute;it on this matter.  If he cannot answer a question I would be happy for him to come back to me on it.  One issue I know is close to the Minister's heart and which we spent many a long hour in rooms together discussing is the voluntary home relocation scheme.  I thank the Minister for his help in getting that scheme established.  After the flooding we saw last winter, in the last few months I have come across three families which had been flooded previously in 2015-16.  In one case, the local authority was unaware that the family had previously been flooded.  The other two families had hoped that the mitigation measures on the River Shannon would address their need to relocate, but they have not.  That scheme has now been closed and it would be helpful if that could be revisited and a small bit of flexibility granted for some of those families that were caught out in 2015-16.<\/p>  <p>  When the Minister and I discussed the voluntary home relocation scheme we also looked at two other issues.  One was the introduction of an individual home protection scheme where individual home protections would be far more successful than people having to actually move.  There were a number of pilots for that but the scheme has not yet got off the ground.  I ask the Minister to provide me with an update on it.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue we discussed was the voluntary farmyard relocation scheme, which was also committed to at the time.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was to look into it and my fear is that he is still looking into it.  When I questioned him on it this time last year, he said the Department was still considering it.  We have had two 100-year floods within the catchment area of the River Shannon, in 2009-10 and 2015-16, and there was very severe flooding again last winter.  A number of farmyards that are vulnerable to flooding need to be protected or relocated.  I ask the Minister to ensure that particular scheme is expedited.<\/p>  <p>  I also ask the Minister to update the House on the progress of a number of active schemes.  As he knows, &euro;8.6 million has now been committed to a flood relief scheme for the town of Ballinasloe.  Consultants have been appointed to look at flood defence walls and embankments, at increasing the flow capacity of the east bridge in the town, at constructing two lock gates on the canal and at the maintenance of the channel.  I ask the Minister to update me on where that scheme is at.  I also seek an update on the scheme in Athlone, particularly for the Bogginfin area just north of the town where flood relief measures are to be introduced.  Consultants have been appointed but there does not seem to be any progress on it.  Similarly, when will consultants be appointed for the flood relief scheme in Roscommon town?  I ask the Minister to update me on some of those issues if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700056#KKK00600","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1592411700,"counter":257,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his various questions.  As he will be aware, the first public consultation for the Ballinasloe flood relief scheme took place in March and it is hoped to complete the feasibility study for this project and bring the scheme to public exhibition in the third quarter of next year.  Subject to the consent process under the Arterial Drainage Acts, it is currently estimated that construction will begin in early 2023 and it is anticipated that the work will take around two years to complete.<\/p> <p>That is where that project stands.<\/p> <p> On the Roscommon flood relief scheme to which the Deputy referred, the OPW and Roscommon County Council have met recently to discuss the status of that project and the OPW has informed me that it is looking to progress it at the earliest opportunity.  I will ask the OPW to revert to the Deputy with some specific timings on that.<\/p> <p> On the different schemes to which the Deputy referred, I remember all of the discussions we had, including in respect of the relocation scheme and the need to move particular properties.  A number of homeowners availed of the scheme, which is why it was set up.  I will follow up on the reason for its closure because I recall the debates the Deputy and I had.  He correctly stated that it is more cost-effective and appropriate to ask and encourage a small number of families to move rather than putting a large amount of investment into schemes that would be very expensive, particularly in view of the number of homes that would be protected.<\/p> <p> The Deputy also referred to minor works.  I think we are talking about the same thing but if we are not, I know he will tell me so.  I refer to the minor flood mitigation work programme.  I understand that for 2019 alone, &euro;5 million in funding was made available to local authorities for that programme and that this led to 50 different flood relief schemes being put in place.

The Minister's officials can revert to me on individual home protection schemes and the farmyard relocation scheme, neither of which has got off the ground as yet.<\/p>  <p>  I want to move on to a couple of other matters.  The first is the fact that a number of communities are marooned during severe flooding because they have no road access in and out of their areas.  That can last for a number of weeks or even months, as happened in C&oacute;is Abhainn in south Roscommon, and people can be impacted by turloughs where the water can be lying on a road for a considerable period.  There has been engagement between the OPW and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding a number of individual roads in Roscommon, Westmeath, Galway, Cavan and Sligo in order to provide a specific scheme to protect and secure access for those communities.  The Minister might provide an update on that matter.  When I entered office, I authorised Geological Survey Ireland to work with the OPW on a groundwater and turlough flood monitoring programme in Roscommon, Galway and Longford.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to a comment by the chairperson of the OPW, Maurice Buckley, who came before a committee in 2018 and stated that the projected wetter winters, particularly in the west of Ireland, could give rise to increased groundwater flooding associated with turloughs.  We have a particular problems with turloughs called Lough Funshinagh in south Roscommon and Correal outside Roscommon town that have threatened and flooded homes in the past.  There were serious problems in these areas last winter.  We have solutions for the turlough in Castleplunket, but we have to work up solutions for the turloughs in Bushfield and Lisserdrea outside Boyle in Roscommon.  In tandem with that, we need to have an effective cost-benefit analysis for turloughs because the water remains for a considerable period and the current cost-benefit analysis does not reflect that.  Homes are marooned and flooded and land is flooded for months and, in the case of Lough Funshinagh in south Roscommon, years.<\/p>  <p>  I asked the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, about the cost-benefit analysis relating to turloughs to which the Government is committed and last month he told me that nothing has yet been done.

He referred to flooding.  There has been a lot of talk over the years that climate change is the cause of rivers flooding and that it will create more havoc.  I do not agree.  Our rivers are flooding because they are not being cleared.  As the Minister knows, farmers cannot clear rivers due to the fact they will lose their farm payments because of cross-compliance.  The River Flesk is one such example in Kerry.  I am very grateful to the Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran, who came when I asked him to visit Glenflesk and Castleisland.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked him to visit other places and he met us.  As a result, we got money to clear part of the Flesk.  Until then, houses were being flooded.  The N22, a national primary road, was flooded several times in 2015 and 2016.  Since the river was cleared last year and despite there being several floods, no roads or houses were flooded.<\/p>  <p>  Consultants said that clearing the river would only make a difference of a few millimetres.  The fact is that the river was lowered by metres.  The road is not in jeopardy and the emergency services can go back and forth to hospitals in Cork and Tralee.  The national primary route into Kerry is no longer flooded.  I have to thank the Minister of State for agreeing to and giving us the funding to clear the river.  Following several years of deputations by me, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae and the residents of the entire Flesk area to Kerry County Council, that was the result.  The remainder of the Flesk needs to be cleared.  The Laune between Killarney to Killorglin badly needs to be cleared.  The Lake Hotel was flooded and the owner had to pay millions to repair it.  I ask the Minister not to allow that to happen again.  The main river in Castleisland was cleared out 60 years ago and it was grand until a few years ago.  It needs to be cleared again.  However, CFRAM has suggested spending millions on building a flood plain near the town to hold water.  The Brogeen, Glashoreag, Gweestin and other rivers need to be cleared.<\/p>  <p>  When we are talking about rivers, we must talk about pollution.  There is a lot of talk about the environment.  People think that I do not appreciate the environment; I certainly do.<\/p> <p>I do not subscribe to this thing of climate change, but I sincerely ask this.  There is no mention that I can see in the programme for Government of sewage treatment plants that need to be built where there are none in places like Kilcummin, Currow and Scartaglen.  Places like Castleisland have been waiting for 40 years for an extension to the treatment plant and we are talking about pollution there during wet weather.  They have to clean out the septic tanks fortnightly or monthly when there is wet weather in Castleisland.  That has been going on for 40 years.<\/p> <p> Tobin Consulting has done CFRAM reports in places like Glenflesk and applicants are being denied planning permission.  It is unfair because they are citing that a particular field could be flooded in 100 years or 1,000 years.  The people who want to build houses for themselves will be long gone before ever a flood will come again, but if the river is kept cleared it will not flood.  That is what I want to drive home to the Minister.<\/p> <p> I am very disappointed with the programme for Government - the Green Party's programme for Government.  Planning permission for people in rural areas is to be denied except in towns or villages where there is public transport.  We do not have public transport like people in cities have.  The quadrupling of the carbon tax to &euro;100 per tonne will have a massive adverse effect on people in rural areas who do not have the same options for transport or heating as those in urban areas.<\/p> <p> We are hearing a lot about offshore renewable energy.  Why does the Government not just start with the easy things such as solar panels?  Many farmers in Kerry have been granted planning permission for solar panels, but there is no scheme to pay them for their electricity at present.  They have been waiting for three or four years for some planning guidelines to come that are being promised day after day but have not come.  They are also waiting for the scheme to pay them for the energy that they would supply.<\/p> <p> There is a lot of talk about carbon and the people are scared of their lives about what will happen to them in the next number of years if this Government goes ahead.  They are absolutely terrified.  People need their cars and they need surety.  They need something that is affordable and reliable.  When we reach such time as the electric cars prove themselves, then people will buy them and will give them a fair chance.  However, it is wrong to be forcing people down the road that they cannot drive anything except electric cars.  That is the wrong way to go about it.<\/p> <p> They are talking about heating and stopping people from cutting turf.  We cut turf every year and it is not an easy job.  People have to cut it, turn it, foot it, stook it, bring it home, bring it into the fire and then take out the ashes.  Many people are proud to do that, and they cannot afford anything else.  While they are able to do it, they will do it.  One elderly man said to me the other day, \"I suppose I won't be able to do it for much longer.  I'll have to get oil or something else.\"  They are proud to do that and that is all they can afford.  It is wrong to stop people from doing such things.  Maybe the next generation or the generation after will not look at a bog or go there.  Maybe there will be different ways at that time.  It is wrong to be forcing things on people and it is wrong the way this Green programme for Government is being put out there.  People are terrified of it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Donohoe is a Minister in the present Government, and it is prophesied that he will be a Minister in the next Government as well.  It came out this morning that publicans can only allow a person to stay in a pub for 90 minutes.  How can publicans be reasonably asked to monitor that?  A fellow comes in for a pint or whatever and maybe he goes out smoking or something and there are a few around.  It is not possible for someone inside in the bar to keep tabs on every fellow.  After 29 June he is supposed to ask for a meal, but he will come in and sit down and the publican will show him the menu.  He may say that someone else is supposed to come and join him.  While he is waiting, he will have the pint and maybe have a second pint drunk before the second person comes.  How are publicans and restaurants supposed to manage that?<\/p> <p> I do not have enough time, but people out there are very suspicious that there is no costing for the programme for Government.  The Minister has been dealing with finance for the past four years.  He cannot sell something to the people without giving the figures and facts showing where the money will come from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700057#LLL00400","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1592412900,"counter":263,"content":"<p>Unfortunately, the time has expired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700058#MMM00200","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1592412900,"counter":264,"content":"<p>If the Minister sends me an answer in writing, I would be very grateful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700058#MMM00300","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1592412900,"counter":265,"content":"<p>T&aacute; m&eacute; ag roinnt mo chuid ama.

Flooding is completely related to climate change, bad planning and to a lot of other factors.  One of the factors is climate change and resulting rise in our water levels.  We then go to biodiversity.  I have gone from Billy to Jack with regard to a biodiversity officer in Galway city.  Given the Minister's role in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is he aware there is a moratorium in Galway city - I have the email confirming this - and that it cannot employ a biodiversity officer?  Is that email from the Minister's Department or from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, or has Galway City Council imposed a moratorium and cannot employ a biodiversity officer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700059#NNN00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1592413500,"counter":274,"content":"<p>I am not aware of the status of that post.

He has three Deputies from the same constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal, namely, Deputies MacSharry, Feighan and myself, all raising the same issue, which is the promise of the new Garda station in Sligo.  I will not labour it as I have heard the Minister's responses.  I was very pleased to hear the Minister refer to it as a very important policing and Garda station requirement.  I must add, however, that there is extreme disappointment among the public in Sligo and especially among the garda&iacute; at the waste of money, at a site left idle, at the effective downgrading Sligo as a policing location and crucially, for those who work there, at a building that is not fit for purpose.  There is talk of upgrading it.  I do not know if the Minister knows Sligo Garda station, but I do.  One would freeze there in the winter.  I want to lay down a marker.  Before there is any talk of upgrading that building, which is what I believe is proposed, there needs to be a full assessment of a full retrofit.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government for ten times the amount of retrofitting.  I am not an engineer but I can put a small bet that the cost of a full retrofit on Sligo Garda station would probably be greater than the cost of any new build.  I want the Minister to consider that a new build would be the best solution and the value for money solution.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Feighan raised the issue of flooding on the Shannon.  Earlier this year my D&aacute;il colleagues were in Carrick-on-Shannon several times watching water rise, businesses being flooded and land being flooded.  I have been on the Sligo-Dublin train several times and have looked gingerly out the window as water has lapped at the very edge of the train tracks.  They were pumping in Carrick-on-Shannon but the problem is that because of the typography and the levels there was nowhere for the water to go.  Water and walls just will not work in Carrick-on-Shannon.  The water will seep under any wall.  I know there are no simple solutions but these flood risks can be alleviated or at least mitigated by dealing with some of the pinch points on the Shannon.<\/p>  <p>  In 1883 a weir and a lock were built in Jamestown which even at that time were not built according to plan.  To this day, that causes a problem when the river is in flood.  Trees have fallen in and there is silting.  The Minister does not know the area but not far away at Knockvicar there is a weir three times as long.  This gives the Minister some idea of the issues they face.<\/p>  <p>  The bottom line is that the Shannon is a piece of infrastructure to which nothing has been done since the foundation of the State.  Somebody remarked to me that not a teaspoon of water has been taken out but millions of tonnes of silt and peat have been deposited.  The flow can be speeded up at Jamestown.  When people hear this, they throw their hands up in horror and say \"What about further down the river?\".  The flow at Jamestown is 140 cu. m per second, in Athlone, it is 500 cu. m and at Parteen, it is 800 cu. m.  I put it to the Minister that there is flexibility there to do that.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to look at the water levels in Lough Allen.  There are solutions and at the beginning of this year people in Carrick-on-Shannon expected that some of those solutions would be put in place.  It has not happened.  What can be done?<\/p>  <p>  Flooding can never be gotten rid of but we can mitigate the risks.  If those risks can be mitigated using some of the measures I mentioned and perhaps others, although forgetting about the building of walls in Carrick-on-Shannon, then I ask the Minister to consider them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020061700059#NNN00700","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1592413500,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Harkin.
