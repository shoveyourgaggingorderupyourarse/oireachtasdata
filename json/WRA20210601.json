Data centres are part of the core infrastructure of the digital economy by enabling inter alia data storage,\u00a0banking and disaster recovery services. They have become increasingly important in the context of remote working during the Covid 19 pandemic and also support high-quality jobs. The Statement also noted that data centres pose considerable challenges to the future planning and operation of Ireland&rsquo;s power system. <\/p>  <p>  In 2020, data centres represented approximately 11% of the total electricity used in Ireland. EirGrid, in their Generation Capacity Statement 2020-2029, project that demand from data centres could account for 27% of all demand by 2029 which is significant. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to developing efficiency standards for equipment and processes, particularly those set to grow rapidly, such as data centres. The ICT sector needs to undergo its own green transformation. In addition, EirGrid recently launched a public consultation on 'Shaping our Electricity Future'. The aim is to make the electricity grid stronger and more flexible so that it can carry significantly more renewable generation as well as meet increasing demand from high volume energy users such as data centres. This may include potential geographic restrictions or incentives of large demand customers closer to the generation of power, potentially giving a more regional balance of locations. A consultation on this strategy is open until 14\u00a0June\u00a0and there has been detailed stakeholder engagement on it.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems. It is planned that the review will be completed by the end of 2021. The outcome of the review may inform policy in order to meet future demand from data centres. <\/p>  <p>Ireland has significant ambitions to ensure that at least 70% of our electricity demand will be met by renewable sources by 2030. This will help supply the growing demand from data centres. In addition, the large multinationals with data centres in Ireland have committed to a global target of being 100%\u00a0powered by renewable energy by 2025 with some\u00a0committing to 24\/7 renewable energy supply.\u00a0Under the 2019 Climate Action Plan\u00a0a Corporate Power Purchase Advisory Group was established to develop options for realising\u00a0a\u00a0target of 15% of demand\u00a0to be met from CPPAs by 2030.\u00a0The SEAI launched a\u00a0public consultation on the report which closed on 14 April 2021.

My Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout with the aim\u00a0of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the\u00a0network build\u00a0plan. Minister Ryan has recently written to National Broadband Ireland seeking to put the acceleration\u00a0of the programme on a contractual footing. Any change to the contract will require detailed technical, commercial and financial analysis by both parties. <\/p><p>NBI has established a dedicated team to investigate the potential for acceleration of the fibre network rollout from its current contracted schedule of seven years. Substantial work has been completed by this team to date including productive engagement with current build partners. It is premature at this point to speculate as to how many premises may benefit from this potential change, but I can\u00a0say that it will be those premises currently scheduled for the latter end of the rollout that are the focus of the analysis.<\/p><p>While significant progress has been made by NBI over the last year, in challenging circumstances, the pandemic has caused delays to elements of the programme. A remedial plan to mitigate these delays has been agreed and it is in this context that the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being explored. I expect to receive a detailed assessment from my officials by the Autumn and will then bring an update to Government on this matter. <\/p><p>Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network.

These targets cover emissions from sectors outside of the EU Emissions Trading System, including agriculture, transport, buildings and waste. For the year 2020, the target set for Ireland was that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. The 2020 greenhouse gas emissions estimates report, published by the EPA in January 2021, indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be 8% below 2005 levels by 2020. According to this report, Ireland will cumulatively exceed the carbon budget implied by our ESD targets by 11-12Mt and will need to avail of flexibilities in order to comply with our obligations. Pre-COVID19 estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.<\/p><p>Looking forward, the Programme for Government commits to an annual average 7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade), while our current 2030 EU target is a 30% emissions reduction by 2030. The European Commission will publish their &ldquo;Fit for 55&rdquo; package this July, which is expected to propose higher EU targets for all Member States, including Ireland,\u00a0in line with\u00a0the new EU ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. <\/p><p>While Irish agriculture has a positive international reputation in terms of producing high quality, sustainable produce, emissions from the agri-food sector have continued to increase.

Pre-Covid estimates of the additional costs of purchasing carbon credits for compliance with these targets were in the region of &euro;6 million to &euro;13 million, depending on the price and final quantity of allowances required.<\/p>  <p>  As a follow up to the ESD, the EU Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sets binding emission reduction targets for Member States for the period 2021-2030. The final agreement sets Ireland a target of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. It is important to recognise that this target will be amended following the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to increase ambition from its existing EU wide 2030 target of 40% reduction to at least 55%, compared to 1990 levels. Legislative proposals to implement the new EU 2030 target will be presented by July this year, and additional effort will be asked of all Member States, including Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Climate Action, I will lead on delivering this ambition, which will more than halve our carbon emissions over the course of the decade. With the increased scale and depth of this ambition, new strategies will be needed to sustain a reduction trajectory that will increase over time. I am working\u00a0with colleagues across Government to develop a new Climate Action Plan, with additional initiatives in every sector to bring about the significant change needed to transform our society. The Climate Action Plan will require annual revisions to address the need for intensive and regular monitoring and updating of policy actions to ensure we remain on track and within our emission limits, and will act as a further review mechanism and opportunity to adjust and refocus actions,\u00a0as required.<\/p>  <p>  In line with EU ambition, Ireland has committed to achieve an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030, and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. This objective will be set in law by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021, which was published on 23 March 2021. The Bill will support Ireland&rsquo;s transition to net zero and achieve a climate neutral economy by no later than 2050. It will establish a legally binding framework with clear targets and commitments set in law, and ensure the necessary structures and processes are embedded on a statutory basis to ensure we achieve our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100064#WRF06500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Environmental Policy","counter":307,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100064#WRF06600"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[29800\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100064#WRF06700","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the main areas of environmental protection requirements deemed at present to be urgent; the action to date in hand or proposed to deal with any such issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":309,"content":"<p>In November 2020, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its seventh State of the Environment report.\u00a0 These reports are important milestones for Ireland, as they provide a snapshot of the environment at a particular point, as well as showing trends and changes in the environment over time.

Each new version of the Strategy\u00a0is also likely to\u00a0be supplemented by additional\u00a0thematic analyses of specific sectors and\/or activities, such as the scope for embedding circular practices within resource intensive sectors, or the potential for digital services and novel manufacturing techniques to &lsquo;design-out&rsquo; waste.It is anticipated that the Strategy will be updated in full every 18 months to 2 years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100065#WRG03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Energy Policy","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100065#WRG03100"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[29853\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100065#WRG03200","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the introduction of export tariffs for the export of solar energy to the national grid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>The Programme for Government commits to prioritising the development of micro-generation of electricity primarily for self-consumption.

I welcomed\u00a0the announcement of increased thresholds under the existing Cycle to Work Scheme as part of the 2020 July Stimulus package, as well as the expansion of the scheme to electric bikes. The changes to the Scheme are in line with the commitment made in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  The use of e-bikes is proving to be an increasingly popular method of travel, whether for commuting or leisure purposes, and is encouraging more people to choose to cycle. Bearing this in mind, and referencing the commitment by the Government to increase funding to active travel, all potential incentives to potential purchasers of bikes and e-bikes will be taken into consideration moving forward.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to widening the eligibility of the Bike to Work Scheme and my Department, in cooperation with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform will be examining ways in which to do this so that bikes and e-bikes are available and affordable to as many of our citizens as possible. <\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to recently take an initial step towards this with the launch of the Pilot Bike and e-Bike Upcycling Initiative in partnership with the Department of Rural and Community Development (DRCD). This\u00a0 three-year pilot scheme will see\u00a0high quality up-cycled bicycles and e-bikes provided at a lower cost to those on low incomes and\/or those who are most marginalised and disadvantaged. My Department will provide &euro;1 million per annum towards this initiative for its duration, while Pobal will administer the scheme through DRCD's Community Services Programme. The deadline for applications was 28th May 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may also be aware that my Department is in the process of preparing a new Sustainable Mobility Policy following public consultation last year. This new policy framework will provide a strategic backdrop to the increased investment planned by this Government across the\u00a0sustainable\u00a0mobility programme, including active travel, and I look forward to the completion of this important work in 2021.

Any surpluses or deficits in the REF are carried forward and allowed for in setting future levy amounts. <\/p><p>The annual Health Insurance (Amendment) Act sets out the risk equalisation credits and Stamp Duty levy applicable for the following 12 month (1 April to 31 March) period. The level of Stamp Duty to be applied to advanced and non-advanced products for adults and children is then calculated on that basis by the Health Insurance Authority (HIA), and is also provided for in that Act.<\/p><p>For example, in November 2020 the Minister for Health accepted the HIA's recommendation to leave the levy unchanged for the coming 12 month period, i.e. 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022).

The scheme terminated on 30 April.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 65,661 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 26 May 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;10,762,518, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,152,504, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   <\/p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.  <\/p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme.   However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:<\/p>  <p>  - In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It will apply until 31 December 2021.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality.<\/p>  <p>  - In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. I have been clear that there will be no cliff-edge to the EWSS. Subject to the Government meeting today, there may be further announcements in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  - The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.<\/p>  <p>  - Finally, businesses may also be eligible under the Debt Warehousing Scheme to &lsquo;park&rsquo; certain VAT and PAYE (Employer) liabilities, outstanding balances of self-assessed Income Tax for 2019 and Preliminary Tax for 2020 as well as other liabilities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":533,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":534,"qnumday":264,"qnumall":"[29539\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he plans to reinstate a system such as the one parent family tax credit to provide tax credits for parents who are co-parenting (details supplied); if consideration has been given to the many different approaches to sharing parenting responsibilities and the financial implications of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":535,"content":"<p>The 2009 Commission on Taxation reviewed the One-Parent Family Tax Credit and acknowledged that it played a role in supporting and incentivising the labour market participation of single and widowed parents.

It is essential to review all tax reliefs, credits and incentives in order to ensure that they are properly targeted and if necessary re-focused in order that they could achieve the socio-economic objectives that are set for them. A feature of the One-Parent Family Tax Credit was that it could be claimed by multiple individuals in respect of the same child, resulting in an unsustainable position.<\/p><p>The One-Parent Family Tax Credit was replaced with the Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit from 1 January 2014. The restructured credit is of the same value i.e. &euro;1,650 per annum as the one-parent family tax credit and it also carries the same entitlement to the additional &euro;4,000 extended standard rate band, which increases that band to &euro;36,800 per annum, before liability to higher rate of income tax arises. However, the credit is more strategically targeted, in that it will in the first instance only be available to the principal carer of the child.<\/p><p>The Single Person Child Carer Credit is available to you if you are the &lsquo;primary claimant&rsquo;. To be a primary claimant your qualifying child must live with you for the whole, or greater part, of the year (a period greater than 6 months).

As detailed in the response, it is not possible to release some of the information requested.<\/p><p>In broad terms, a &lsquo;Protected Disclosure&rsquo; is a disclosure of information which the discloser believes may reveal wrongdoing and which came to the attention of the discloser through their employment. This is a very broad category of information. As such, it can be expected that in many cases disclosures falling into this category are received and dealt with in an appropriate proper manner without the person making the disclosure or those receiving it ever adverting to the fact that the information could be regarded as constituting a Protected Disclosure.<\/p><p>The legal obligations which arise in respect of Protected Disclosures consist principally of not penalising the discloser for making the disclosure and protecting the identity of the person making the disclosure in some circumstances.  These obligations would be routinely met without the need for any legal obligation to compel this to occur, so that it is generally not relevant whether the information constitutes a Protected Disclosure within the meaning of the legislation or not. It is, therefore, not possible to be certain that no disclosures which fall within the definition of Protected Disclosure but which have not been formally identified as a Protected Disclosure per se have been received. <\/p><p>It is for these reasons that it is not possible to provide a comprehensive and exhaustive response to the Deputy's question.  Having said that, it is important to state that the Department of Finance has put in place policy and procedures for the making of Protected Disclosures in the Department, which have been developed in line with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and agreed by the Department&rsquo;s Executive Board. This sets out the process by which a &lsquo;worker&rsquo; of the Department can make a Protected Disclosure, what will happen when a disclosure is made, and what the Department will do to protect the discloser.<\/p><p>The process supports the Department&rsquo;s strong commitment to ensuring that the culture and working environment of the Department encourage, facilitate and support any member of staff of the Department in &lsquo;speaking-up&rsquo; on any issue that may impact adversely on the Department&rsquo;s ability to properly and fully carry out all its roles and responsibilities to the highest performance standard required. Two alternative confidential recipients have been nominated to receive Protected Disclosures from internal staff, in the event that a staff member does not wish to make the disclosure to their Line Manager or the normal Senior Management Team. These nominees are the Department&rsquo;s Head of Legal and the Compliance Officer. To date, neither of these officers have received such an internal Protected Disclosure.<\/p><p>Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures Act requires the publication of a report in respect of Protected Disclosures received in the preceding year setting out certain information in respect of any Protected Disclosures received. For the purposes of complying with section 22, the Department publishes information regarding Protected Disclosures formally identified as such, without identifying the person making the disclosure.  Previous reports indicate that one Protected Disclosure was received in 2017 with a further one in 2018 and another one in 2019.  No Protected Disclosure was received during 2020 and this fact will be reflected in the required report for 2020 that is due to be published by this coming June.  To date, there has been no Protected Disclosure in 2021.<\/p><p>Tabular summary: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>No of Protected Disclosures<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2016 <\/td>       <td>Nil <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>nil <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>nil to date<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK02700"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[29654\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100068#WRK02800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of meetings he or the Minister for State with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance have held with insurers and underwriters since 1 June 2020 regarding professional indemnity insurance for construction professions and construction-related professions with particular reference to fire safety concerns and the withdrawal of underwriters from the market.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":553,"content":"<p>At the outset, I would like to note that the Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups, including in the construction and related professions, around the cost and availability of insurance cover.

It is intended that an Executive Chairperson and 3 commissioners, including an Online Safety Commissioner, will be appointed initially following a recruitment campaign by the Public Appointments Service.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme provides that the Commission will delegate the performance of certain functional areas to individual commissioners and it's intended that the person recruited as the Online Safety Commissioner will be delegated the online safety related functions of the Commission. This approach was taken on foot of legal advice that specifying the exact role of each commissioner in the Bill would make it difficult to appoint additional commissioners to work on online safety in the future.<\/p>  <p>  The goal of the regulatory framework for online safety will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how regulated online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms. This is a risk based approach that is intended to drive towards the best possible outcomes for all users of online services.<\/p>  <p>  While there is an appreciation of the desire for an individual complaints mechanism, there are serious doubts about the effectiveness of a statutory mechanism of this kind in the online safety space. There are a number of reasons for this, including that:<\/p>  <p>- requirements for fair procedures would not facilitate a swift resolution of individual issues, as it would be necessary to engage with the uploader of content as well as the complainant;<\/p>  <p>- the volume of online content, particularly as Ireland will be regulating Video Sharing Platform Services for the whole of the EU population of 450 million people, would overwhelm even the best resourced regulator<\/p>  <p>- referring complaints relating to individual items of content that are potentially criminal in nature to a civil regulator instead of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not be appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Among other things however, the Bill provides the Commission with the power to oblige designated online services to have effective complaints and appeals mechanisms in place and also the power to audit those mechanisms. This is part of the risk-based framework that will enable the Commission to seek the greatest degree of protection for all users through systemic oversight.<\/p>  <p>  Individuals will always be able to bring issues to the attention of the Commission and the Commission will also have the power to order the removal of individual items of content in certain discrete instances. However, this will not be a formal complaints mechanism. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission will also be empowered to set up a systemic complaints scheme to receive complaints from nominated bodies such as expert NGOs about trends in the prevalence of harmful online content and the effectiveness of measures taken by regulated online services to comply with their obligations. This will help to inform the Commission about what the prominent and emerging risks are at any point in time and inform the Commission's approach to making online safety codes and conducting audits and investigations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100069#WRL06075","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100069#WRL06100"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":308,"qnumall":"[29747\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100069#WRL06200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"when the plan for a return of spectators to sports grounds will be published; the trail event that will be held; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1555","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>Minister Martin and I announced on Friday 28 May that we will begin to trial the safe return of spectators to sporting events in June and July.

An application for such permission provides an opportunity for members of the public to make submissions or observations in respect of the proposed development\u00a0while also providing the\u00a0planning authority with the opportunity to consider a range of potential impacts, such as increased traffic, in the area that may result from\u00a0any such proposed\u00a0change of use.<\/p>  <p>  If\u00a0a person\u00a0wishes to establish whether or not planning permission is required for a\u00a0specific development proposal, they can seek a declaration from their local authority under Section 5 of the Act.<\/p>  <p>As\u00a0outlined, the current legislation provides\u00a0for the construction of certain structures in the back gardens of residences,\u00a0including\u00a0for the purpose of home offices.\u00a0 Accordingly, I do not have any plans\u00a0for the making of further legislative changes or the\u00a0issuing of new guidelines in this regard at this time.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wastewater Treatment","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM01400"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":317,"qnumall":"[29245\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if legislation will be amended to allow Irish Water to take over estates with builder-built wastewater treatment systems;

This is evident in the high number of HAP tenancies that continued to be\u00a0set-up this year. The 2021 HAP target is for 15,000 additional tenancies and, at the end of Q1 2021, 3,914 HAP tenancies (26% of target) had been established.<\/p>  <p>  Measures that were required to be taken in the context of Covid-19, however, have had an impact on processing times for HAP applications, including Homeless HAP Applications. The average processing time at end Q4, 2020 was 38 days.\u00a0 An analysis of more recent data from the HAP SSC indicates a reduction on that average processing time at end Q1, 2021 to 35 days.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities are keenly aware of the importance of minimising HAP processing times and the critical need to keep this under review at a local level.\u00a0My Department\u00a0has communicated this to\u00a0local authority management through the\u00a0County and City Management Association. <\/p>  <p>  It should be acknowledged that any delay in tenants and landlords supplying relevant information, or\u00a0inaccuracies or missing information, will impact on the processing time of the HAP application.\u00a0However, in instances where there are delays at the processing\u00a0stage within a local authority, payment to the landlord will be backdated to the date on which a complete and valid application form was received by the local authority.\u00a0The landlord is, therefore, not penalised for any delay.<\/p>  <p>  Through our ongoing engagement with local authorities my Department has stressed the need to minimise delays in processing these vital applications to ensure the social housing needs of tenants can be met through the HAP scheme where required. My Department is closely monitoring this situation and will continue to do so over the coming months. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, as you are aware, under HAP, households at risk of homelessness may be eligible for additional supports.\u00a0 To qualify for specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":711,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":712,"qnumday":323,"qnumall":"[29352\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100070#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount provided by his Department to Tipperary Council in 2020 in respect of housing supports (details supplied).","asker":"1612","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":713,"content":"<p>The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a flexible and immediate housing support that is\u00a0available to all eligible households throughout the State.

In April 2016, the Management Board published the first EVG Report titled &ldquo;Local Delivery - National Consistency&rdquo;.\u00a0 The Report, which sets out details of the process as well as findings is available on my Department's website at the following link:<\/p><p>This first EVG report was welcomed as a benchmark of local authority provision of fire services in Ireland, and reviewed a number of themes. For the first time, it reported on the matching of provision of fire services with assessed fire risk. It reviewed fire safety work and undertook an assessment of the impact of national guidance on safety, health and welfare of staff in fire services. The Report concluded that the public are served well by the locally authority provided fire service arrangements and can retain confidence in the integrity and professionalism of those with responsibility for managing and delivering fire safety and fire services in Ireland. <\/p><p>In May 2019, the Management Board of NDFEM considered a proposal for a second round of external validation, or EVG II. Stakeholder engagement was undertaken in preparation for a thematic review process, which was scheduled to commence in Q1 2020. However, due to Covid-19, the Board made a decision to postpone this process. <\/p><p>As an alternative, in May 2020, the Board mandated staff in the NDFEM to undertake a review of the impact of Covid-19 on local authority fire service resilience and response, as well as on fire safety work and to look at fire services roles in supporting Covid-related emergency management. The objective\u00a0was to capture\u00a0 issues arising, lessons to be learned and good practice which worked during the first phase of Covid-19 response, so that essential services could continue to be maintained in case of further surges. <\/p><p>This review was undertaken by means of &lsquo;virtual visits&rsquo; (i.e. by Webex link) to each of the 27 fire services and three Regional Communications Centres. This &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; process was undertaken by an NDFEM team, working in association with Chief Fire Officers and their staff and local authority executives. These visits were undertaken between the 24th of June\u00a0and the 22nd of September 2020.\u00a0 A composite report on themes related to the impact of Covid-19 on fire services, titled 'Response and Resilience' was compiled and presented to the NDFEM Management Board in October 2020.

My Department has invited all local authorities to submit applications to it with respect to properties of natural and\/or cultural heritage within their area of responsibility, which may meet the requirements for inclusion on the Tentative List. The deadline for applications is 30 June 2021.<\/p><p>My Department's policy is for applications to be promoted and sponsored by the relevant local authorities in order to ensure continuity throughout the process. Other organizations, community groups or individuals interested in submitting an application have been encouraged to apply in collaboration with the local authority and support has been provided when appropriate to do so. The role of the local authorities to lead engagement with community organisations on the ground is crucial in order to facilitate public consultation and wider stakeholder involvement, particularly in light of the requirement under the UNESCO Operational Guidelines for participatory planning and stakeholder consultation. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service has been liaising very closely with those local authorities that have expressed interest in having a site  within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List, providing advice and guidance on an ongoing basis and encouraging them to engage with relevant stakeholders at a local level.<\/p><p>My Department has engaged with all local authorities who expressed an interest in having a site within their county boundaries included on the revised Tentative List. This engagement has included facilitating two World Heritage Workshops in collaboration with ICOMOS Ireland, one held in Killarney in February 2020 and a follow-up workshop online in June 2020. These workshops focussed on next steps in the review process, World Heritage knowledge sharing, management of serial and transboundary applications, and the requirements of completing the Tentative List application form. At these workshops the challenges in the preparation of nomination documentation and management plans for prospective World Heritage properties was detailed and the need for wide public consultation and local stakeholder engagement was reinforced. <\/p><p>Following attendance at the workshops, interested parties were requested to submit draft Tentative List applications for review and feedback to ensure that the next Tentative List features properties that are well-placed to progress to World Heritage nomination. Throughout November and December 2020 my Department facilitated feedback in relation to the draft applications through individual online meetings with a World Heritage Expert. <\/p><p>My Department has also commissioned studies to further inform the review process for the Tentative List:<\/p><p>- Peer review of the 2014 Burren Technical Evaluation as a World Heritage Site, 2020;<\/p><p>- Glendalough OUV Study, expected June 2021;and<\/p><p>- Valentia Cable Station and Associated Sites, Heritage Study, 2020.<\/p><p>The basis for not anticipating an application for The Early Medieval Monastic Sites, other than Glendalough Monastic Site, is because despite the huge encouragement there was no engagement with my Department by all the relevant local authorities in respect of a revised application. <\/p><p>The anticipation for receiving applications in respect of The Burren, Glendalough Monastic Site, The Passage Tomb Landscapes of Sligo, The Royal Sites, and Valentia Transatlantic Cable Station is based on the level of engagement withthe process by and from  the relevant local authorities, working in conjunction with community organisations. Draft applications have been received for these properties and the local authorities are working with relevant stakeholders to demonstrate that there is sufficient support for the project in the community.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100071#WRN02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1512"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":779,"content":"<p>Question No. 345 answered with Question No. 344.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":780,"content":"<p>Question No. 346 answered with Question No. 344.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Water Services","counter":781,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100071#WRN02600"},{"type":"question","counter":782,"qnumday":347,"qnumall":"[29797\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100071#WRN02700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the amount paid from the Exchequer to Irish Water, that is, current and capital each year since its inception up to the end of 2020; the provision in the estimate for 2021 for Irish Water; the estimated provision of funding over the next five years to allow it deal with the critical under investment in public water and wastewater services in the past; if Irish Water has confirmed to him that it has the necessary approvals from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to allow it to proceed with its investment plans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":783,"content":"<p>Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.

My Department wrote again to planning authorities on 2 July and 26 September of that year seeking new or revised estimates following\u00a0the designation of additional RPZs in certain parts of the country, which extended the application of the STL provisions to these areas.

The administrative fleet are vehicles that can be purchased commercially such as saloon, stores vehicles and minibuses. They comprise approximately 45% of the Defence Forces fleet. <\/p><p>In line with Government policy in relation to the Clean Vehicle Directive, the Defence Forces are committed to procuring vehicles that have reduced carbon emissions. <\/p><p>Due to the specific nature and requirements of the military fleet of vehicles and the locations where they are likely to operate, these vehicles are Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) type and will be replaced, as required, with fossil fuel ICE vehicles for the reasons outlined above. The Defence Forces, however, endeavours to replace these ICE vehicles with more energy efficient models where possible. For example, the new SUV and Troop Carrying Vehicle (TCV) fleets will be replaced with EURO 6 compliant engines which will result in a 50% reduction in emissions compared to the older EURO 3 engines which they replace. <\/p><p>The Defence Forces has committed to replacing the administrative fleet with energy efficient (green vehicles) as the technology allows. To date the investment in energy efficient vehicles as outlined in Table 1 above amounts to &euro;1.2m inclusive of VAT.

In subjects or modules where it is not specifically mentioned\u00a0the topic of breastfeeding\u00a0may occur during class conversation and through interactions with students.<\/p>  <p>  For example, from a nutritional aspect the subject of breastfeeding may come up in Post Primary Home Economics when discussing healthy lifestyles and nutritional requirements across all ages. In the Leaving Certificate Applied Childcare\/Community care module on the care of babies and young children, Unit 1 addresses breast and bottle feeding. <\/p>  <p>  From a social aspect, Junior Cycle Home Economics includes Strand Two on exploring the roles and responsibilities of the family while Leaving Certificate Home Economics includes Topic 3.1.6: Family As\u00a0A Caring Unit. In Leaving Certificate Applied Social Education,the\u00a0module on Social and Health Education, Unit 2: Relationships &ndash;\u00a0 the topic may be covered while discussing parenting and the needs that children have at various stages of their development.<\/p>  <p>  Further relevant subjects would be within the SPHE curriculum. Junior Cycle SPHE Strand Two: Minding Myself and Others contains learning outcomes 2.3: describe what promotes a sense of belonging in school, at home and in the wider community and their own role in creating an inclusive environment and 2.4: distinguish between appropriate care giving and receiving. At Leaving Certificate level, SPHE aims to develop health literacy, both for the individual student and for groups. Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally,\u00a0the Department of Health has produced\u00a0a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In general, my Department does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any educational textbook. The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.\u00a0 A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.\u00a0 Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100073#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100073#WRP00800"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":390,"qnumall":"[29157\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100073#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a policy is in place to ensure that in areas in which new schools are needed that the facilities of existing schools do not become neglected which could lead to an undesirable migration to the newer schools with the more modern facilities as in the case of Howth, Dublin 13, planning area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1549","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>New schools are established by my Department on the basis of identified demographic demand in an area, and only after consideration of the capacity of existing schools to absorb the expected school place demand.\u00a0 Furthermore, such new schools are required to build their enrolments incrementally, with an intake of Junior Infants or First Years each year, in order to mitigate any impact on the enrolments at other schools in the area.\u00a0 As the new school&rsquo;s enrolment capacity, therefore, increases in tandem with emerging demographic demand, it is not expected that there would be a shift in pupil attendance from existing to newer schools.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan (NDP), increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.\u00a0 This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with demographic demand.

The surplus to be surrendered to the Exchequer is the amount of funds voted for the Department&rsquo;s services by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann remaining unspent at year end and also takes account of additional income amounts received during the year.

However, the provisional figure for 2020 is &euro;138 Million, which equates to 1.6% of the voted budget for the year.  This surrender arose due to the reduced costs of certain services within the schools sector due to public health restrictions in place in 2020 and some surplus on the ring-fenced Covid financial supports for schools.<\/p><p>While the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Education Needs Officers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for assistive technology support, the relevant funding comes from the Department&rsquo;s Vote.

calculation model, as the year a person commenced paying social insurance contributions is no longer a key determining factor for pension entitlement rate calculation.\u00a0 Instead, the totality of social insurance contributions paid and credited are central to the calculation.\u00a0 The new method also, for the first time, acknowledged home-caring periods prior to 1994. <\/p>  <p>  This was an equitable approach as pension outcomes were more in line with the total number of contributions paid and credited, with significant provision for years of caring in the home. <\/p>  <p>  Work began on the examining the social insurance records of over 90,000 pensioners in September 2018 and review outcomes, provided for under the Social Welfare, Pension &amp;amp; Civil Registrations Act 2018, began issuing from 13 February 2019 - the day after the necessary Regulations were signed.<\/p>  <p>  Where the review resulted in an increase in the pensioner&rsquo;s rate of payment, the increase was backdated to 30 March 2018 or the pensioner's 66th birthday, whichever was the later.\u00a0 As at the end of October 2019, with the project completed, 94,258 reviews were finalised.\u00a0 Of these, 53,092 (56%) were women and 41,166 (44%) were\u00a0men.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Of the 53,092 women reviewed 28,528\u00a0(54%) received an increase while the rest remained on their existing rate.\u00a0 Of the 41,164 men reviewed, 9,956 (24%)\u00a0received an increase and the remainder continue to receive their same rate of payment.\u00a0\u00a0No pensioner had their pension reduced as part of this review.\u00a0 For those who received an increase in their rate of payment, the average weekly personal rate increased by &euro;20.27 per week (Women &euro;24.23;

The mission of the scheme is to provide out-of-school supports to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people in their communities to enable them to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential.

Employer input should ensure that courses are structured in a manner that meets the operational realities of businesses, including through the use of flexible and online learning. Engagement with industry also provides vital market intelligence with respect to evolving skills needs. Fast moving sectors are reliant on responsive skills development and training solutions to reflect technology, product and service innovation. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Skills to Advance initiative was developed in response to evolving skill needs and assists those facing changes in their work due to technology advances, changing work practices and market diversification. Further education and training (FET) opportunities offered through Skills to Advance incorporate digital, socio-emotional and technical skills development to enhance employee skills and support increased productivity in Irish SMEs. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the Skills to Advance initiative, SOLAS created the Innovation through Collaboration Fund specifically to support collaborative partnerships by ETBs with the private sector, researchers and academics to meet the skills needs for innovation across economic sectors. Two of ten Innovation through Collaboration projects focus on specific challenges in manufacturing; delivering up-to-the-minute skills using flexible delivery methods, and recognising the existing skills and competencies of technicians while providing upskilling pathways for an increasingly digitised workplace. A new call for this fund is due to be issued in July 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The Advanced Manufacturing Training Centre of Excellence (AMTCE) in Dundalk provides one of the examples of reskilling and upskilling training courses\/programmes and services supported by Innovation through Collaboration Fund. Through the AMTCE, Louth Meath ETB (LMETB) is using advanced technologies to provide innovative and creative solutions to address the upskilling needs of those employed in the manufacturing technology areas and to provide employers with the knowledge skills and competencies to make informed decisions regarding planning for the skills requirements of both existing and new employees; including displaced employees, alongside opportunities for reskilling persons who are unemployed. The AMTCE utilises Innovative methodologies to facilitate and deliver training \/upskilling, including use of remote, blended online and onsite learning modalities. The AMTCE harnesses innovative technologies such as VR and AI technologies. <\/p>  <p>  The manufacturing sector is undergoing a significant transformation through the adoption of industry 4.0 technologies such as robotics, AI and additive manufacturing. Adoption of these technologies is key to enabling Irish companies to remain competitive in the face of global competition and to drive value-add product and service innovation. There is a need to upskill the existing workforce to enable companies to adopt and utilise advanced technologies to support and enhance business competitiveness. The growing need for advanced skills within the manufacturing sector also represents a significant opportunity for people to establish new careers in the sector through appropriate reskilling. The AMTCE is addressing these needs through the provision of high-quality training based on industry needs through flexible delivery mechanisms. The AMTCE centre will provide access to state-of-art equipment to ensure learners receive high quality hands-on training which is highly valued by employers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Innovation through Collaboration Fund, funding has also been secured by Cavan Monaghan ETB (CMETB) to progress the development of a new FET Centre of Excellence in Supply Chain Logistics and Procurement supporting business transformation and workforce skills being developed in Cavan to support the North East region and nationally. This project is part of a &euro;3 million investment for local projects under the Border Enterprise Development Fund, an economic stimulus package established for the border region, and additional funding from SOLAS and my Department.

This was the most serious outbreak to occur within the prison system to date and resulted in 38 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the general prisoner population. <\/p>  <p>  The outbreak was managed in line with the Prison Service Contingency Plan for the Management of Covid-19, which sets out the actions and measures to be implemented in such situations. The outbreak was managed by an Outbreak Control Team, led by the Director General, and was successfully contained, once identified, resulting in the return of a more normal regime on 21 May, 2021.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Prison Service that prisoners continue to send and receive post throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. During the mass testing process which occurs during an outbreak, however, all outgoing post is suspended. <\/p>  <p>  During the outbreak in Mountjoy Prison, incoming post continued to be accepted, was reviewed by the Censor&rsquo;s Office and delivered as normal. I am also pleased to advise the Deputy that as the prison has exited from the outbreak regime, the outgoing postal services within the prison are again operating as normal.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to prisoner property, I am also advised that, due to infection control restrictions, and the fact that physical visits remained suspended, it is currently the case that family members cannot drop prisoner property off at the prison.\u00a0Property is only accepted by post and all property is quarantined for\u00a0seven days before distribution to prisoners. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with the Contingency Plan, in situations where there is a positive case in the general prison population, all prisoner movement in a prison is restricted while testing, contact tracing and assessment of the risk of the spread of the infection continues. Prisoners involved in the provision of services within the prison (kitchen, laundry etc.) continue to work with an enhanced level of PPE providing they are not a close contact of any confirmed case. Prisoners are fed and medicated at their door and\u00a0are permitted to leave their cell in a controlled manner to make telephone calls.<\/p>  <p>  Once the results of first round testing of all prisoners and all staff are received, any prisoners with negative test results have a degree of regime restored which strives to meet the minimum out of cell time provision of two hours. Positive prisoners and their close contacts are isolated or quarantined in accordance with HSE guidance. <\/p>  <p>  The measures implemented by the Prison Service have impacted the traditional manner of service delivery by the Psychology and Addiction Counselling Services. Notwithstanding the challenges imposed by managing traditionally close-contact services during a pandemic, it is important to note that these services have not been suspended at anytime to date. The Prison Service continues to provide a range of therapeutic, support and counselling services to prisoners. The primary forms of counselling are provided by the Prison Service Psychology Service and the Merchant&rsquo;s Quay Ireland Addiction Counselling Service. These services have remained in place throughout the pandemic.<\/p>  <p>  The restrictions imposed by Covid-19 have required the development of new ways of working to support prisoners.

the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1270,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, restorative justice is a criminal justice process which has been shown to help victims recover from crime, reduce reoffending and save public resources and it\u00a0is now widely accepted that restorative justice is compatible with the traditional criminal justice systems of both common law and civil law jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Programme for Government\u00a0includes a commitment to work with all criminal justice agencies to build capacity to deliver restorative justice safely and effectively. In this context, the Probation Service has formally recognised restorative justice since the 1990s as one method within a suite of measures to provide an effective response to crime. In 2000, two dedicated community based projects were established; the\u00a0Restorative Justice Service, and\u00a0Restorative Justice in the Community, both of which have since extended their catchment areas and now offer services across the Greater Dublin area, as well as\u00a0Tipperary, Laois and Offaly,\u00a0respectively. These were established and funded through the Probation Service and\u00a0both projects provide a restorative justice service to the courts through the use of reparation panels and \/or victim offender mediation.<\/p>  <p>  Significant developments since then include a report of the National Commission on Restorative Justice which\u00a0was\u00a0published in 2009 and the Report of the Penal Policy Review Group published in 2014. Both reports supported the wider application of Restorative Justice in probation practice. The Commission's report recommended that the Probation Service continue to be the lead agency in implementing the wider application of restorative justice.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, Section 78 of the Children Act (2001) made provision for the introduction of the Probation Family Conference. Following the commencement of the Act in 2005, this was rolled out through Young Persons Probation, a dedicated\u00a0part of the Probation Service established to deliver the community sanctions provided for in the Act. While conferencing has now been integrated in to the supervision of some young people, the number of referrals from the courts has declined in recent years.<\/p>  <p>  More recent developments in this area\u00a0include the establishment in 2018 of the dedicated Restorative Justice and Victims Services Unit in the Probation Service in\u00a0response to the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017. Furthermore, the Joint Action Plan for the\u00a0 Management of Offenders 2019-2021 also contains a commitment to develop joint arrangements, including victim\/offender mediation, for providing victims of crime with opportunities for positive, restorative responses to the harm they have experienced.<\/p>  <p>  The Probation Service\u00a0and my Department are stakeholders in a four year cross-European project (2019-2023), Restorative Justice: Strategies for Change (RJS4C), with partners from ten countries collaborating to implement the Council of Europe Recommendation that restorative justice should be available at any stage of the Criminal Justice process to any victim and any offender.\u00a0To this end, the RJS4C has produced an Restorative Justice Collective Strategy for Ireland 2019-2023 to promote and\u00a0increase awareness and accessibility to Restorative Justice.<\/p>  <p>  The delivery of Restorative Justice safely and effectively is one of the strategic objectives for the Department over the next three years. Five high level actions have been identified and outlined in the Justice Plan 2021, two of which have been completed to date, including\u00a0the mapping of\u00a0the current state of play of Restorative Justice and the\u00a0activation of a Restorative Justice case study website. In January this year Minister of State Browne launched restorativejustice.ie. which is funded by the Department. This website maps the use of Restorative Justice in criminal justice in Ireland and contains over 35 case studies of both restorative justice and restorative practice and other resources.<\/p>  <p>  Further actions planned for quarter three and four include;\u00a0the development of\u00a0options for an appropriate mechanism and process to create awareness and availability of Restorative Justice at all stages of the criminal justice system, with consistency of service ensuring quality in training and practice;\u00a0consultations with stakeholders; and\u00a0the finalisation of\u00a0a policy paper.\u00a0It is\u00a0intended to publish the policy proposals by year end.<\/p>  <p>  To further progress and deliver on the above, it is proposed that an Action Plan will be developed by\u00a0my Department and the Probation Service this year. Key components will include establishing a mechanism and process to create greater awareness and availability of Restorative Justice interventions at all stages of the criminal justice system and further training and development for those delivering Restorative Justice interventions - ensuring consistency and quality of service provision.\u00a0In accepting this as a policy driver, the main challenge to applying it in practice is national accessibility and consultation with key stakeholders which will be central to development of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is also important to note that the\u00a0Department&rsquo;s plan to help victims and vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases, Supporting A Victim's Journey, also contains commitments to scope requirements for a more integrated consistent, visible and high quality Restorative Justice service for vulnerable victims who wish to pursue that pathway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100078#WRU00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1271,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100078#WRU00800"},{"type":"question","counter":1272,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[29471\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021060100078#WRU00900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the amount that has been seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau since it was established in 1996, in tabular form.","asker":"1485","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1273,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) is a multi-agency statutory body established under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996.

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau (GNDOCB) is having significant success in disrupting the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups. Its work is supported by Divisional Drugs Units nationwide and by all Garda&iacute; working in local communities, while working closely\u00a0with international law enforcement partners.<\/p>  <p>  The National Drugs Strategy, \"Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery - a health led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025 \", is unique among national drugs strategies across EU Member States in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy includes an action (4.1.42) which specifically relates to strengthening the effectiveness of the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme. The programme, which was developed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the National Family Support Network (NFSN) to respond to the needs of drug users and family members who may be subject to the threat of drug related intimidation, has been implemented on a national level since 2013. In addition, the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future,\u00a0includes a commitment to support the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme.<\/p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na regard drug-related intimidation as a hugely serious issue which impacts significantly on communities throughout Ireland. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na advise people to seek help and support from their local Garda&iacute;, even where a person has felt compelled to pay money to those who engage in drug related intimidation.<\/p>  <p>  In dealing with any complaint of drug related intimidation, or advice sought in relation to this issue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have the utmost regard to the safety and most effective means to afford the person or family subject to the threat the best level of security, advice and support. Confidentiality and security of the persons concerned are paramount for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with reports under the programme.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin's North East Inner City specifically, there has been work done by the NEIC Programme Implementation Board on the issue of drug-related intimidation through the Ana Liffey Drug Project. This work is being taken forward by a sub group of the Implementation Board.<\/p>  <p>  I consulted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to the Deputy's query on the number of times support has been sought from and provided under the drug related intimidation reporting programme since it was established.
