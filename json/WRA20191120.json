For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.<\/p><p>The 2017 Act also set out a non-exhaustive list of\u00a0circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind. \u00a0<\/p><p>In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.<\/p><p>1. Sexual intercourse must have taken place;<\/p><p>2. the\u00a0person must not have consented; and<\/p><p>3. the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.<\/p><p>During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be reasonably held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused honestly believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented\u00a0would not be found guilty of rape.<\/p><p>It was on foot of those debates that\u00a0the Attorney General and my predecessor as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Commission's recently published Report\u00a0recommends a change in the law to state that the belief of the accused person in consent must be reasonably held.\u00a0It also touches on some of the surrounding matters which are being examined elsewhere, such as rape myths and stereotypes, obstacles to prosecution in rape cases, the treatment of victims in rape cases and other related matters.<\/p><p>The timing of the Commission's\u00a0report is particularly welcome, given that the review of protections for vulnerable witness in the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences, chaired by an expert barrister Tom O&rsquo;Malley, is due to be completed by the end of this year.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I intend to consider these two sets of recommendations in tandem and\u00a0I therefore have asked my officials to examine the Law Reform Commission's Report in detail with a view to bringing forward proposals to implement its recommendations.\u00a0\u00a0Any recommendations which may arise out\u00a0from the O&rsquo;Malley review group and which may be of assistance in supporting victims and vulnerable witnesses will feed into this process, while of course maintaining\u00a0the necessary fairness and balance inherent in\u00a0our criminal justice system. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000069#WRA02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Succession Act","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000069#WRA02500"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[47783\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000069#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the extent of proposed changes in the law to protect the integrity of wills and prevent unscrupulous third parties from inveigling themselves into the confidence of vulnerable persons for their own benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":28,"content":"<p>The position is that Part VII of the Succession Act 1965 sets out\u00a0a number of\u00a0legal requirements for the making of a valid will:<\/p><p>- It must be in writing;<\/p><p>- The testator must be over 18 years of age (the\u00a0testator may be under 18 if he or she is or has been married);<\/p><p>- The testator must be of sound mind;<\/p><p>- The\u00a0testator must sign or mark the will\u00a0in the presence of two witnesses;<\/p><p>- The two\u00a0witnesses must sign the will in\u00a0the\u00a0testator's presence;<\/p><p>- The witnesses\u00a0cannot be beneficiaries of the will;<\/p><p>- The witnesses must see the testator sign the\u00a0will;<\/p><p>- The signature of the testator must be at the\u00a0end of the will.<\/p><p>These statutory provisions, as interpreted by the superior courts in relevant case law,\u00a0provide\u00a0robust safeguards in relation to the validity of wills.<\/p><p>It is,\u00a0of\u00a0course, possible for a person to commence legal proceedings challenging\u00a0a will on the grounds of either the diminished capacity of the\u00a0testator\u00a0to make a valid will, or the testator's ability to make decisions freely in disposing of their property by will.<\/p><p>When\u00a0determining whether or not a testator\u00a0had the capacity to make a will, courts will generally consider\u00a0whether they understood the nature of the act of making the\u00a0will and its effect, and\u00a0whether the testator\u00a0understood the extent of the property of which they were disposing.<\/p><p>Where undue influence is alleged, the law\u00a0places\u00a0the burden\u00a0of proving such undue influence\u00a0on the person alleging it.

There is close ongoing cooperation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI and other law enforcement agencies who all work closely together on a broad range of policing responsibilities.  <\/p><p>As I have outlined in the Houses previously, the existing multi-agency cooperative arrangements in place to tackle cross-border crime are already quite structured and successful.<\/p><p>The Deputy will be aware that in November 2015 the British and Irish Governments and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed a series of measures in the <i>Fresh Start <\/i>agreement, as part of a concerted and enhanced effort to tackle organised and cross jurisdictional crime.  These measures included the creation of the Joint Agency Task Force which is led by senior officers from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and UK Revenue and Customs.  A number of other relevant bodies, including the National Crime Agency and the Criminal Assets Bureau are also closely involved.<\/p><p>The objective of the Task Force is to build on existing law enforcement frameworks and to increase the collective effectiveness of operational actions.  In this format, the senior management level of the two police services provide strong strategic direction and oversight to front-line operational activities.  <\/p><p>The Task Force has had some notable success in tackling cross-border criminal activity across a range of crime areas.  These include not just traditional smuggling activities, but also rural and farm crimes, organised burglary and drug crime.<\/p><p>The regrettable absence of an Executive in Northern Ireland means that the work of the Task Force is less visible than it might have been.  It was designed to report to Justice Ministers north and south and it is my hope that the restoration of power sharing in Northern Ireland will allow the Task Force to reach its full potential. <\/p><p>The multi-agency nature of the Task Force is critical to its success. It is a strong example of the extensive North-South cooperation between the police, customs services and other law enforcement agencies involved in tackling crime and enhancing the safety of all communities on both sides of the border. The Task Force complements both the ongoing formal and informal co-operation between AGS and PSNI. <\/p><p>The Deputy may also be interested to note that the collaboration between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI was recently extended with establishment of the first ever AGS-PSNI Joint Investigation Team involving Eurojust. This is a very significant and positive development will further strengthen the already close and positive cooperation between police services on the island of Ireland. <\/p><p>Finally, I would assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the full support of the Government in its ongoing work in addressing cross-border criminality and we are providing record resources to enable it to perform this critical role. The Northern region continues to benefit from the accelerated recruitment to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, supported by the unprecedented level of Government funding to the organisation.<\/p><p>Garda strength in the Northern Region has increased to approximately 1,500, an increase of 150 Garda&iacute; since the end of 2017.  These Garda&iacute; are supported by approximately 160 Garda staff in the region, which represents an increase of almost 35% over the past 3 years, with the result that additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Programme","counter":46,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB00600"},{"type":"question","counter":47,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[47778\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB00700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":48,"content":"<p>Addressing\u00a0the gender pay gap is an important element in the Programme for a Partnership Government and is included as a key commitment in\u00a0the Government's\u00a0National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019\u00a0was published on 8 April \u00a02019 and the Bill\u00a0completed\u00a0D&aacute;il Committee Stage\u00a0in June.

I am pleased to have secured an overall increase of &euro;122 million to increase An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's budget for 2020 to an unprecedented &euro;1.882 billion for next year.<\/p>  <p>  This investment is supporting the sustained growth of the organisation.\u00a0\u00a0 We currently have approximately 14,200 Garda&iacute; nationwide, supported by over 2,900 Garda staff.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  And as part of the Government&rsquo;s plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, there is ongoing and increased recruitment both of new Garda&iacute; as well as Garda staff, allowing for redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational duties at the front-line. <\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda Training College in 2014, approximately 2,800 new Garda members have attested and been assigned to frontline policing duties in communities throughout the country. Another 200 probationer Garda&iacute; are due to attest next week. <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the media reports referred to by the Deputy, to the effect that on a particular date in March, only 2 Garda&iacute; were available to patrol. I can understand the concern that these reports may have caused to the Deputy, and to the people of the area.\u00a0 I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that I have raised this matter with the Garda authorities and I am informed that the media reports are incorrect. I have been assured that on the night in question, significantly more than 2 Garda&iacute; were on duty and available to patrol the city. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Garda resources in Cork City Division more generally, I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the end of October 2019, there are 700 Garda&iacute; are assigned to the Cork City Division, supported by 95 Garda staff. Additionally, they are currently supported by 33 Garda Reserve.<\/p>  <p>  The additional 49 Garda&iacute; assigned to the Cork City Division since the end of 2015, represents an increase of 7.5%. \u00a0 The increase in Garda staff numbers from 59 to 95 (equivalent to an increase of 61%) over the same period means that as well as new Garda&iacute; assigned to the Division, additional Garda&iacute; can be redeployed from administrative to operational policing duties, where their training and policing expertise can be used to best effect.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Taken together, it can be expected that the increase in both Garda members and staff numbers represents a real increase in operational policing hours within the Cork City Division. Nationally, over 500 Garda Members have been redeployed to frontline visible policing.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the next intake of probationer Garda&iacute; will be attested on 29th November, 2019 and transfer to their training stations on 2nd December, 2019. I have been informed that it is the intention of the Commissioner to allocate eight probationer Garda&iacute; to training stations within the Cork City Division on a permanent basis. <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be interested to note that for\u00a0December 2019,\u00a0the Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 24 probationers from this class to be allocated to the Cork City Division on a temporary basis to work on Operation Open City,\u00a0which involves\u00a0high visibility road policing duties over the busy Christmas period. These 24 probationers will then be re-allocated after the period concerned to their permanent training stations in Divisions outside the Cork City Division from 2nd January, 2020. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These intended allocation of resources\u00a0are contingent on the operational demands of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and as such may be subject to change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":81,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB04100"},{"type":"question","counter":82,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[47779\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000070#WRB04200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the consultation and engagement that has taken place to date with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in relation to extending eligibility for a driver licence to asylum seekers.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":83,"content":"<p>The issuing of driving licences is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the relevant agencies under his remit.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the issue is currently being examined by his Department.\u00a0 My Department sought background information from the European Migration Network as to the interpretation and implementation of the relevant EU law, \u00a0Article 12 of Directive 2006\/126\/EC on driving licences (recast),\u00a0in other member states.

It concluded that it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the required 10% margin and recommended that a new Electoral Commission be set up before convening fresh elections. <\/p>  <p>  On the same day, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini also released a statement calling for a new Electoral Court to be appointed that could offer guarantees of transparent elections, and also called on parties, particularly the authorities, to assume their democratic responsibilities and take the appropriate decisions to allow quick reconciliation and avoid further violence. Ireland supported this statement. <\/p>  <p>  Following the release of the OAS report, Mr Morales agreed to hold new elections but later in the day (10 November) resigned from his post in an effort to return stability to the country. A number of high ranking officials also resigned, including the Vice President, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, and the President of the Senate. Mr Morales took up Mexico&rsquo;s offer of political asylum and arrived in the country on 12 November. <\/p>  <p>  According to the Bolivian Constitution, and given the resignation of numerous high ranking officials, the next in line to take on the role of interim President is the Vice President of the Senate, Jeanine &Aacute;&ntilde;ez. Ms &Aacute;&ntilde;ez took up office on 12 November and on 13 November appointed a new cabinet of 11 Ministers. The caretaker Government now has 90 days to hold new elections, as defined by the Constitution.\u00a0 Ireland, alongside EU colleagues, supports a solution that allows for the interim leadership to prepare for new elections and to avoid a power vacuum which could be seriously damaging to the country. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Delegation in La Paz has been actively supporting mediation on the ground organised by the local Catholic Church to help the Bolivian parties agree on a peaceful path to new elections. I have been in contact with my EU counterparts on how best to support Bolivia in the preparation of these elections. On Monday 11 November, I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels where EU High Representative Federica Mogherini updated Foreign Ministers on the ongoing work in Bolivia. This included a discussion on the possibility of a new EU Mission to the country and of how best to assist in the election of a new Supreme Electoral Court. The EU also deployed an Election Expert Mission to the country and has several projects in support of Bolivia&rsquo;s strong civil society. <\/p>  <p>  On 15 November, the EU released another statement calling for a return to constitutional normality so that the rule of law, democratic principles and civil rights are respected. Ireland wholeheartedly supports this recent statement from the EU which also calls on law enforcement bodies to guarantee security for the Bolivian people, while respecting human rights at all times. On Sunday (17 November), the EU Ambassador to Bolivia, Leon de la Torre, met with interim President Jeanine &Aacute;&ntilde;ez and assured her that the EU would provide support during the transition period and work to ensure credible elections. Ireland is fully supportive of this approach. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with our European counterparts to support Bolivia in finding a suitable pathway towards stability. We will continue to monitor developments through our Embassy in Buenos Aires which has a concurrent accreditation to Bolivia. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Middle East Issues","counter":173,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":174,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[47994\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent violence in Gaza; the status of recent efforts at EU and international level to restart the Middle East peace process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":175,"content":"<p>There have been far too many deaths in Gaza during this latest outbreak of violence, including, tragically, the deaths of several children.

Ireland contributes humanitarian assistance to alleviate the worst of this suffering, including through our support for UNRWA, which is a key provider of public services, health and education in the area.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that 25% of the population is in need of humanitarian assistance, with serious health and medical needs and a severe lack of access to basic goods, services and medicines and medical care. Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in funding provided by the EU since 2018 for humanitarian assistance.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing humanitarian, economic, social and political crisis is also having an ever-growing effect on neighbouring countries, which are hosting approximately 80% of the 4.6 million Venezuelan refugees and migrants that are estimated by the UN High Commissioners for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation of Migration (IOM) to have left the country since 2015. It is essential that these countries are supported and the EU has responded to this need by hosting an International\u00a0Solidarity Conference on the Venezuelan Refugee and Migrant Crisis in Brussels on 28 and 29 October. This conference was co-hosted by the UNHCR and the IOM, and Ireland was represented at official level. <\/p>  <p>  I also discussed the situation in Venezuela with the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia, H.E. Carlos Holmes Trujillo Garc&iacute;a, during his visit to Dublin in September this year. Nowhere has the impact of the Venezuelan crisis been felt more strongly than in Colombia, which has received over 1.5 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees since 2015, more than any other country.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I have already authorised the deployment of two Rapid Responders to assist the UNHCR in supporting the Colombian Government&rsquo;s response to the humanitarian needs of Venezuelans in Colombia. Ireland has also contributed &euro;1 million to UNHCR towards this effort. We stand ready to assist further as the situation evolves. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I continue to firmly believe that\u00a0this crisis can only have a political, peaceful, democratic solution, excluding the use of force, through the holding of free, transparent and credible Presidential elections as soon as possible.

While these talks have now been suspended, Ireland encourages both sides to engage in good faith in an inclusive, serious and results-oriented process. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland also supports EU efforts, including through the International Contact Group (ICG) and Special Adviser Enrique Iglesias, who is engaging with all relevant actors and stakeholders in efforts to secure and support a Venezuelan-owned solution to the current crisis. I welcome the ICG statement issued on 1 November that reaffirms the Group's view that only a negotiated transition that leads to credible elections with international observation, the re-institutionalisation of public powers, and guarantees that allow political coexistence, can bring a lasting solution to the crisis. The statement also notes that Special Advisor Iglesias will visit Caracas to engage with all relevant national stakeholders in the near future, and I look forward to receiving a report of this visit after it occurs.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation in Venezuela and to engage on the issue until a lasting solution to the crisis is found.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD02000"},{"type":"question","counter":180,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[48038\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000072#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of complaints of bullying and sexual harassment, respectively received by his Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1218","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":181,"content":"<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade examines all formal complaints made to its HR Unit notwithstanding the category they fall under.

As the third-largest sporting event in the world, an estimated 20-30,000 Irish citizens travelled from Ireland and elsewhere to attend the tournament. \u00a0<\/p><p>In this context, the initial phase of the public awareness campaign aimed at an audience of rugby fans who were likely to travel to the tournament.\u00a0 The goal of that campaign was to reach this core audience with messaging about the Department&rsquo;s travel advice, as well as information on what measures to take in the event of a consular emergency or crisis while in Japan. This information remained available and was updated on the dedicated Rugby World Cup page on my Department&rsquo;s website over the tournament.<\/p><p><b>- Ireland&rsquo;s Campaign for Election to the UN\u00a0Security Council<\/b><\/p><p>On July 2<sup>nd<\/sup>2018, the Taoiseach and I publicly launched Ireland&rsquo;s campaign to secure a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council in June 2020 for the 2021-2022 term. Ireland&rsquo;s campaign is premised on three themes: Empathy, Partnership and Independence. My Department has since continued to promote public awareness of Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing campaign through online channels and costs incurred so far in 2019 in this regard are set out in Table 1 below.<\/p><p><b>- St Patrick&rsquo;s Day<\/b><\/p><p>St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is a unique opportunity to engage with the global Irish community and to promote Ireland&rsquo;s economic and political interests overseas, with levels of publicity and media attention unmatched by the National Day of any other country.<\/p><p>This year&rsquo;s programme had the largest number of countries ever visited for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.

To coincide with and complement these activities, a small amount of expenditure was incurred by my Department in relation to online promotion of an accompanying St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day video as outlined in Table 1 below. <\/p><p><b>- Global Ireland: Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for the US and Canada 2019-2025 and Global Island Summit<\/b><\/p><p>&lsquo;Global Ireland&rsquo; is an all-of-Government programme which aims to double Ireland&rsquo;s impact in the world by 2025.

Car Parking facilities are therefore available but, during busy periods, may be insufficient to meet demand. In line with OPW principles of sustainability, visitors are encouraged, where possible to walk, cycle or use public transport when travelling to the site. The Gardens are well served by Dublin Bus routes 4, 9, 83 and 155. Additional visitor parking is available at Glasnevin Cemetery and visitors can access the Gardens through the gate that connects the Gardens and the Cemetery. <\/p>  <p>  The National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin attracts over 600,000 visitors a year. During the recent half term period, the Gardens experienced unprecedented numbers of visitors (>8,000) on two particular days, creating traffic problems in the locale.  Even doubling the available car parking space, even if that were possible, would have had little or no impact on the thousands of cars attempting to reach the site on such occasions. <\/p>  <p>  The work of the Gardens, particularly in its fundamental role of conservation, research and education, is highly dependent on the vital propagation facilities and space of the nursery, which is, in effect, the powerhouse of the Gardens. When the first public carpark was constructed 19 years ago over a quarter of the original nursery area of the Gardens had to be sacrificed. Every area of the site is intensively used for the business of the Gardens and therefore it is not proposed to substantially increase car parking facilities on site.<\/p>  <p>   I can confirm nevertheless that the Office of Public Works is in consultations with Dublin City Council on the issue. A number of measures have been put in place to deal, in particular, with the issue of vehicles parking on footpaths which is the primary cause of traffic congestion in the vicinity. It is anticipated that with increased monitoring and enforcement of the 7-day cycle lane, traffic issues should be alleviated. <\/p>  <p>  In line with the sustainable living ethos of the Gardens, and as part of the Government&rsquo;s Climate Action Plan, OPW encourages those for whom driving is not a necessity, to reduce the carbon intensity of their travel.

Abatement is an important aspect of the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 (the Single Scheme Act).   Section 52(1) to 52(5) provides for the abatement of a public service pension where a retired public servant, whose pension is in payment, is re-employed in the public service such that no more of the pension when combined with the remuneration in the new job shall exceed the pensionable remuneration of the old job.<\/p>  <p>  Abatement policy remains a key component of the Single Scheme Act and addresses valid concerns about simultaneous payment of both pension and salary in the public service. Consistency in the application of abatement principles across the public service is also important to ensure that the policy is implemented. While the high level operation of abatement is monitored on an ongoing basis, there no current plans to review the application of overall pension abatement policy to specific sectors of the public service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":289,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01300"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":109,"qnumall":"[48042\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of complaints of bullying and sexual harassment, respectively received by his Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1218","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":291,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question, I wish to state that there have been no complaints of bullying and sexual harassment in respect of this Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":292,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01600"},{"type":"question","counter":293,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[48077\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of employees of his Department that were dismissed in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date 2019; the reason for the dismissal of each employee; the number of employees suspended in the same period; and the reason for the suspension of each in tabular form.","asker":"1218","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":294,"content":"<p>In response to the Deputy's question, I wish to state that there have been no dismissals in respect of this Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":295,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF01900"},{"type":"question","counter":296,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[48114\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000074#WRF02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 146 of 12 November 2019, the amount spent in his Department on the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and Project Ireland 2040 since February 2018 and November 2018 by category (details supplied) in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":297,"content":"<p>Project Ireland 2040 is the Government's long-term, overarching strategy to make Ireland a better country for all its people, integrating, for the first time, the national spatial and investment strategies.

In addition, an applicant must have four years residence in the State during the 8 years immediately preceding that period (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years).  <\/p>  <p>  Applicants must therefore establish  that they have been resident in the State for these periods in order to be eligible for naturalisation. To this end, applicants should submit evidence with their application verifying that they satisfy the residency requirements for naturalisation. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants should also note that compliance with the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act does not automatically mean that an applicant will be granted a certificate of naturalisation as the grant of a certificate of naturalisation is, by law, discretionary. <\/p>  <p>  It is therefore very important for applicants to note that any absences from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application could result in a refusal to grant a certificate of naturalisation notwithstanding that they may have satisfied the statutory conditions for same set out in the 1956 Act. <\/p>  <p>  Where applicants are absent from the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding the date of their application the policy is to only grant a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied that the travel was demonstrably unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. Applicants who find themselves in this position should submit as much information as possible with their application to verify that any travel outside of the State in excess of six weeks during the year immediately preceding their application was unavoidable or due to exceptional circumstances. <\/p>  <p>  Every application for naturalisation is considered having regard to circumstances of the individual applicant, the statutory conditions for naturalisation set out in the 1956 Act and the policy on the need for applicants to be physically present in the State for the full duration of the year immediately preceding the date of application. <\/p>  <p>  The applications for naturalisation in respect of the persons referred to by the Deputy were reviewed and the position remains as stated in the original decision. The applicants were informed of this by letters dated 24 October 2018.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions for naturalisation prescribed in the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Nonetheless, we are working across Government to create the best environment for businesses to grow, to innovate, to be competitive and ultimately, to create jobs.<\/p>  <p>  In previous replies to the Deputy on this issue, I have set out the broad range of Brexit supports and measures put in place by Government as well as through the State Agencies under my remit, principally Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Local Enterprise\u00a0Offices and InterTradeIreland. These initiatives are all aimed at helping businesses to compete, to diversify into new\u00a0markets, to grow exports and to sustain valuable employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Budget 2020 was framed from the perspective of a No Deal Brexit. In such a scenario, my Department will have immediate access to an emergency support package of &euro;110 million. Funding will be available on day one of a crash-out to activate four specific schemes and other measures supporting those businesses most affected. The schemes will be available to vulnerable but viable firms with verifiable Brexit-exposure to help them adjust to the new trading reality and to develop new products and processes for export to new markets. <\/p>  <p>  On a positive note, our economy has performed strongly in recent years with record numbers in employment as evidenced from the latest CSO figures that puts the unemployment rate at 4.8%. However, this strong economic performance cannot be taken for granted and must evolve to meet future challenges.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  That is why, in March this year, I launched the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. This is an ambitious, medium-term framework to create a sustainable, resilient and future-oriented economy in Ireland over the years to 2025.\u00a0 Future Jobs Ireland aims to ensure that as our economy changes, and traditional industries and practices are disrupted, workers and enterprises are able to transition successfully. If we adapt now, our enterprises can stay competitive and our society resilient.<\/p>  <p>  On 7 November my Department hosted a Future Jobs Ireland Summit with two hundred attendees from enterprises, representative bodies, academia, public sector and civil\u00a0society. The aim of the Summit was for attendees to exchange ideas and input to the development of Future Jobs Ireland 2020. Along with the Department of the Taoiseach, my Department is working with other Government Departments and stakeholders to develop new commitments for Future Jobs Ireland 2020 which is expected to launch in early 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development is also a key priority for Government. The Regional Enterprise Plans to 2020 aim to continue to deliver jobs across the country, in every region, and\u00a0to address the challenges we face, including Brexit. The Plans, which are shaped from the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; by regional stakeholders, and overseen by my Department,\u00a0are crucial in meeting the Government&rsquo;s ambition to create an additional 200,000 jobs, of which 135,000 are outside the Dublin region, by 2020. <\/p>  <p>  A key objective of each of the plans is to have a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in each region by 2020, with the unemployment rate of each region within one percentage point of the national average. We want to ensure that we are creating quality jobs that are sustainable in the longer term, so that we can secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic success, in line with the Future Jobs Ireland initiative. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[48162\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ01800","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which innovation and technology continues to be a feature in the creation of new and replacement jobs in the future through innovation and technology; the degree to which she identified the full potential in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>The environment in which our enterprise must grow and thrive is changing. Technological innovation is radically transforming our lives and will continue to do so. Automation, AI and other forms of technological innovation are expected to radically change many jobs, enterprises, and entire industries. The move to a low-carbon economy will also radically change important sectors of the economy and present new opportunities to those firms on the cutting edge of this transition.<\/p><p>Technological change is already impacting several sectors, such as manufacturing, finance, retail and transport. This presents challenges but also new possibilities - certain job roles will disappear or be redefined, and brand-new job roles will appear requiring new and different skillsets. We want Ireland to be at the frontier of technological developments by rapidly adopting new technologies to boost productivity and ensure that Ireland continues to be competitive internationally. To do this, we must enable and encourage innovation across sectors and firms. Increasing investment in research, development and innovation (RD&amp;amp;I) and promoting strong links between enterprise and the research community will assist in ensuring Ireland keeps its relative advantage in the tech world and increase the pace of development of the green economy. <\/p><p>On 10 March 2019, the Government launched Future Jobs Ireland 2019, the first in a series of annual reports as part of a multi-annual framework to ensure our enterprises and workers are resilient and prepared for future challenges and opportunities. This is a whole of Government approach and forms a key part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic agenda over the medium term. <\/p><p>Future Jobs Ireland focuses on five key Pillars, namely: <\/p><p>1. Embracing Innovation and Technological Change; <\/p><p>2. Improving SME Productivity; <\/p><p>3. Enhancing Skills and Developing and Attracting Talent; <\/p><p>4. Increasing Participation in the Labour Force; and <\/p><p>5. Transitioning to a Low Carbon Economy. <\/p><p>Each Pillar sets high level targets for 2025. For Pillar 1: Embracing Innovation and Technological Change, Future Jobs Ireland is targeting an increase in Gross Expenditure on Research &amp;amp; Development intensity from 1.4% to 2.5% of GNP by 2025. It is also aiming for substantial increases in the share of SMEs introducing product or process innovations and with marketing or organisational innovations.<\/p><p>Overall, Future Jobs Ireland 2019 includes 26 meaningful and impactful ambitions supported by 127 deliverables for completion in 2019. Future Jobs Ireland is delivering on a range of Ambitions in Pillar 1: Embracing Innovation and Technological Change. These are:<\/p><p>1. Position Ireland as a leading pioneer in technology adoption by investing in demonstrator sites and developing enabling frameworks and standards <\/p><p>2. Implement a strategic approach to maximise the benefits from digitalisation<\/p><p>3. Position the Public Service to be a leader in technology adoption and innovation<\/p><p>4. Establish Top Teams to realise opportunities presented by technological changes and the move to a low carbon economy<\/p><p>5. Increase the capacity of SMEs to engage in research, development &amp;amp; innovation<\/p><p>6. Incentivise SMEs to invest in new technologies<\/p><p>7.

The four pillars span energy, water usage and conservation, waste management and plant life. <\/p><p>Bottled water coolers are typically provided across the various locations in areas which are accessed by members of the public such as reception and waiting areas, hearing rooms, meeting rooms and by Civil Service staff in our training rooms. <\/p><p>In 2019 we have reduced the number of water coolers in use across the Department offices in the Kildare Street, Dawson Street and the Earlsfort Centre buildings by over 60% and have replaced them with mains water filtration systems, where possible. <\/p><p>The Department does not purchase nor use disposable coffee cups. Staff are encouraged to use keep cups and reusable biodegradable bottles supplied by the Department. <\/p><p>Over the summer 2019, the &ldquo;Green Team&rdquo;, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, undertook some adjustment works on the water flow system underpinning the toilet facilities in the Kildare Street building. Thus far, this has yielded a significant daily saving on water usage by reducing the unaccounted for water by over 50%. We are exploring such adjustments in our other buildings. <\/p><p>In many offices we have also consolidated the use of single waste bins per staff member and moved to centralised bins per floor including enhanced recycling bins and food waste bins. This has significantly reduced the level of general waste along with plastic bags being used for waste collection.<\/p><p>More specific details on the Department&rsquo;s internal green initiatives for 2019 can be found in our Resource Efficiency Action Plan 2019 published on my Department&rsquo;s website at <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Freedom of Information Data","counter":484,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":485,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[48200\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000077#WRJ02400","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the date of each review and revision of the material published under the publication scheme of her Department as outlined in section 8 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":486,"content":"<p>The Freedom of Information publication scheme for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation was last updated and published via its website in August 2018.

HIQA is an independent authority established to drive high-quality and safe care for health and social care services in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s mandate extends across a range of public, private and voluntary sector services. Reporting to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, HIQA&rsquo;s role is to develop standards, inspect and review health and social care services and support informed decisions on how services are delivered.<\/p>  <p>  HIQA operates under the Health Act 2007, which sets out the functions which the Authority is to carry out. HIQA has responsibility for setting standards for healthcare services, and monitoring compliance with those standards. It also regulates facilities providing care for the elderly and those with disabilities, and\u00a0has a role with regard to inspecting some of the social care services which are accessed by children\u00a0to determine if they are meeting the relevant National Standards.\u00a0 Section 9 of the Act sets out the grounds under which HIQA may undertake an investigation into a particular service, or may be requested to undertake such an investigation by the Minister for Health. <\/p>  <p>  Following a statutory consultation process and\u00a0 Ministerial approval, HIQA published specific national standards for community health and social care services in Ireland (including nursing and residential homes), which cover infection prevention and control and antimicrobial stewardship.

These measures are as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - Staff report to their line manager any signs or symptoms of infection in individuals or groups of people or residents to facilitate prevention, early detection and control the spread of infection.<\/p>  <p>  - Staff know who to contact for advice in the event of a suspected or confirmed outbreak and are encouraged to ask for advice from colleagues, such as a community infection prevention and control nurse, the local Department of Public Health and or a consultant microbiologist, if uncertain about the\u00a0 best course of action.<\/p>  <p>  - Any suspected or confirmed outbreaks of infection are promptly notified to the medical officer of health in the relevant Department of Public Health, in line with legislation. Registered providers of designated centres are also required to report outbreaks of notifiable diseases to HIQA.<\/p>  <p>  - All facilities where care is delivered have a documented outbreak management plan appropriate to the services provided, detailing the action to be taken in the event of an outbreak of infection, in line with relevant national guidelines where they exist.<\/p>  <p>  - Staff clearly communicate with and support people affected by an outbreak in a timely and effective manner.<\/p>  <p>  - \u00a0All staff implement outbreak control measures as soon as possible to help reduce the impact of the outbreak. Consideration is given to the impact of visiting restrictions on residents and their families.<\/p>  <p>  - A nominated person from the residential care service liaises with specialist staff, such as the community infection prevention and control nurse and the local Department of Public Health, and provides all information necessary to assess and control the outbreak. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":534,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK01400"},{"type":"question","counter":535,"qnumday":190,"qnumall":"[47986\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the HSE monitors the number of nursing home patients, public and private, that have been vaccinated against flu; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":536,"content":"<p>Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and death.<\/p><p>As the Health Service Executive collects and collates influenza statistics, it has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[47987\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK01800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if private hospitals have been asked to vaccinate staff against the flu; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1436","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":539,"content":"<p>Vaccination remains the most effective means of preventing infection by seasonal influenza viruses and can reduce severe disease that can lead to hospitalisation and death.<\/p>  <p>  Each year the HSE reviews, and updates its influenza plans, taking into account lessons learned from previous years with a view\u00a0to targeting\u00a0key groups in order to create the greatest impact in terms of people receiving the influenza vaccine.

The Act specifies criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.<\/p><p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p><p>As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. As of October 2019, there have been 29 new medicines and 5 new indications for existing medicines approved for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.<\/p><p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.  The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p><p>  The Government wants new and innovative medicines to be available to our citizens as quickly as possible but this can only be achieved if medicines are priced by the pharmaceutical industry in a viable and sustainable manner.<\/p><p>My Department and the HSE are working on making greater efficiencies in medicines usage through a range of initiatives both domestically and internationally to ensure the greatest possible access to new treatments for patients in Ireland. <\/p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s Medicines Management Programme (MMP), incorporating the Preferred Drugs initiative, is overseeing the implementation of a number of actions to bring about greater value for the taxpayer through cost-effective provision of medicines.  These measures include the designation of preferred products with a focus on high-cost prescribing areas, in particular optimising the use of biosimilars. <\/p><p>I and officials have also been engaging over the past number of years with a number of voluntary EU forums.  In June 2018, I signed the Beneluxa Initiative on Pharmaceutical Policy. This Agreement is in line with my objective to work with other European countries to identify workable solutions, in an increasingly challenging environment, to secure timely access for patients to new medicines in an affordable and sustainable way.  In June 2019, Ireland became a Founding Member of the International Horizon Scanning Initiative which is being established as part of the work programme of Beneluxa.<\/p><p>The HSE received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) in Multiple Sclerosis.<\/p><p>  Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication. The HSE intends to progress ocrelizumab for the RMS indication, which has been approved for funding from October 2019, on a patient-specific basis for this indication.<\/p><p>  Application 2 is for the use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that Ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p><p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication. Commercial discussions have concluded and the medicine has been reviewed by the HSE Drugs Group.  The HSE Senior Leadership Team have received the Drugs Group recommendation. The HSE's final decision on reimbursement will take into consideration the criteria contained in the 2013 Health Act.<\/p><p>The HSE has also received an application for reimbursement of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol\/Cannabidiol, THC\/CBD (Sativex) which is indicated as treatment for symptom improvement in adult patients with moderate to severe spasticity due to multiple sclerosis who have not responded adequately to other anti-spasticity medication and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy. <\/p><p>The HSE commissioned a full HTA with respect to this indication in April 2018. On 25 September 2019, the NCPE received the applicant's submission and the HTA is currently underway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":555,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK03500"},{"type":"question","counter":556,"qnumday":197,"qnumall":"[48039\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000078#WRK03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of complaints of bullying and sexual harassment, respectively received by his Department in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date in 2019, in tabular form.

The Bill will include provisions to prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products, including e-cigarettes, to and by persons under 18 years and will introduce a licensing system for the retail sale of nicotine inhaling products. <\/p>  <p>  E-cigarettes are already regulated by the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 271 of 2016) which transpose EU Directive 2014\/40\/EU on Tobacco and Related Products. <\/p>  <p>  The Regulations provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. In addition, the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturer, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Regulations there must be\u00a0health warnings on packaging which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance. Finally\u00a0the Regulations prohibit advertisements for e-cigarettes on television and radio, online, and in printed publications, other than publications directed at persons in the e-cigarette industry or publications outside the EU. <\/p>  <p>  The current position on e-cigarettes is based on advice from the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in its 2017 Health Technology Assessment of Smoking Cessation Products and Services. In relation to the safety of e-cigarettes the HIQA assessment concluded that this remains an evolving area of research and that while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on long-term safety has yet to be established. <\/p>  <p>  Although the HIQA assessment was published only in 2017, in March of this year I asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence on the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. This review is expected to be completed in March 2020 and its findings will contribute to informing any additional regulation in this area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Quality","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL04900"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[48263\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the response of his Department to a recent EPA study carried out for the HSE which highlights the relationship between poor air quality, breathing conditions such as asthma and hospital admissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>Policy\u00a0responsibility for air quality is a matter for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and\u00a0Environment.<\/p><p>Air quality is an important environmental determinant of health and in this regard the HSE has a priority to identify and advise the general public on strategies to reduce their risk of adverse effects during episodes of poor air quality.\u00a0 To this end, the HSE and the EPA established a collaboration to look at the relationship\u00a0between\u00a0short-term changes in ambient air quality and hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases\u00a0in Dublin city and county between 2014 and 2018. \u00a0The Air Quality Index for Health (AQIH) was the measure used for ambient air quality (Available URL: ).<\/p><p>The preliminary findings from this work have highlighted that the ambient air quality in Dublin is predominantly good (i.e. Good: 96% ; Fair: 3% ; Poor: 1% ; and Very poor: &amp;lt; 1%).\u00a0 Other findings are comparable to reports within the literature, but uniquely show the Irish experience.<\/p><p>The report is currently being finalised for publication.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":633,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Administrative Arrangements","counter":632,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL05200"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[47884\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000079#WRL05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his plans to deal with the current and ongoing information technology problems in the payments section of his Department which is leading to ongoing delays in relation to processing files which have already been inspected and awaiting payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1342","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>EU regulations governing the administration of the Basic Payment Scheme, the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme and other area-based schemes require that full and comprehensive administrative checks, including Ground or Remote Sensing (Satellite) inspections where applicable, are fully completed to ensure eligibility with the various schemes requirements before any payments issue.

At this stage, a number of farmers are not eligible to receive payment as they have not met scheme-specific criteria.

The vast majority of land that was eligible under the existing Scheme remains eligible under the new approach. Some 700 townlands that would have previously been eligible are not eligible under the new designation. Farmers impacted financially by this change will receive a degressive phasing out payment in 2019 and 2020.

There are certain minimum numbers of inspections that must take place annually under the various schemes.  <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that in many cases, the existence of an inspection will not necessarily be delaying payment. In relation to the ANC Scheme, this scheme is subject to a range of eligibility and compliance criteria such as the requirement to meet a minimum stocking density, in addition to maintaining minimum livestock units calculated over the twelve months of the scheme year.  At this stage, a number of farmers are not eligible to receive payment as they have not met scheme-specific criteria.

It is expected that the proposed enhanced restoration and rehabilitation scheme will have benefits accruing from biodiversity provision, water quality, and increased carbon storage and sequestration. <\/p>  <p>  The proposed scheme is not a tax on carbon. It is a scheme to support biodiversity and to ensure the bogs revert to their natural state as the most efficient carbon stores. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":712,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN01500"},{"type":"question","counter":713,"qnumday":251,"qnumall":"[47942\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN01600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of staff in his Department by gender and pay grade in tabular form;

Approximately &euro;100 million has been allocated to these schemes in 2019. An overview of what is available is set out below.    The Better Energy Homes Scheme provides grants covering up to 30% of the cost of home energy upgrades. The measures covered by this scheme, such as cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, solar thermal, heating controls and a BER certificate, were expanded over the last year to include deeper measures such as external wall insulation and heat pumps. &euro;22 million was allocated in 2019 with 14,361 homes receiving funding for upgrades to end of October.<\/p>  <p>  The Better Energy Warmer Homes Scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households who meet the defined eligibility criteria and who are vulnerable to energy poverty. The measures were expanded in 2018 to include internal and external insulation. In 2019, &euro;39.8 million was allocated to the scheme with 2,891 homes upgraded by end of October.<\/p>  <p>  The Better Energy Communities Scheme funds community based partnerships to improve the energy efficiency of the building stock in their area &ndash; homes, including those at risk of energy poverty, community facilities and businesses. It also encourages innovative measures and solutions. These partnerships can be between the public and private sectors, domestic and non-domestic sectors, commercial and not-for-profit organisations and energy suppliers. The scheme leverages considerable additional private investment. In 2019, &euro;23 million was allocated to the scheme, with 57 projects granted approval including 685 homes.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan has committed to increasing the scale and depth of retrofit activity in order to meet our emissions reduction targets from the Built Environment. This will involve 500,000 homes being upgraded to a BER B2\/cost optimal or carbon equivalent by 2030. A Retrofit Taskforce, chaired by my Department, is driving the achievement of this target. A key part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s work will be designing a national retrofit delivery model that groups homes together to achieve economies of scale and provides smart financing options and easy pay back methods. Achievement of this target will be supported by the Project Ireland 2040 allocation of &euro;3.7 billion as well as the range of measures identified in the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2020 has allocated &euro;146 million for retrofitting homes and businesses which will support the upgrade of 24,000 properties in 2020. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Recruitment","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN02700"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[48060\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN02800","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the estimated full-year cost of recruiting three extra whole-time equivalent petroleum exploration specialists in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table.  <table>    <tr>       <th>Grade<\/th>       <th>Estimated Gross Annual Salary Cost (1st Point of PPC Scale )<\/th>       <th>No. of Grade<\/th>       <th>Total Gross Cost<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Petroleum Exploration Specialists<\/td>       <td>&euro;78,790.00<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>&euro;236,370<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>My Department does not currently have Petroleum Exploration Specialists vacancies and does not currently plan recruitment at this grade.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Staff Data","counter":727,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN03000"},{"type":"question","counter":728,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[48067\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN03100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of employees of his Department that were dismissed in each of the years 2016 to 2018 and to date 2019; the reason for the dismissal of each employee; the number of employees suspended in the same period; and the reason for the suspension of each in tabular form.","asker":"1218","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":729,"content":"<p>There have been no employees dismissed or suspended by my Department from 2016 to date.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":730,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN03300"},{"type":"question","counter":731,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[48119\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000081#WRN03400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the amount spent on public relations, promotion and advertising for the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and Project Ireland 2040 since its publication in February 2018 by category (details supplied) in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":732,"content":"<p>Expenditure by my Department on public relations, promotion and advertising on the National Development Plan as part of Project Ireland 2040, is detailed by category in the table below:  <table>    <tr>       <th>Expenditure from February 2018 to date<\/th>       <th>Amount (incl.

As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party.  My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  On 9th October, my Department issued Marine Notice 42 of 2019, to provide key stakeholders with a brief overview of some of the main changes that will come into effect once the draft legislation has been finalised.  Summarising the provisions of Article 6 of the Annex to Council Directive (EU) 2017\/159, Marine Notice 42 of 2019 states that, &ldquo;fishers who are 16 or 17 years of age may perform duties provided that they are no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling, they have completed a basic pre-sea training course, their mental and physical well-being is fully protected and they have received adequate instruction&rdquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The requirement to complete a basic pre-sea training course is a long established practice. Under the provisions of S.I. No. 587\/2001 Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations, 2001, a new entrant, defined as &ldquo;a person who is for the first time gainfully employed or engaged as a crew member&rdquo; must complete a safety training course before proceeding to sea. Bord Iascaigh Mhara provides Basic Safety Training for new entrants. In keeping with the requirements of S.I. No. 587\/2001, the training consists of three elements: Personal Survival Techniques (STCW-95 Certificate), Elementary First Aid (STCW-95 Certificate) and Fire Prevention and Safety Awareness.<\/p>  <p>  More generally in relation to the safety of workers, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and its subsidiary regulations cover all workers, irrespective of age or work activity. There is a statutory responsibility for a risk assessment to be carried and maintained and that safety controls are set out in the employer&rsquo;s legally required safety statement. Where the employer&rsquo;s risk assessment finds that only light work on fishing vessels can be done safely by anyone over 15 and under 18, then it is the employer's legal responsibility to ensure that such a limitation on the work and workers is imposed. <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that Part 6, Chapter 1 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 299 of 2007), relating to the protection of children and young persons, includes provisions around the employer carrying out risk assessments to determine any specific risks to the safety, health and welfare of children (under 16) and young persons (under 18) arising from how work is carried out. Any such risk assessment should be sufficiently robust to determine if the work involved is beyond the physical or psychological capacity of the child or young person, and take account of the use of harmful substances, extremes of heat, cold, noise or vibration in the work which a child\/young person may not recognize as risks. It should be noted that this legislation falls under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Projects Status","counter":759,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO01000"},{"type":"question","counter":760,"qnumday":269,"qnumall":"[47883\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if a feasibility study has been carried out into the prospect of a bypass road project for Castlemartyr, County Cork; if not, his plans to request such a study and to implement measures to address congestion in the town which has become a major problem with over half a million vehicles passing through Castlemartyr per month.","asker":"1279","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":761,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme.

This was achieved through bye-laws enacted under Part 19 of the Local Government Act 2001; that legislation provides a general power to a local authority to make bye-laws in relation to its own property or services or to regulate matters of local concern.  It is under this Act that local authorities can choose, using bye-laws, to regulate horse-drawn carriages that operate for hire or reward within their functional area.  These bye-laws allow relevant local authorities to set their own rules and stipulations to govern such operations.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018 DCC became aware that - specifically in relation to Dublin - this legal basis for making such bye-laws could be uncertain.  Local authorities may not make bye-laws for purposes provided for elsewhere in legislation.  And the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 had previously vested the power to regulate horse-drawn carriages in Dublin with the Dublin Metropolitan Police Commissioners, to whom An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the successor. <\/p>  <p>  My Department examined this issue and, following legal advice, is now of the view that the Dublin Carriage Acts 1853-55 remain in force and preclude DCC from enacting the relevant bye-laws.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand that DCC first became aware of the present legal issues during a routine review of the bye-laws that considered, inter alia, whether there was need to strengthen measures to safeguard the welfare of horses used to draw carriages. Furthermore, the Control of Horses Act 1996 allows local authorities to introduce bye-laws designating certain areas as control areas for horses. Dublin City Council has designated its administrative boundaries as such a control area under its Control of Horses Bye-Laws 2014. These bye-laws require horses to be licensed and set minimum standards for the keeping of horses within the control area. <\/p>  <p>  Regulations for horse-drawn carriages for hire or reward should be aligned with any horse welfare obligations imposed by local authorities. Accordingly, I have formed the view that horse-drawn carriages for hire and reward should be regulated by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  This is a complex issue which spans the responsibilities of several Departments and levels of government. Accordingly, my Department is working with colleagues across Government, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, to identify how best to empower Dublin City Council to regulate this matter in Dublin, just as other local authorities regulate this matter elsewhere in the country.  This work is progressing and I expect to be in a position to bring legislative proposals to Government for approval before the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":768,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO01900"},{"type":"question","counter":769,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[47891\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000082#WRO02000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the way in which the public consultation process conducted by BusConnects was advertised; if he is satisfied that enough consultation was conducted with communities within the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":770,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

The short and long term effects of homelessness on children are well documented. While Tusla does not have a direct role in the provision of housing or accommodation for homeless families a range of services, from prevention and early intervention through to child welfare and protection, are provided.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla works in partnership with the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) and is a key partner on several interagency groups. Bilateral meetings between the DRHE and Tusla take place monthly. Tusla supports &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; assessment centres being led by the DRHE. Tusla staff participate as required on issues involving child protection and welfare, educational welfare and Domestic, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (DSGBV) services. The Tusla Homelessness Liaison Officer plays a key role in coordinating this multi-agency response.<\/p>  <p>  While homelessness is not a reason for a referral to child protection services, there may be child protection or welfare concerns for some children. Tusla undertakes visits to Family Hubs and emergency accommodation providers to ensure that they are aware of their requirements under Children First and to clarify referral queries. Tusla has progressed plans for the linkage of Child and Family Support Networks (CFSNs) with family hubs and other homeless accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Tusla also works in partnership with a number of Family Resource Centres (FRCs) to provide dedicated services for families experiencing homelessness. Tusla has also supported the evening service at the Focus Ireland Coffee Shop, a service which includes a range of supports to homeless families, high quality food, and rooms for children to do homework supported by an educational tutor. Tusla also funds the work of two child support workers in Focus Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is important to note that the needs of homeless families require a response from across Government and beyond. I have asked that Tusla provide further detail in regard to family support workers directly to the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000083#WRP04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000083#WRP04400"},{"type":"question","counter":854,"qnumday":300,"qnumall":"[48118\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000083#WRP04500","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount spent on public relations, promotion and advertising for the National Development Plan 2018-2027 and Project Ireland 2040 since its publication in February 2018 by category (details supplied) in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":855,"content":"<p>The information sought by the Deputy is currently being collated and the response will issue as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000083#WRP04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"question","counter":857,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[48184\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000083#WRP04800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the amount spent on bottled water and disposable coffee cups by her Department to date in 2019; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":858,"content":"<p>My Department has spent approximately &euro;8,600 on bottled water and water coolers so far in 2019.

is\u00a0available at\u00a0, explored the avenues and impediments to participation in the scheme and recommended a number of actions to make the scheme work better for borrowers.\u00a0 My Department and the Housing Agency has worked with all stakeholders to\u00a0ensure that the actions set out in the Review are effectively implemented\u00a0to benefit a greater number of households.\u00a0 In that context, the eligibility requirements of the scheme were widened to include a greater number of borrowers and a larger number of property types.\u00a0 Increasing awareness and understanding of the scheme has been a priority and a new website,\u00a0www.mortgagetorent.ie,\u00a0dedicated to guiding and advising borrowers has been developed.\u00a0 In addition, new structures and arrangements have been put in place to encourage a greater number of entities to take part in the scheme.<\/p><p>While it will continue to be the case that not all MTR applications will\u00a0progress into\u00a0completed transactions for varied reasons,\u00a0the implementation of the resulting actions from the Review means that MTR\u00a0is available to provide\u00a0a long-term solution for more households in mortgage distress, where appropriate.\u00a0<\/p><p>My focus, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as many households as possible remain in their homes and I would encourage borrowers to engage with the Abhaile Service, the national mortgage arrears resolution service,\u00a0which is available\u00a0free of charge to the borrower.\u00a0 The unique element of Abhaile is that it brings together, for the first\u00a0time, the full range of supports and services required by\u00a0borrowers in home mortgage arrears.\u00a0 A dedicated adviser will work with the borrower and their lender to find the best\u00a0solution for their particular situation.\u00a0 MABS act as the gateway for the service and can be contacted by telephoning (076)1072000 or by accessing their website at:\u00a0www.mabs.ie\/abhaile.<\/p><p>For those borrowers in danger of losing their home who are ineligible for the MTR scheme but qualify for social housing support, it is recommended that they engage as early as possible with their local authority regarding their long-term housing needs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112000085#WRR05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local

significant housing access and affordability challenges, the Government is committed to the introduction of a Cost Rental sector in Ireland.\u00a0My Department is currently developing a national policy approach for this new form of rental tenure. This work includes the development of\u00a0two pathfinder projects on local authority-owned sites, from which lessons will be drawn\u00a0to inform\u00a0an optimum model for Cost Rental\u00a0delivery at the national level.<\/p>  <p>  The first of these projects in Enniskerry Road, is currently under construction. Work on\u00a0this development of 155 units began in\u00a0July 2019.\u00a0 It comprises 105 homes for social housing and 50\u00a0two bedroomed Cost Rental homes. \u00a0The Cost Rental units, which\u00a0are scheduled for completion in 2021, will be offered for rental at &euro;1,200 per month.\u00a0Land for the development\u00a0is being provided by Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council to help achieve these competitive rents, which represent a very\u00a0significant reduction when compared with market rents in the Stepaside area. My Department is also providing &euro;4.5 million is Serviced Sites Funding to support\u00a0infrastructure costs associated with the development.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The other pathfinder project is at Emmet Road in Inchicore, including the site of the former St Michael's Estate. Dublin City Council, the site owner, is continuing to make progress on the\u00a0design and planning work for this project. DCC has appointed a dedicated project manager and a project team to move the project forward, and a development framework plan has recently been completed. It is projected that the site can accommodate 484 homes in a high-quality mixed tenure development, including 375 Cost Rental apartments. The\u00a0remaining units will be\u00a0provided for\u00a0social housing. DCC is engaging with my Department according to the best practice guidelines set out in the Capital Works Management Framework, and is procuring an architect-led integrated design team which will be responsible for designing the scheme and taking it as far as the planning stage.  I am determined that work will continue to progress at pace on this project and that lessons learned from the financial modelling for this location are applied more broadly.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the Cost Rental agenda more generally,\u00a0the development of a national policy\u00a0approach is being progressed by working group led by my Department and also involving the Land Development Agency, the Housing Agency, and other bodies. This will provide for a sustainable financing structure and allow us to commence the delivery of Cost Rental homes at scale.  Detailed operational and eligibility criteria for Cost Rental will be informed by this evidence building and policy work.

The National Student Accommodation Strategy was subsequently launched in July 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills in conjunction with Action 4.07 of Rebuilding Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  Identified measures in assisting the development of new student accommodation projects included reforms related to planning matters and to development finance which were then provided for in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. Firstly, under Action 4.13, the fast tracking of planning applications for construction projects with more than 200 student bedspaces was created under the Strategic Housing Development (SHD) route directly to An Bord Pleanala. <\/p>  <p>  As of the end October 2019, this has resulted in the granting of planning permissions for 7,573 student bedspaces nationally under the SHD procedure. In addition, legislative provisions (Action 4.11) were also created to facilitate financing from the Housing Finance Agency to the Higher Education Institutes, specifically for new student accommodation projects. <\/p>  <p>  There has been a sustained increase in the planning and construction of purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) nationally since the adoption of Rebuilding Ireland in 2016. As of the end of Q3, 2019, a total of 8,229 bed spaces have been completed since the adoption of Rebuilding Ireland.  This delivery exceeds the objective under Action 4.08 of Rebuilding Ireland to bring on stream 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there are a further 5,254 bed spaces on site and plans approved for an additional 7,771 bed spaces, representing a total of 21,254 bed spaces either complete, under construction or with plans granted at the end of Q3 2019 which indicates a strong pipeline of new student housing construction projects to continue growth to 2021 and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  Action 4.07 of Rebuilding Ireland referred to the scope for the provision of student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands. Circular letter PL8\/2016 to local authorities encouraged their collaboration with the Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) in developing student accommodation projects. To this end the &lsquo;State Lands Map&rsquo; was also published on the Rebuilding Ireland website in 2017 and this resource provides details and mapping of state owned lands including those controlled by the local authorities and the Housing Agency.  The HEIs have been made aware of this resource through the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Student Accommodation established by the Department of Education and Skills and many are progressing plans to develop student accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  Efforts to expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector are identified in Action 4.10. My Department has provided funding of &euro;130,000 in the 2016-19 period to the Union of Students in Ireland in this regard to assist in funding a Student Housing Officer, training and other activities such as the #homesforstudy campaign. This initiative involves a website and other initiatives to encourage homeowners in targeted locations across the country to earn up to &euro;14,000 tax free under the rent-a-room scheme by accommodating a student. <\/p>  <p>  An additional provision has also been made for the UCD Students Union, who are outside the USI. A submission for further funding for the 2019\/20 academic year has been made by the USI jointly to the Department of Education and Skills and my Department including proposals for continuing the #homesforstudy.ie campaign and other activities in the student accommodation area.

The Report of the Review Group was received on 24 September 2019.\u00a0 The Report acknowledges that the SHD arrangements have generally been a success in meeting their objectives to contribute to addressing housing undersupply issues by providing a fast-track development consent process aimed at incentivising developers to bring forward applications for large-scale housing developments. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the positive contribution that the SHD arrangements have made, the Review Group notes that there continues to exist a deficit in housing supply and affirms that the original rationale for the introduction of the SHD arrangements remains. In light of these findings, the Review Group considers that there are sufficient grounds for extending the SHD arrangements until the end of 2021. <\/p>  <p>  I concur with the finding of the Review Group in this regard and propose to shortly sign an order to this effect.

For the Deputy's convenience the relevant material is set out as follows.<\/p><p>In  2017 expenditure of &euro;64,167 was incurred in respect of social media relating to the  Creative Ireland programme.  This arose from a comprehensive citizen engagement programme to showcase the range and depth of Ireland's cultural and creative offering and to encourage participation in arts and creative activities as a means of individual, collective and societal well-being.  The vision of the Creative Ireland Programme is that every person in Ireland should have the opportunity to realise their full creative potential.  This represents a new approach to creativity and cultural policy and therefore required a sustained communications programme in 2017.  A combination of approaches and platforms were used to maximise impact, taking account of the diversity of the target audiences.  Further information is available on my Department's Creative Ireland website.<\/p><p>During 2018 Creative Ireland undertook a four week campaign from mid-May to mid-June 2018 on regional radio and social media  to promote the 500 events taking place across the country as part of the inaugural Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g day of creativity for children and young people.  Three bespoke videos were produced to support and raise awareness of Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g - Ireland's new national day of Creativity for children and young people - at a cost of &euro;24,815.<\/p><p>In addition to promoting interest in specific initiatives such as Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, social media is also actively used to support and promote the Creative Ireland Programme generally as well as specific creative endeavours and partner activities.  During 2018, specific short videos were also commissioned to promote various aspects or pillars of the Creative Ireland Programme. These included a specially commissioned spoken word piece by Stephen James Smith to mark the publication of 31 Local Authority Culture and Creativity Strategies in September accompanied by five short videos to illustrate the breadth and range of activities supported by the local authority Creative Ireland Programmes; and a video to mark the roll out of the Creative Schools initiative in 150 schools nationwide, in partnership with the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Skills. <\/p><p>  All these videos are available at www.creativeireland.gov.ie\/en.  <\/p><p>  A full breakdown of all costs in 2018 in relation to these activities is published on the Creative Ireland Website. <table>    <tr>       <th>Creative Ireland Expenditure Summary <\/th>       <th>2018 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g <\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Regional radio &amp;amp; social media campaign <\/td>       <td>&euro;48,780 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>3 Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g videos <\/td>       <td>&euro;24,815 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Creative Ireland Programme  <\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Social Media content - uploading of articles daily throughout 2018 <\/td>       <td>&euro;66,420 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>12 videos <\/td>       <td>&euro;93,110 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>I am also advised that the Culture Ireland Unit of my Department engaged Mr. Nik Quaife on a 1 year contract for the provision of services including a communications strategy for its GB18 programme, to celebrate and renew Ireland&rsquo;s cultural relationship with Britain.
