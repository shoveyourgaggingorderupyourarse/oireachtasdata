Some 47,753 reviews, involving more than half of all pensioners identified for review, had been completed by 23 May last.  On foot of those reviews, some 23,521 pensioners have received an increase\u00a0in their rate of weekly pension and 24,232 have remained on their existing rate of payment.

It appears now that slightly fewer than half of the reviews conducted to date have resulted in increased pension payments.

While there are people who have not got an uplift as a result of this approach to making an amount of money people available to people through their pensions, I remind the House that these payments are based on people's contribution histories.  We cannot give someone a contribution history that he or she does not have.  The 20-year home-caring credit we introduced into the total contribution approach in 2012 is probably the most generous home-caring credit across Europe, rightly so because it is deserved.

Any change in the\u00a0current process of\u00a0setting social welfare payment rates, including the establishment of\u00a0a commission, would need to be\u00a0considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.

As the Deputy will be aware, the road map for pensions reform, which was published last year, commits the Government and all future Governments to examine and develop proposals to set a formal benchmark target of 34% of average earnings for the State contributory pension and provides that a process will be instituted to ensure future changes in pension payment rates are explicitly linked with changes in average wages and prices.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is considering the options open to it as it seeks to make progress with this commitment, including the suggestion made by the Deputy.  It has consulted a range of stakeholders, as required under section 19 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018, on the examination of the ways in which social welfare rates are determined now and will be determined in the future.  The feedback from this consultation is being considered and will help us to inform the development of our approach to benchmarking and indexation.

All the spokespeople in this area will be invited to the forum and I hope they will attend.

All of those issues have been addressed.  Thankfully, the latest data from the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, show that the poverty rate has dropped by a significant 2%.  There is still a tremendous number of people who are within the percentages of living close to or on the poverty line, and we will continue to work on ensuring we drive payments towards the people who are most in need.

It is a condition for receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance that the carer must be providing\u00a0full-time care and attention\u00a0for a person who requires such full-time care and attention because of a specified illness or disability.

Depending on the scheme, targets for awarding claims are set between ten and 12 weeks.  Disability allowance claims took an average of 13 weeks to award, which is a week outside of our targeted timeframe.<\/p>  <p>  There is more complexity attached to the processing of applications for the means-tested schemes.  Schemes relying on medical evidence also require greater time to process than some of our other claims.  In disability allowance claims, for example, in addition to providing evidence of habitual residence in the State and of the income and assets the applicants may hold, they must provide details of their medical conditions and the extent to which they restrict them from taking up employment.  The information provided is then assessed by a qualified medical assessor, and this takes some time.  In many cases, where a medical assessor deems that the person is not restricted in his or her capacity to take up work, the person concerned then submits additional information in the hope of supporting his or her claim.  The time taken to receive and then assess this additional information is also reflected in our processing times.  Likewise, for carer's allowance, details of the income and assets of the claimant, together with medical certification identifying the care needs of the person being cared for on a full-time basis, also need to be provided and assessed.<\/p>  <p>  I reassure the Deputy that claim processing is kept under - I will not say \"daily\" - weekly review because not only is the matter raised here all the time by all parties and none, but it is also something to which we strive.  No one wants to set out to frustrate people who are only coming to us because they have genuine needs or are at low periods in their lives or to make the process more difficult than it is.  The reflections on how we are approaching our new carer's payment application - we have done extensive work with the Carers Association and other carers' representative bodies to try to make that application process simpler for those who apply - is only one of the small ways in which we are trying to improve the way we do things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000008#F00700","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1559211300,"counter":71,"content":"<p>We have all been on the doorsteps, around DART stations and so on in recent weeks.  We hear many horror stories in particular about waiting times for carer's allowance and even at times for carer's benefit, which Deputy Penrose and I worked on in earlier D&aacute;ileanna to get it introduced.  I think the Minister told us there is a very high number of applications for carer's allowance.  I think there were something like 15,500 applications and nearly 18,000 for disability allowance between January and September last year.  Is the number of applications more or less consistent in demographic terms or is the Department tending to get more and more applications for the key allowances I mentioned?  The Minister made the point to a number of us in response to an earlier question that about 85% of claims, I think, are awarded and appeals are made by just 1% of those refused.  At the same time, though, some of the waiting times for oral appeal hearings are incredible.  In the case of carer's allowance, one must wait 28.4 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.3 weeks for a summary decision.  The position is very similar in the case of carer's benefit and disability allowance, at 17.1 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively.  It was our ambition in previous eras to have an independent statutory process for appeals.

There are some 2,770 people in receipt of carer's benefit giving care to 3,185 people.  The average processing time for carer's benefit is 11 weeks.  The average processing time for carer's allowance was 17.3 weeks and as of the end of April this year it is down to 12 weeks.  I will give the Deputy all these statistics instead of just standing here and reading them out to him.  I know how frustrating this is but it is equally frustrating to us.  We will potentially have staff freed up from illness benefit, for example, arising from the extra staff we allocated to that section.  When we have staff freed up from certain schemes, we put them in the areas that are most in need.  I hope people can see that the numbers are coming down.  The waiting times for domiciliary care allowance, DCA, applications have reduced drastically.  The waiting times for carer's allowance and carer's benefit are reducing.  Even 12 weeks is probably sometimes a little long, but we set the targets for a reason: we want to achieve them.

Those submissions outlined the individual views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them.  Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, we are now designing the scheme and I intend to bring a proposal to Cabinet shortly with the design for approval, please God.  When and if the Government approves the approach, I will publish it and we will publish the legislation that will be required to bring in this reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000010#H01200","speaker":"1338"},{"type":"speech","time":1559212500,"counter":117,"content":"<p>As we are at the end of quarter 2 of 2019, it is an ambitious programme to start implementation in quarter 3 of 2020, especially in the light of the fact that the scheme requires underpinning by legislation.

This measure is only part of the Government's stated aim of creating what should be a supportive environment for entrepreneurship, including providing an income safety net to both employees and self-employed persons.  The scheme will be introduced in November 2019.  It builds on other significant improvements for self-employed persons in recent years, such as giving people access to invalidity pension and treatment benefits from 2017, both of which have been highly successful.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the features of the existing jobseeker's benefit scheme will apply to the new scheme, such as its duration and rate of payment.  Applicants will have to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the new scheme, including PRSI requirements.  The statutory conditions for the scheme are being finalised by officials at this time as part of the legislative process.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the rates of PRSI.  Self-employed persons pay a personal rate of social insurance that is exactly the same as that paid by people who are employed.  There is, however, no equivalent to the employer contribution paid in respect of people in normal paid employment.  The question, therefore, is whether a self-employed person, for example, a painter, electrician or carpenter, should, in addition to having to pay the personal rate, also pay the employer rate.  My view is that introducing an additional charge of approximately 10% on self-employed persons is not a decision that anyone should take lightly.  I am minded that most self-employed persons are not rolling in money.  They are not high earners.  Most only earn in or around the average industrial wage and are involved in trades or personal services, such as taxi services.  On the other hand, I am also minded that the differential in contribution rates can give rise to unwelcome behaviours.  Such behaviours were highlighted in the conversation we had about bogus self-employment.  Therefore, while I have no immediate plans to apply an employer contribution to self-employed earnings, I am genuinely open to suggestions and to reflecting on how some other European countries and Canadian provinces have addressed this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The question of how best to fund the Social Insurance Fund will be raised in a consultation paper.  This issue will become more pertinent as the years go by.  We know that if we do nothing, the Social Insurance Fund will run into trouble in the coming years.  At the back of my mind is a contractors' tax, as implemented in Ontario or Portugal.

The figures are significant and the benefits will be paid at the maximum rate of &euro;203 for those who qualify under the dependant rate and the child dependant rate of &euro;34.

The issue is that in order to extend it the Government will have to find some other source of income and PRSI payment.  A conversation will have to be had and we will have to examine other areas.

There are new and emerging models, such as a new PRSI charge payable in respect of dependent self-employed persons who are entirely different from a painter, plumber or taxi driver.

That was based on figures from 2012.  Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and other Departments, is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty and also other forms of poverty.  One Department will not be successful on its own.  Meeting the target set means reducing the number of children in consistent poverty to 37,000 or fewer by 2020.

An Teachta Pearse Doherty has previously raised the case of a soft play centre in Donegal which saw its premiums rise by 160% last year from &euro;2,500 in 2017 to &euro;6,500 in 2018.

Its absence and the revenue that it generates for Rush and the surrounding area will be a major loss.<\/p>  <p>  This is a really serious issue.  Some of this is down to fraud.  I accept that.  Fraud and bogus claims are definitely a problem.  I raised this issue here yesterday and repeat the call that has been made on numerous occasions for the establishment of a Garda insurance fraud unit to help stamp out fraudulent claims.  However, more of this is down to blind profiteering on the part of the insurance industry and that must be stamped out also.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure this happens we need a real commitment from the industry that price reductions will accompany reforms and we need to see proposed reforms as soon as possible.

We have to reduce our carbon emissions by half by 2030, from 60 million tonnes to 33 million tonnes.  Not all parts of the economy will transform at the same speed.  Some changes are easier to achieve, and for us to envisage.  Wind energy generation fits Ireland's natural advantages and I am confident that the right combination of public and private investment can ensure we meet the ambitious targets of 70% of renewables in electricity by 2030.  By 2050, we should also be generating 100% renewable electricity, with excess energy being exported via the links to Britain and France.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, transforming to a low-energy economy in other sectors will be more challenging.  Local government could lead the way on sustainability through its role in terms of planning and developing local government and local area plans.  As an immediate first step, all local authorities should be required to measure accurately and report annually on their carbon footprints, from the buildings they occupy, to their housing stock, to their vehicles and on to all their various other activities.  Local authorities should set ambitious targets in order that they can experiment, be incentivised to try out new technologies, learn best practice and consider what is best international practice.  This research and development at local authority level would help build up a pool of expertise that we need to impact across the economy.  Local authorities should take the lead.  They could discover new ways that work in building technologies, planning, sustainable settlements, electric and biodiesel vehicles, retrofitting, electric-heating technology, solar panels, etc.<\/p>  <p>  All public buildings should be retrofitted as a matter of priority.  All local authority housing should be next.  That would give rise to a significant improvement.  It would reduce fuel poverty by ensuring that people have modernised homes that they can afford to keep warm.  We should be aiming to retrofit 100,000 homes annually.  That is hugely ambitious but if we have the will, it can be achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Government agree that all local authorities should aim to set net targets of being carbon neutral by 2030 in terms of their own carbon footprints?

Tackling the climate disruption issue is the greatest challenge that humanity faces.  It will pose major challenges, globally as well as here at home, if we fail to deliver.  The sad reality is that since the economic recovery started, we have failed to break the link between carbon and growing prosperity.  We have a great deal of work to do in order to catch up.<\/p>  <p>  I have prepared a detailed climate action plan which will address every sector of the economy.  It will look at buildings, transport, agriculture and industry.  It will deliver in the area of renewable electricity, increasing our ambition to move to using 70% renewables.  Previously, that ambition was to get to 55%.  We will implement the changes.  Like the Deputy, I believe local authorities and all public bodies will be pivotal to delivering this.  It is absolutely essential that the Government and all bodies lead by example, not only in the context of their own direct carbon impact but also by motivating the many people whose lives they touch to help them make the changes that are necessary to achieve this target.<\/p>  <p>  We will have a plan that respects the large level of consensus that was achieved within the Oireachtas and that will build on that foundation that has been laid by the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee.

We know that if we are to do that and stop runaway dangerous climate change, which will ruin everyone's future, we have to keep four fifths of the known fossil fuel reserves - that is, reserves that have been discovered - in the ground.  We know that if that is the case, the last thing we should be doing is looking for more oil and gas, in particular in hazardous and expensive environments like the deep Atlantic.  We know that we have gone out about 160 times and found three pockets of gas in the last 30 to 40 years of looking, using up massive amounts of speculative money in that process.  We know that even if we found something far out on the Porcupine, several hundred kilometres away from our shore, the likelihood of it being landed on our shores is minimal.  The distances are so great that it would be cheaper, easier and less contentious to ship it into some refinery harbour elsewhere.  It, therefore, gives us no real security.<\/p>  <p>  We know that we have huge potential if we put all the civil servants who are working on this together with all that Irish Stock Exchange money and speculative engineering into the development of offshore wind energy projects, where we have massive comparative competitive advantage, we really could provide an energy power supply for the future.

The only way that we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels is by reducing the 84% current dependence.  We use only 16% renewables.  The rest is coming from fossil fuels.  We need to develop real policies that will see a shift in our dependence on fossil fuels, in electricity, transport, heat and in all those other sectors that use them.  I have committed to 70% renewables for electricity.  That will need huge changes in access, for example, for offshore wind energy to the grid.  We will be making the necessary legislative, consenting and support changes required to achieve this.<\/p>  <p>  Let us be absolutely honest with people.  Preventing new domestic sources of gas being found will not reduce our greenhouse emissions by 1 g.  That is the reality.  All it will do is that it will change our dependence on domestic sourced gas to dependence on overseas gas or overseas oil.  The impact of reduced exploration, if it is to be achieved in higher oil prices, which I presume is the Deputy's objective, will mean that we will be paying more to sheiks in Saudi Arabia or oligarchs in Russia.  We have other tools to bring up the price of fossil fuels and influence the decisions that people make through a carbon price.  If we apply a carbon price, the revenue from that money will come back to the Exchequer to be used to do the things Deputy Howlin pointed out that we need to do.  We have methods to address this, through both incentives to people to change and to develop the technologies and strategies that are necessary.  <\/p>  <p>  It is worth bearing in mind that the Citizens' Assembly did not recommend that this be adopted and it was not one of its recommendations.  It is not in the Oireachtas committee's report.  It is not in those documents for a good reason.  We need real policies to change this.  The only countries which have taken the position Deputy Eamon Ryan is advocating for Ireland are France, with its huge nuclear resource, and New Zealand, with its huge geothermal and hydro resources.  We do not have those resources.  We are 84% dependent on fossil fuels and, therefore, have to develop a pathway that is consistent with the challenges we face.  In the short to medium term, it is best that while we remain highly dependent on fossil fuels, we should minimise our dependence on imported resources.<\/p><p>Where we can supplement the resources coming from the Corrib field, it would be a good outcome to do so.

Europe has changed all the rules in order to ensure there is security in both of those markets.  Oil does not come with an Irish flag or any other flag attached; it is sold in an internationally-traded market and shipped around the world.

There is a determined effort, both by SOLAS and by the Department of Education and Skills, to have better pathways into apprenticeships.

Last month, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann declared a national biodiversity crisis.  It is up to us, as legislators, to act and to live up to the scale of action needed to tackle the crisis we are facing and it is up to the Government to change tack, take the protection and preservation of our natural world seriously and tackle this biodiversity crisis head on.<\/p><p>On 8 May 2019, the National Parks and Wildlife Service released Ireland's sixth national report to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.  There is currently no mention of this report on the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht's website.  The report shows that we are still failing to halt the loss of our nature.  It states that In Ireland, 91% of protected habitats are in poor or inadequate condition and more than 50% are declining.  In addition, 14% of species assessed are considered to be endangered.  The report states unequivocally that a &quot;transformational change is required&quot; to achieve the vision set out in the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021 that &quot;biodiversity and ecosystems in Ireland are conserved and restored, delivering benefits essential for all sectors of society&quot;.  It continues:<\/p><blockquote>Although better conservation designations have been put in place and improved environmental management has been adopted, the mainstreaming of biodiversity has yet to amount to a fully integrated approach.  It is unclear if the greater consideration being given to sustainability and biodiversity in sectoral policy is sufficient to turn around the continuing degradation of habitat and species populations, and the threats to key ecosystem services.<\/blockquote><p>It is clear from reading this that the Government is simply not doing enough.  This is damning stuff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It is basically saying business as usual is killing off wildlife.<\/p><p>Ireland was among 130 members represented at the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, plenary meeting, which took place in Paris recently, and at which the IPBES global assessment was approved.  Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries in the past three years, with inputs from another 310 contributing authors, the report assesses changes over the past five decades, providing a comprehensive picture of the relationship between economic development pathways and their impact on nature.  It also offers a range of possible scenarios for the coming decades.  Based on the systematic review of approximately 15,000 scientific and government sources, the report also draws, for the first time ever on this scale, on indigenous and local knowledge, and addresses in particular issues relevant to indigenous peoples and local communities.  According to the IPBES report, three quarters of the land-based environment and approximately 66% of the marine environment have been significantly altered by human actions.  On average, these trends have been less severe or avoided in areas held or managed by indigenous peoples and local communities.<\/p><p>In 2015, 33% of marine fish stocks were being harvested at unsustainable levels.  Some 60% were maximally sustainably fished, with just 7% harvested at levels lower than what can be sustainably fished.  Plastic pollution has increased tenfold since 1980, with between 300 million and 400 million tonnes of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and other wastes from industrial facilities being dumped annually into the world&rsquo;s waters.  Fertilisers entering coastal ecosystems have produced more than 400 ocean dead zones, totalling more than 245,000 sq. km, a combined area greater than the United Kingdom.<\/p><p>The entire natural world is in crisis, yet last year the Government passed the slash and burn Heritage Act, which will have devastating impacts on wildlife on uplands and in hedgerows.  The wildlife in our seas is in great danger too.  The Irish Wildlife Trust&rsquo;s 2018 report shows that 48 species indigenous to Irish waters are facing extinction.  The Government&rsquo;s INFOMAR and ObSERVE programmes have found even more of a wealth of species off our coasts.  The ObSERVE programme found a dolphin population off Ireland&rsquo;s coast in winter that is larger than the entire known population of dolphins in the world.  Recently, the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group tracked a humpback whale from County Kerry feeding near the Porcupine Basin to Cape Verde in north-west Africa.  It took the group 16 years to do so.  Ireland is a feeding ground for dolphins, blue whales and humpback whales and many more species from all over the globe.  We do not know where their breeding grounds are.  This information highlights that we know next to nothing about what we are destroying off our coasts.<\/p><p>That brings me to the dangers of seismic testing to explore for oil and gas off the Irish coast.  To map the seabed for fossil fuel deposits, sonic cannons, also known as seismic airguns, are towed behind boats creating dynamite-like blasts, repeated every ten seconds, 24 hours a day, for weeks and months at a time, at acoustic levels 100,000 times more intense than a jet engine.  Seismic airgun testing increased dramatically from 2013 onwards.  Noise from a single seismic airgun survey, used to discover oil and gas deposits hundreds of kilometres under the sea floor, can blanket an area of more than 300,000 sq. km, raising background noise levels by 100 times continuously for weeks or months.  Seismic airgun surveys are loud enough to penetrate hundreds of kilometres into the ocean floor, even after going through thousands of metres of ocean.  Seismic blasts can have damaging effects for up to 4,000 km.  There is a wealth of peer reviewed evidence to show that these surveys do damage to wildlife.  As highlighted by the Irish documentary, &quot;Ireland&rsquo;s Deep Atlantic&quot;, and the film, &quot;Atlantic&quot;, seismic testing blasts are essentially waves of death that cause disorientation and internal bleeding in cetaceans for distances of up to 100 miles.  This is why Dingle fishermen find deep sea beings such as giant squid in their nets after rounds of seismic testing in the Porcupine Basin.<\/p><p>Oil and gas exploration, apart from its effect on the climate, destroys fundamental aspects of the ocean's fabric.  Despite this, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has repeatedly told this House that it will not ban exploration from areas in which these deep sea coral reefs are found or dolphins or blue whales are feeding.  The Minister confirmed this again this week when he went back on his previous statements and attempted to stop the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill by calling for a money message before the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage.<\/p><p>I ask the Government to draw on indigenous and local knowledge in Ireland.  Irish fishermen are reporting drops in fish populations in the Porcupine Basin.  They are banned from fishing in the area over months of seismic testing and return to find whiting, cod, tuna and general wildlife populations reduced.  The Government is damaging fish populations and wildlife for a privatised, speculative industry that provides no jobs, long-term income for the State or energy security as we do not have oil refineries that would meet demand.  Things must change.  The Government's business as usual strategy spells disaster not just for human existence but for the future of all life on this planet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000022#Y00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1559219400,"counter":313,"content":"<p>When I was growing up in rural Ireland as a young boy, I do not think I ever heard the words biodiversity or climate change.  Times have changed and it saddens me when I hear that animals and plants are disappearing faster than at any other time in human history.  It is happening in Ireland too.  A biodiversity report published earlier this month gave a grim account of the significant dangers facing plants and animals across the globe.  The report shows that species loss on the planet is accelerating at a rate often tens or thousands of times faster than in the past.  A decline in biodiversity on the planet is bad, not only due to the loss of certain animals and plant species but also because of the danger that it poses to human survival.  Plants and animals are the building blocks on which human life depends.  Sadly, Ireland is not immune from the losses to plant and animal life that are occurring across the planet.  Of the 3,000 or so plant and animal species in Ireland that are subject to a conservation assessment, approximately one quarter are facing extinction.<\/p><p>We have 1,200 plants in Ireland, and of those, 100 are threatened with extinction and 20 are critically endangered.  It is not only our plants that are in danger but also several species of the country's wildlife are under strain.  The curlew, which is the largest European wading bird, has declined in Ireland by 96% since the 1970s.  More than a third of Ireland's 99 bee species are threatened with extinction.  Those are scary statistics.<\/p> <p> Ireland has one of the worst records for responding to climate change in the EU and among developed nations.  Ireland is certain to miss its 2020 targets for reducing harmful emissions, as set under the 2016 Paris Agreement.  A tipping point has been reached and we now need to put climate change and biodiversity at the top of the agenda.<\/p> <p> In the programme for Government the Government promised that it would invest in the better energy programme.  It was stated in the programme that it would provide grants to 170,000 households, but we hear that the entire budget for 2019 will have been committed by the end of May for insulation grants, the retrofitting of homes and the warmer homes scheme.  The Government must ensure the lack of funds will not affect the insulation grants and renewable energy grants for people who badly need such work on their homes.  I urge the Government to examine the grants and increase them, given that, for example, the installation of a heat pump in a private house can cost between &euro;5,000 and &euro;10,000, yet the maximum grant is &euro;3,700, which leaves a large amount for homeowners to pay.  The grant available for cavity wall insulation is only &euro;400, as is the grant for attic insulation.  All the grants must be examined and increased.  We must encourage people to insulate their homes and thus reduce their energy needs.  Will the Government investigate the possibility of reducing or entirely removing VAT on material used to insulate houses?  That would be a major incentive to people and would encourage them to insulate their homes to the maximum and thus reduce the use of fossil fuels.<\/p> <p> With regard to electric cars, the Government stated in the programme for Government that it wants Ireland to become a leader in the take-up of electric vehicles, but talk is very cheap.  If the VAT and VRT were reduced or entirely removed on all electric vehicles it could greatly increase their sales.  We must also find ways to reduce the number of cars on the roads.  Many of my constituents in west Cork have said to me that if there was a park-and-ride service available to them that connected with the city, they would definitely avail of the service.  I already raised the matter with the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il and he promised he would get back to me, but I am still waiting for his response.  Now that the elections are over he might have a little more time to study what needs to be done.  I previously called for a park-and-ride system for west Cork.  Buses from Skibbereen, Mizen, Sheep's Head, Bantry and the Beara Peninsula, Drimoleague and Dunmanway would feed into Clonakilty and there would be a park-and-ride system to take people from there into the city.  We have no interconnecting transport service from west Cork to the rail system, and we have no rail system in west Cork, which means people are totally and utterly dependent on the car.  Many families have told me they would not need a second car if some form of proper transport service was available.  The Government is standing idly by and will not even put something in place that might resolve the situation.  We need proper access from west Cork.  We would not need to use cars if there was a service in place.  If such a service was reasonably priced and wheelchair accessible it would have the potential to replace thousands of cars on the roads, especially at peak times.<\/p> <p> There is no doubt that we need to make a positive shift in Ireland's attitudes to biodiversity loss and climate change.  The Government must create incentives to encourage businesses and the general public, such as the incentives I have already mentioned.  The Government could have pulled the plug on the outrageous scandal of the harvesting of kelp off Bantry Bay.  As a case on the matter is before the courts, I will not interfere in it.  I have spoken many times in the House about the damage it will cause to the environment and to the livelihood of inshore fishermen.  Planning application after planning application has been submitted for fish farms in west Cork in recent months, in Union Hall, Castlehaven, Kinsale, Urhan and Bantry.  Companies from France and all over the country are looking to set up fish farms off the west Cork coast.  That will do untold damage to the environment and the underwater species.  In every other country there is a planning system in place and strict planning laws that we do not apply; therefore, it is open season here; one can just apply anywhere one wants, and one will get it.  I have asked the Minister to make sure that proper planning regulations are in place and that we can at least protect people's livelihood and the species we have.  It is time to wake up.  The people of the country spoke last week and they made it very clear that the Government is not doing its job correctly regarding the environment.  As politicians, we must do everything in our power to make sure that it does so in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000022#Y00300","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559220000,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate, although I might not use the full ten minutes allocated to me, and to give my thoughts and ideas.  I thank Deputy Niamh Smyth who made a very important presentation to the D&aacute;il yesterday evening, as did all the speakers - Deputy Catherine Martin, Deputy Michael Collins and everybody else.  The debate must include everybody.  I appeal for it not to become a debate that pits urban against rural or one group against another.  We all clearly recognise that there is a major issue at stake.  Biodiversity loss is a major problem for us all.  We all have a responsibility to work together to make the improvements that are necessary.  When talking about biodiversity and different types of pollution people ask about China, Russia, America and India.  Despite the fact that we are a small nation, we must also ask, what about Ireland?<\/p>  <p>  We should acknowledge one point in this debate.  The past generations in this country were outstanding people who looked after the environment.  I accept the times were different and they did not have the same challenges of industrialisation and the current threats we face.  I was brought up on a small farm in the west.  I can speak for all my neighbours, both urban and rural.  Nobody would touch a bird's nest, no matter where it was built.  A hedgerow would never be cut down.  No ordinary man or woman would ever touch an historic building.  In fact, it would be preserved.  We must include in this debate the men and women of previous generations who went before us.<\/p>  <p>  Those who are involved in Tidy Towns groups are so environmentally friendly and aware.  There is a lot of goodwill and many good people.  We must all work together to ensure that we make progress in this area and perhaps become a world leader.  Ireland has become a world leader and champion of so many causes; let us become the champions of the world in that regard.  We talk proudly about our green image and the beautiful green island we have, which attracts a lot of people here, but if things keep going the way they are, we will not be able to talk in those terms.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin referred to pollution from plastics.  My mother who is 83 years of age is disgusted at the amount of plastic wrapping on everything when she brings her shopping home from town.  That must be tackled.  Incentives must be introduced to deal with the issue.  We all talk about it, but not enough is happening to make sure we get rid of the scourge of plastic wrapping, which in some cases is double plastic wrapping and a box.  Another scourge is tinfoil packaging.  Everywhere I go now everything is in a tinfoil tray.  I see all the tinfoil trays in my home, my mother's home and other homes I go into.<\/p><p>This is another scourge.  All this tinfoil cannot be good but perhaps that is a debate for another day.  <\/p> <p> There will be impacts on health, the environment and the economy if we do not deal with this issue.  However, I am very confident that our young people will insist that we, as legislators, work very closely with them to bring about major change in society.  There is widespread support for their demands.  They are not asking but rather demanding that we deal with this issue.  They can see a major threat to our planet.  However, some people still have to meet their heating needs through turf, and we must take them into account.  We can control that to a degree.  We can stop the turf machines from getting bigger and from doing more damage or limit turf-cutting to smaller machines to ensure that as little damage as possible is done.  I do not believe we can completely remove the need for turf but things are changing rapidly.  While fewer people are now cutting turf, we must recognise that it is needed because it is all some people can afford.<\/p> <p> Fertiliser use is another issue.  In a former life I was a horticulturist, which is what I trained to do in college.  I like to think that I have a good understanding of this area.  We have to deal with the issue of fertiliser use, particularly near our lakes and rivers.  While there are some restrictions in that regard at the moment, we are going to have to tackle it properly.  <\/p> <p> I can remember a time when virtually every farmer produced an acre or half-acre of barley, wheat or oats.  There were fantastic occasions when crops were sown and saved.  We should encourage that again.  In recent years, one has to go through a licensing system and seek permission to grow a bit of grain on the farm.  Why not encourage farmers to do that again, with financial support if necessary, and have them grow an acre or two of grain, barley, wheat or oats.  This is an interesting idea, which stemmed from the smaller farms.  Expansion occurred and every farm got bigger, with more livestock and bigger crops.  We can organise ourselves and much of this can happen on a smaller scale without people incurring a financial loss.  The bigger our farms got and the more they expanded, the more difficult people found it to survive.  <\/p> <p> I acknowledge that things are happening in the area of rural transport.  We have the Local Link bus service, which is a tremendous help for many communities.  However, it must be expanded.  I am confident that if we had a better rural transport system, many of our people would leave their cars at home to go to their local town.  It might be a small measure but it would be good for biodiversity. <\/p> <p> We have to achieve results in the area of retrofitting houses.  I have spoken to Deputy Niamh Smyth about this and it is a must.  We need more investment in retrofitting, which must be done on a large scale.  It is crucial to feed into all of this and to ensure that we as a nation are playing our part.  We must restore the budgets for bodies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  That area of work is becoming so important and will be important in terms of biodiversity and showing that we are really serious about this situation.  <\/p> <p> Some people might disagree with me but it is very important that we make some of these smaller changes, which I believe could have a major bearing on all of this.  We must remember that the bigger companies which are doing damage will have to play their part in remedying the situation.  I am talking about factory farming and that kind of thing.  Bigger companies are causing more pollution and this has to be tackled.  More incentives will have to be provided for electric cars as well.  It is good that we are having a serious debate about this issue.  We have to address these issues together and work with each other to make real progress.  The younger generation will not forgive any of us if we do not do this together.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000023#Z00200","speaker":"1342","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559220600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I will address some of the points raised by the Deputies present, namely, Deputies Smyth, Eugene Murphy and &Oacute; Snodaigh.  I thank the speakers who contributed last night, namely, Deputies Burton and Connolly.  Deputy Catherine Martin also spoke earlier.<\/p><p>I welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's commitment to the biodiversity agenda.  It is something that we need to tackle collaboratively if it is to be done in any kind of effective way.  We have clarity on the rates of extinction now and this should be a clarion call for immediate and effective action.  We have taken action.  This is not just about fine words.  I have a biodiversity action plan.  I have increased resources for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, designated 250 special areas of conservation and secured Government approval for a biodiversity duty.  I have also published climate action plans for the natural and built heritage.  The Government has acted even in the teeth of a downturn.  My Department is also working across Government on the sustainable development goals.  I want to be constructive but I must remind Deputy Smyth that when her party was in government it severely cut the National Parks and Wildlife Service budget.  I am restoring that budget.  We prefer actions rather than words, but I was very pleased to hear the Deputy repeat many of my points about what has to happen in her conclusions.  I thank her for that.  Consensus is ultimately the key challenge in which all parties ultimately have a stake.  We are not hiding behind this issue.  Nature is the web of our lives and we are not prepared to sit back or fail to act on the imperative for immediate and effective responses.  <\/p><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh for his comments. <b><\/b>Is fearr d&eacute;anach na go br&aacute;ch - better sooner than later.  The reality of extinction is that we are the first generation to have the hard facts about it and the last that can take action and is in a position to act.  That bell is tolling loudly and we all need to hear it.  The Deputy is correct in his summation of the causes and I hear what he is saying.  Many of his ideas certainly merit further thought from my Department and the Government and I thank him for acknowledging the valuable contribution of the farming communities and NGOs with which we partner on many different initiatives.  We spent thousands of days and millions of euro on tackling invasive species, such as the rhododendron, as was mentioned.  <\/p><p>I agree with Deputy Eugene Murphy that biodiversity loss is a matter for us all.  It is a shared responsibility.  Action, as the Deputy said, begins at home.  There must be a profound change in how we interact with nature and in our patterns of consumption.  I agree that the response has to be a whole of society response.  I am working hard to restore the National Parks and Wildlife Service budget to pre-crisis levels.  I agree that biodiversity loss is a problem for all of us and that we have to work together.<\/p><p>Deputy Murphy also made a point about bogs.  My Department has worked hard to reach agreement with landowners and turf cutters and we are restoring 12 raised bogs.  He also mentioned the idea of growing small areas of grain.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's GLAS scheme includes an option for small-scale tillage which benefits many birds, including the Yellowhammer.<\/p><p> We have made meaningful progress on many fronts and there is much to commend.  We still have a natural environment which offers us significant resources and advantages.  I recognise that there is a need to do more, however.  It was helpful to hear the different contributions from the various parties as to what the Government, despite the progress made to date, should be doing.  I recognise that and I am committed to moving forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000024#AA00200","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment Report: Statements","time":1559221200,"counter":319,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000025#BB00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1559221200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Nature and the services that natural systems provide are essential for human life and for people's quality of life.  The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, provides governments and countries across the globe, including Ireland, with scientific assessments on the state of the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity and ecosystems, as well as the contributions they make to people and society.  We are all familiar with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which provides strong science-based assessments of climate change.  The IPBES does similar scientific assessments on biodiversity and the services it provides.  It also provides information on tools and methods to protect and sustainably use biodiversity and natural resources - our natural capital.<\/p><p>Like 130 other countries, Ireland is a member of the IPBES.  At the latter's recent meeting in Paris, members received disturbing news.  There is stark scientific evidence on the health of the natural environment which highlighted an alarming decline in nature and a critical risk for humanity in the 21st century.  The evidence was presented in the IPBES global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services.  This report is the most comprehensive assessment of its kind yet produced.  The message from this assessment is clear.  Nature, biodiversity, the life that we share on this planet and the contributions they make to human existence are in trouble.  The scientific evidence is clear and unequivocal that the primary causes of this are human-driven.  Current patterns of production and consumption globally are unsustainable.  Climate change resilience depends greatly on biodiversity and looking after our natural capital.  Most of nature&rsquo;s contributions to people are not fully replaceable while some are irreplaceable.  Existing policies are not halting the global declines across biodiversity.<\/p><p>The report indicates that, globally, we are losing biodiversity at a rate unprecedented in human history.  The number of plants, insects, mammals and birds threatened or endangered is growing year on year.  The report assesses changes over the past 50 years and presents a clear picture of the relationship between economic development and how it affects biodiversity.  The land, ocean, atmosphere and biosphere are being altered to an unparalleled degree.  Land and sea-use changes, direct exploitation of animals and plants, climate change, pollution and invasive species are the main drivers of biodiversity loss globally on the land.<\/p><p>In the context of marine ecosystems, direct exploitation, mainly fishing, has had the largest relative impact, followed by land and sea-use change.  The report makes it clear that the current response from the international community to biodiversity loss is insufficient and that transformative changes are needed to restore and protect nature, along with the benefits and essential services derived from it.  It advises us that only if transformative change is taken globally to reduce the intensity of drivers of biodiversity loss will these trends be halted.  If this does not occur, there will be a further acceleration in the global rate of species extinction which is already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million years.<\/p><p>The report highlights that a biodiversity crisis has knock-on effects on all of society&rsquo;s life-support system and our well-being.  For example, it states that the current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services will undermine progress towards 80% of the assessed targets of the sustainable development goals.  Those goals relate to poverty, hunger, health, water, cities, climate, oceans and land.  Loss of biodiversity is, therefore, shown to be not only an environmental issue but also developmental, economic, security, social and moral issue.  The report highlights indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, which include increased population and <i>per capita<\/i>consumption, technological innovation, which may reduce or increase damage to nature, as well as governance and accountability issues.  Ireland is part of the global system.  We consume food and raw materials from many other parts of the world, from countries far from us which are suffering huge losses of biodiversity.<\/p><p>These global messages on the state of biodiversity are mirrored in my Department&rsquo;s reports on the status of Ireland&rsquo;s biodiversity.  Similar to the declines being experienced at a global level, biodiversity in Ireland is also demonstrating worrying and ongoing declines.  Draft results from the 2019 habitats directive report tell us the conservation status of over 50% of protected habitats show a declining trend.  Of particular note are declines in peatlands, grasslands and some of the marine habitats.  Several months ago, the National Biodiversity Data Centre published results from its butterfly and bumble bee recording schemes.  These surveys have revealed rates of decline in these important insects which must concern us.  Recorders detected average declines of common bumble bees of 3.7% per annum over the past six years across 100 sites.  This is markedly above the 1.0% global average.<\/p><p>The situation is urgent but solutions are possible.  Biodiversity decline and loss of habitats does not happen in isolation.  Other societal and economic issues are also relevant.  Sustainable measures to protect biodiversity can also have a positive impact on other societal challenges.  For example, sustainable agricultural practices to protect biodiversity can at the same time meet food production needs.  Agriculture, fisheries and forestry are key parts of the economy.  However, we need to look hard at how to increase their environmental sustainability.  Relatively simple changes to policy and incentives for these sectors can yield significant benefits for nature and provide necessary trade-offs if we are to safeguard the well-being of future generations.<\/p><p>If Ireland is going to contribute to the reversal of these trends, we must look again at some of our policies to promote more sustainable production of food, timber and the use of natural resources of fish, water and air.  Unless transformative change occurs at global and national levels, as well as regional and local, to address the damage to biodiversity while actions to conserve biodiversity are intensified, these figures will continue to worsen.  Further extinctions and declines will occur with subsequent effects on our well-being and economy.<\/p><p>This is all the more pressing in the face of climate change.  A healthy and resilient environment is necessary to help us mitigate and adapt to its effects.  There are, however, many positives.  The national efforts, led by the Government, in response to the biodiversity crisis to conserve biodiversity are bearing fruit.  One such initiative is the national pollinator plan relating to our 100 species of wild and managed bees.  This was developed by a wide range of organisations led by the National Biodiversity Data Centre and Trinity College Dublin.  It has engaged people all around the country and stimulated a large number of locally based conservation projects.<\/p><p>As I stated yesterday, the national biodiversity action plan is the key national overarching policy for our work.  Ireland&rsquo;s third national biodiversity action plan runs from 2017 to 2021.  It sets out actions that a range of government, civil and private sectors will undertake to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s vision for biodiversity which I listed yesterday evening.  My Department has just launched a round of consultations with all relevant Departments, agencies and State-owned companies, as well as farmers, landowners, NGOs and other sectors, to set out our priorities for action in the plan, focusing more specifically on the habitats and species protected under EU directives, in the special areas of conservation, SACs, and the special protection areas, SPAs, designated under those directives.<\/p><p>Other concrete actions we have taken in recent years include placing approximately 17% of the terrestrial area within the protected area network.  We have accelerated the designation process, investing &euro;650 million since 2011 on a major restoration effort on our raised bogs.<\/p><p>There is also the National Parks and Wildlife Service&rsquo;s farm plan scheme.  We established the national curlew task force and the curlew conservation programme.  We are also recruiting specialist ecology staff and rangers for our parks and reserves.  We have the EU LIFE programme, the KerryLIFE project, the AranLIFE project and the Raptor Life project.  I outlined all of these initiatives yesterday.  There is  also our very first biodiversity sectoral climate change adaptation plan.  At the conference we held earlier this year, we encouraged sectors to contribute towards the Seeds for Nature campaign in an effort to step up and accelerate progress towards achieving the objectives of the national biodiversity action plan.<\/p> <p> The Government is taking a co-ordinated approach and working across Departments in order to protect our biodiversity.   My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, has also achieved much through work in his Department.  Even with all this good work, however, we have to raise our game and we intend to do so.  I appreciate the contributions that will be made to the debate from all the Deputies present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000025#BB00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Message from Business Committee","time":1559221800,"counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000026#CC00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1559221800,"counter":323,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I wish to announce a message from the Business Committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

Regarding some of the Minister's comments when she referred to Fianna F&aacute;il's time in government, I remind her that was almost ten years ago.  I appreciate that she is new to her role.  I have full confidence in her and I appreciate the efforts she is making and the measures she is bringing forward to tackle biodiversity.  However, her Government's record during its tenure in office has been pretty abysmal.<\/p>  <p>  As I noted yesterday, it was Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s amendment that provided for the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s declaration of a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency.  Fianna F&aacute;il also called for the biodiversity crisis to be examined by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly.  There is full agreement in this House that the situation relating to biodiversity in Ireland is at crisis levels.  The dire state of affairs here very much mirrors the disturbing global picture.  The assessment report of the UN intergovernmental platform is the largest and most comprehensive assessment on the health of nature ever published.  It underlines that we are faced with a global emergency.  Ecosystems are rapidly declining and a million species are at risk of extinction.  The global assessment report is extremely disturbing because it clearly shows that we will leave behind a much worse world for future generations.<\/p>  <p>  The report notes that the main drivers of global biodiversity loss include the massive increases in production and excessive working of land and soils, as well as the climate crisis and rising levels of pollution.  It highlights the extremely damaging impacts of wastewater, plastics and fertilisers.  I emphasised yesterday that destruction of biodiversity does not only mean loss of species.  The Irish public will suffer significant environmental, economic and health impacts without radical Government action.  My colleague, Deputy Eugene Murphy, alluded to that during the debate which preceded this one.  If trends continue, there is much greater risk of disruption to our agriculture and forestry sectors.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the very informative list of necessary measures detailed in that report.  It is important the Government clearly addresses how it is integrating these into departmental strategies.  The report calls for: massive investments in afforestation and other green infrastructure; reducing levels of consumption and waste; shifting incentives and subsidies to encourage protective measures; revising trade rules and accounting for nature deterioration in international trade; stronger environmental laws and ensuring enforcement; and public awareness raising campaigns on biodiversity protection.  These are the key recommendations in the report that we need to see integrated into departmental strategies.<\/p>  <p>  Naturally, responses are very much linked to action in respect of the current climate emergency.  However, Ireland&rsquo;s approach to climate policy at international level has been to trumpet itself as a supposed exception, calling for weaker metrics and regulations and demanding less onerous obligations instead of planning on how to meet the demands.  The Government's initial climate plan was poor.  The reaction of so many citizens in demanding real action now has been so strong that it will bring forward a new one in June.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland needs to regain credibility within the EU and UN in the context of the climate and biodiversity crises.  Yet just before the schools&rsquo; strike for climate action in March, all of Fine Gael&rsquo;s MEPs voted against an amendment to increase the EU&rsquo;s 2030 target.  The Government has also refused to join other progressive EU member states and support greater climate ambition in the EU Council.  This Government&rsquo;s approach goes directly to the public's demands.  On Friday last, on foot of the RedC exit poll, we learned that almost 90% of voters feel that the Government needs to prioritise climate change more that it is doing at present.<\/p>  <p>  At international level, Ireland must lead the way in drawing up new global goals for biodiversity so agreement can be reached at the next meeting on the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in China in 2020.  It should also lead the way at EU level and ensure the sustainable development goals and targets are prioritised in EU legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister stated yesterday that the Government&rsquo;s efforts are bearing fruit and that progress is being made to protect biodiversity and habitats.  Perhaps this is the message the Minister hears at the Cabinet table but it is not the message the rest of us are hearing from citizens on the ground.  The necessary examination of this emergency by the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly is a reflection of the failure of the Government to adequately prioritise biodiversity protections.  A co-ordinated strategy which integrates biodiversity objectives into policy-making is needed across all Departments and public bodies, particularly Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte.  The Government must ensure the enforcement of existing environmental laws and restore budgetary allocations to relevant State agencies to pre-recession levels.  We also need greater investment in ecology staff, particularly in local authorities, in order to review ecological impacts of developments and improve enforcement of environmental protections.<\/p>  <p>  I do not need to tell the Minister that the country is covered with litter as a result of illegal dumping.  Every local authority, including that in my area in Cavan, is completely under-resourced in the context of dealing with this problem.  We have one person or two at the most on the group in my local authority area who are able to go out and investigate illegal dumping and they then have to clean up the mess and try to find evidence regarding from where the rubbish involved came.  Having one or two people doing this work is not enough.  Greater resources need to be provided to our local authorities in order to ensure that they have the manpower to deal with this problem.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday the Minister stated, \"The Government is creating a legal onus, or a biodiversity duty, on public bodies to have regard to policies, guidelines and objectives to promote the conservation of biodiversity and the national biodiversity action plan.\"  I would welcome further information on this legislation, when it will be introduced and on how it aligns with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under EU and international law.<\/p>  <p>  As I mentioned previously, the climate crisis is fundamentally linked to biodiversity loss.  The cross-party report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action includes several recommendations which would help to reduce emissions and encourage a sustainable approach to agriculture, forestry and peatlands.  The Government has committed to: the preparation of a national land-use plan; that new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments post-2020 will be made available for activities which supports ecosystems and carbon storage, with a focus on planting of native trees; a new integrated plan with targets for the restoration, rehabilitation and re-wetting of peatlands, as well as a new national hedgerow conservation strategy; and a review of current national forestry strategy in order to ensure policy properly supports native trees and biodiversity-rich woodlands.  The Government must deliver on each of these recommendations, including associated timelines, in the all-of-Government climate plan due in June.  The science demands measurable progress and not living documents.  Perhaps it is not the most exciting of messages for the Government to have to sell but it is vital that we can track implementation across Departments and relevant public bodies.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to read into the record the conclusion of the Living Planet Report 2018, which states, \"We are the first generation that has a clear picture of the value of nature and the enormous impact we have on it.  We may be the last that can act to reverse this trend&rdquo;.<\/p><p>To say that biodiversity has not been a priority for Fine Gael in government would be a gross understatement.  The Government must end the empty rhetoric on sustainability.  No one, particularly the younger citizens, buys it.  The Government has an opportunity to take the initiative and step in the right direction by immediately responding to the global assessment report, and reflect in full the Oireachtas committee's recommendations on biodiversity in its new climate plan.  These must also feed into current departmental planning and strategies, including in agriculture, forestry and peatlands, and must also inform investment decisions in budget 2020.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000026#CC00600","speaker":"1271","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559222400,"counter":328,"content":"<p>It is interesting that the two debates, this and the one we had earlier, are interlinked.  They flow into each other.  Last night I talked about the five drivers of the negative effects we have seen on systems of biodiversity in this country and elsewhere.  The same five drivers are having a negative effects throughout the world.  I refer to the way we have exploited our land and sea.  I refer also to fish farming, urbanisation, intensification or centralisation of farms and ranching, which has destroyed many hedgerows to create larger fields and generate a greater crop yield, and to the use of pesticides and the likes to increase the yield.  We have harvested our forests but last night the Minister asked what would we do without forests.<\/p>  <p>  I mention the exploitation of nature for fun.  I have no problem with its exploitation for sustenance in that we need to survive and feed ourselves but there is a level at which we can survive without having to exploit and do damage to our environment.<\/p>  <p>  People throughout the world and on this island do not believe that the climate is changing.

There have been many changes in climate over decades, centuries and millennia, but what is different about this change is that it is happening in front of us and it is being caused by us.  It is not caused by plate shifting, volcanoes and ash obscuring the sun.  This has been caused directly by our exploitation of natural resources for profit, greed and our gratification as humans.  Everyone is not benefitting from this exploitation.  The opposite is the case.<\/p>  <p>  In the intensification and acceleration of that exploitation, the other driver is pollution, in particular, plastics and chemicals.  Our air, water and land are being poisoned by us.  In many cases, the damage will be irreversible.  We have seen the damage of nuclear pollution where a little damage will take many centuries to undo but in comparison to the pollution in which we all have been involved in terms of our use of plastics and more frequent air travel, nuclear pollution is minuscule.  While we will not be around to see the damage done, we are seeing the damage our pollution of the water and soil is having.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned invasive species last night as something we can immediately address.  If nothing else, the international body can have a quick effect and, in terms of the changes required, at a small cost, but that is not the problem.  I outlined last night that one fifth of the earth's surface is at risk of invasive plants and animals, and I presume the sea and inland waters are as bad, if not worse.  I am aware of many invasive species.  As I said last night, the document from Invasive Species Ireland mentioned plants which I was not aware were invasive species.  However, when one looks at the photographs in the field guide produced by that organisation, which, I think, no longer exists, it is scary because they are species we now take for granted.  They carpet many of our waterways or lakes, and some of the national parks.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Madigan, mentioned rhododendron and laurel.  Rhododendron is being widely sold in supermarkets.  It is a nice plant to look at but it is being sold in supermarkets at the same time we are trying to rid the national parks of it.  The fact it has dislodged or overwhelmed native species to such a degree that they are endangered shows that much more should be done.  It might need to become, along with other plants, a banned or reportable species.  There is legislation to deal with noxious species, most of which are native or, at least, have been here for many centuries.  The Minister could provide local communities with incentives to remove invasive species.  That might involve funding to Tidy Towns organisations or groups, such as Men's Sheds, which are active throughout the country.  Towns could get some sort of credit.  Organisations, such as Irish Seed Savers and groups looking to replant the lumper potato, could be helped.<\/p>  <p>  We need to increase tax on packaging and increase the electrification of trains and cars.  We need to increase the use allotments and community gardens in urban centres.  It is happening but not at the rate required and that would encourage people.  That is not only about planting.  It is giving people a greater appreciation of how we are interdependent on all the other species with which we share the earth.  Our survival depends on us protecting the world's ecosystem.  Thankfully, the younger generation seems to understand that.  Hopefully, it will continue to put the pressure on us, as legislators, but also on the rest of society, to decrease and reverse the damage we are doing.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to an interesting scheme, and I do not know why it is not being replicated in Ireland.  An Irish company, Kingspan, announced that it will recycle 500 million plastic bottles from the Mediterranean, bring them ashore in Barcelona and transform them into insulation.  Why is that not happening in Ireland?  That company is based in Ireland.  Our shores are just as polluted as those in the Mediterranean.  We could ask companies like Kingspan how to remove plastic from the seas around Ireland and reuse it so that it does not merely go into a black hole in the hope that it will go away, which is what we did in the past with our rubbish and which we are living to regret.<\/p>  <p>  Much more can be done to ensure polluters are punished, exposed and fined to such a degree that others will learn that behaviour is not in anybody's interest.<\/p><p> It is great that 130 countries are coming together under the umbrella of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.  I do not know enough about this initiative or the extent of its funding or power but the EU recently decided to divert &euro;13 billion from the social fund into military research.  I did not see any similar diversion of funds towards radical action to save our planet or encourage some of the projects I have mentioned.  These projects could be started quickly and could have a rapid impact on what is required.  In the longer term, however, much bigger schemes are needed.  We need our culture to move from capitalism, which is the exploitation of resources for profit, towards a global system that appreciates and saves the earth, not just for the few but for all those who live on this planet, not only humans but all other natural species as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000027#DD00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559223000,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I wonder if it is a sign of positive things to come that the D&aacute;il is having two debates on biodiversity in one week, one on the extinction of species and the other on the related topic of ecosystems.  We have to take climate change seriously as otherwise the consequences will be dire.  While reflecting on what I would say today, I was reminded of a conference I attended in April 2013, which was organised by the Mary Robinson Foundation, Irish Aid, the World Food Programme and other organisations.  People came from all over the world, including Nepal, the Caribbean, Mongolia, the Arctic, South America, Africa and Bangladesh, to relate their experience of the impact of climate change on their communities and way of life.  We heard the experiences of farmers, fishers and herders and everyone told the same story of great resilience in the face of the challenges arising from climate change.  The conference was entitled, Hunger, Nutrition, Climate Justice, and the point was that all three are related.  Hunger and nutrition are tied in with climate.  The issue is not only climate change but also climate justice.  The previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, committed to the idea of climate justice.<\/p><p>We are making some progress, with Deputy Thomas Pringle's Bill on fossil fuels divestment and we have seen the green wave in European and local elections, on which I congratulate the Green Party.  I also acknowledge the work of the various non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  I make particular mention of a book titled, <i>Climate Generation: Awakening to Our Children&rsquo;s Future<\/i>, written by Lorna Gold of Tr&oacute;caire.  It should be required reading for everyone, that is, if we want a future for today's children, never mind their children.  The book gets across in a very practical, readable and accessible manner the ways in which climate change is the greatest challenge for our generation.  The easy part is voting green.  The difficult part is putting into practice the principles and theories that will make a difference and bring about climate justice.  Ms Gold traces her journey in coming to an understanding of what climate change really means and the danger that she, as a mother trying to protect her children and the world in which we live, faces.  The book is positive in that it shows that we can make a difference.  I encourage people to read it.<\/p><p>Biodiversity concerns the variety and variability of life on earth and includes marine biodiversity.  However, biodiversity is not distributed equitably or evenly on earth.  In the previous debate on the extinction of species, it was scary to realise the extent of the extinction and the rapid environmental changes that cause these mass extinctions.  The report we are discussing is very clear and I will refer to parts of it which stuck with me.  Nature, it states, is essential for human existence and good quality of life but most of nature's contributions to people are not fully replaceable and some are irreplaceable.  Another key message that struck me was that nature across most of the globe has now been significantly altered by multiple human drivers and that it is human actions that threaten more species with global extinction now than ever before.<\/p><p>When we consider the human aspect, disasters occurred recently in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.  We, in the developed world, are the humans in question.  We are the drivers who are threatening the globe, not the humans in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe who are mainly peasant farmers and fishers and women of very limited means.  What we are seeing are changes in land and sea use, the exploitation of organisms, pollution, consumption patterns and human population trends.  We have statistics showing that humans are estimated to have caused an observed warming of approximately 1&deg;C relative to pre-industrial levels and that average temperatures have been rising for the past 30 years.  Indigenous peoples and local communities in many parts of the world are suffering.  Ironically, as the report tells us, some climate change mitigation programmes have had negative impacts on these indigenous peoples and local communities who are facing ongoing deforestation, the loss of wetlands, mining, an increase in unsustainable agriculture, pollution and water insecurity.  Some of these developments are being driven by multinational companies which do not even pay tax in the countries in which they are operating.<\/p><p>What we, in the developed world, are doing, allowing to be done and turning a blind eye to is impacting on countries in the developing world, the global south.  These are the countries that we support through Irish Aid.  &quot;Policy coherence&quot; is the phrase that should be at the heart of what we are discussing.  Ireland played a dominant role in securing agreement on the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  One can see how dependent these goals are on climate justice, with one specifically related to climate action.  Ireland is not leading by example.  Our recently launched policy for international development, A Better World: Ireland&rsquo;s policy for international development, is very firm that the SDGs are at the heart of our approach to international development and climate action is a focus in the document.  We are making a difference in health, education and reducing hunger and poverty.  The Overseas Development Institute stated in 2018 that Ireland is the most efficient donor in targeting extreme poverty.<\/p><p>A Better World commits Ireland to new initiatives, scaling up our funding on climate action and exploring innovative approaches to climate finance, risk insurance and support for small islands developing states, especially those that are most vulnerable.  We know that some of these islands are faced with being wiped out in a number of years.  The policy document also features a commitment to a new oceans funding initiative to explore the potential of the blue economy.  We have to match these initiatives with initiatives in Ireland.  It sometimes strikes me that we the Oireachtas is not doing enough, even on simple matters such as waste disposal.  For example, we have several bins for separated waste but I guarantee that if we looked in them now, we would find the same items in all three bins.  We are not leading by example and we could be doing far more.<\/p><p>The burden of climate change has not been distributed proportionately.  I was struck by a statistic at the recent D&oacute;chas conference showing that it would take a Ugandan farmer 198 years to produce the annual emissions of one New Yorker.  That speaks clearly to the lack of proportionality involved in this.<\/p><p>It is clear from this global assessment report and its research findings that they must be the driver, when it comes to climate, the environment and agriculture in Ireland.  We are already facing fines because we are not reaching targets, which is a total waste of money that could be used in better ways to meet the targets.<\/p><p>The greater cost, however, is the damage we are allowing to continue by not matching our words with actions.  This means we must make hard and difficult choices and decisions.  People will be upset, particularly vested interests.  People will be working in the areas affected, which is why forward planning will be needed.  When we look at the procedures, policies and plans we have for health and safety in many areas, for example, fire safety and bettering our own health, we have to bring the same urgency to this issue.  This is about survival.  An Taisce states that the needs of the many must outweigh the economic interests of the few.<\/p><p>The challenge is to achieve the sustainable development goals.  We only have ten or 11 years to do this.  The current trends in biodiversity and ecosystems will directly impact on some 80% of the targets relating to poverty, hunger, health and water.  The answer is not to increase overseas development aid, ODA, because we are not taking climate change seriously.  We must look at ODA and climate change together.  The answer is to do what is right and necessary now.  It is to adopt the attitude of many indigenous peoples, including Native Americans, and think seven generations ahead when we are making decisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000028#EE00400","speaker":"1291"},{"type":"speech","time":1559223600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>I welcome the fact that we are having these statements.  In respect of the proposals and ongoing programme that the Minister mentioned in her speech, we strongly support them.  We would like to see more.  It is good that we are finally having a conversation about biodiversity.  The statement from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history says it all.  For Ireland, there are three dimensions to it, namely, this island; what happens generally in Europe and in the European Union and what we are doing collectively as members; and how we are meeting our requirements under the various international agreements we have signed up to.<\/p>  <p>  I spent three years of my life working in Africa in the 1980s, long before I became a full-time politician.  I have gone back there frequently, particularly in the years when I was Minister of State with responsibility for development.  I also went back there in a private capacity the Christmas before last.  I went back to where I had worked, in Dar es Salaam, which is a very large city on the east coast of Africa.  It was roughly the same size as Dublin when I was working there in the 1980s.  There were about half a million people plus growing towns in the area.  The population is now 8 million.  It is full of traffic.  Without a doubt, there is a growing middle class which has done better.  However, the reality in the Africa that I know is that women are the principal farmers.  Women farmers feed their families.  It has been a cornerstone of the Irish development programme since it was first developed way back in the 1970s that we would be involved on the ground in contributing to key countries.  Malawi has already been mentioned.  Countries like Tanzania and Ethiopia, which the Taoiseach visited not too long ago, are also key countries in the Irish programme.  The difficulty is that in Africa there is a mass migration of people to cities.  We are seeing the development of massively large cities in Africa because, particularly for poor people in the countryside, they offer an opportunity for access to education, to modern infrastructure, sometimes at an appallingly low level, such as lighting and electricity, and to water, even though the standard of that water may be variable.  In the context of Ireland's commitment to development co-operation with countries in Africa and Asia, we need to be very aware of how hard life is for many poor people.  Many Irish people will be familiar with images of the big shanty towns that have developed in different cities.<\/p>  <p>  In my visit back to Tanzania, I got an opportunity to return to the Serengeti and to what is probably the most famous area for seeing animals, the Ngorongoro Crater.  I was stunned at the fall in elephant numbers since the middle of the 1980s when I had been there previously.  By the standard of David Attenborough's television programmes they are still stunning but they are nothing like the numbers that were once there.  Despite massive efforts on the part of the local ranger staff to cut down on poaching, there is international trading in ivory.  There is an awful lot of death and reduction in animal life.  That is not something we can influence but, through our development programmes, we can provide education and support to the institutions in those countries that are training young people to conserve and provide for the animals.  We can lend our voice in international fora to helping women farmers and small farmers and to providing financial structures.  Globalised finance is not friendly to poor people.  It is not friendly to poor people or those in trouble with their mortgages in Ireland but, equally, it is not particularly friendly to poor people in Africa.  There is no great financial discussion here about these issues but finance and how we use the financial resources of the world are absolutely essential in empowering ourselves and all the countries in co-operation through the UN and the various international climate fora.<\/p>  <p>  On our own country and biodiversity, there should be a biodiversity plan for each city in Ireland.  I spoke last night of the wanton felling of trees by developers once they get on a site.  Some colleagues last night who are not here today were very angry that I mentioned the forest fires around places like Killarney a month or two ago and the destruction they caused.  We also had the fires in Donegal around the same time.  While it may be difficult for some of the Deputies, like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who was shouting and roaring last night, to understand it, people who live in cities can be very concerned about the countryside and want to see farmers supported financially to be caretakers of our biodiversity as well as looking after their farming interests.  This is a key balance that we have to address in policy terms.  That may be difficult for a party like Fine Gael.  Traditionally, large farmers have focused on the message that has been about for decades of more and more production rather than the quality of the production and the production being consistent with the protection of biodiversity.  That is something that we have to be able to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to today's water quality report on the beaches around Dublin.  The greater Dublin area is very populated and we have bad reports on quite a number of beaches on the north side, near the centre of town and further to the south.  We have been getting these reports for a number of years now.  It may not be the direct responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Madigan.  It may be more for her colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  We still have something like 42 locations in Ireland that are pumping pollution into lakes, waterways and the sea.  We have discussed the issue in this and previous D&aacute;ileanna.  I would like to hear from the Minister what, if any, progress has been made in respect of beaches like Portrane, a beautiful beach on the north side of the city which has got some black marks in today's report.<\/p><p>This is a really important recreation space for people on the north side of Dublin city.  What is being done about this issue?  Fantastic work was done in Cavan.  Some 20 years ago, the lakes in the county were heavily polluted but control of agricultural effluent has reversed the position.  We can protect our biodiversity.  We have to protect and conserve those environmental assets that are so often also sources of pleasure.  Will the Minister ensure the different streams of Government commentary and planning are drawn together?  Some areas are dealt with by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment while others fall within the remit of the Minister's Department.  The first step I would like to see taken is the development of a whole-of-Government approach to this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000029#FF00100","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559224200,"counter":333,"content":"<p>There was a sad story in the news this morning concerning the death of the last male Sumatran rhino in Malaysia.  It is symbolic but it is impossible for us not to feel a sense of grief, particularly those of us who are of a certain age.  My interest in ecology dates back to the late 1970s, when we studied it in school.  I remember various things from that time, including collectible cards in cereal packets.  At one point, they changed from featuring footballers to bearing pictures of animals at risk of extinction.  It came as a shock last year when the World Wildlife Fund, which was behind those cards in the 1970s, acknowledged that we had lost 50% of all invertebrate wildlife in the world.  We have not managed to change our ways, despite everything we knew at the time and everything we we learned from Rachel Carson about the use of pesticides and insecticides, from Donella Meadows in her book, <i>The Limits of Growth, <\/i>about the challenge we faced in this century to avoid mass extinction and from James Lovelock and his Gaia theory of how our whole living system is connected.<\/p><p>I have some personal reflections from the late 1970s.  We used to go on holidays to Brittas Bay in County Wicklow when I was a child.  I was there again this summer and it evoked some memories.  Everyone of the same age will remember something similar to what I am going to recount.  Our dad used to get us up in the morning and bring us out to collect mushrooms.  I do not know if the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, did that as a child.  We were always guaranteed to get mushrooms back in the late 1970s when we got up every morning at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. to bring back breakfast.  At the height of the drought last summer, I saw the same field where we used to collect mushrooms all those years ago.  It looked like a lot in a holding in the Texas panhandle during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.  There were a few distressed and bedraggled cattle in a field that was so dry it looked almost like rock.  We all know that mushrooms are no longer collected in the same way.  Our use of fertiliser and the ruining of the land means we have lost all of the microbial activity in our soil.  All the nitrogen has killed the dense organic network.  Our farmers are just starting to cotton on that microbial life in the soil is the key to good farming.  All the fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides are killing the natural system and not serving our interests or needs.<\/p><p>I remember as well that we would go fishing when we were on holidays in Brittas Bay back in the 1970s, near where McDaniel's pub is located, if people happen to know that end of the beach.  Dozens of sea trout would flash by in the water back then, flying at speed through one's legs as we fished in a small little brook leading to the Irish Sea.  I remember hiring a boat in Wicklow and having great hassle because every time we dropped a fishing line in the water huge dogfish, a member of the shark family, wrapped themselves around our lines and it was impossible to take them off.  We were looking for cod, mackerel and other fish.  A fisherman from that neck of the woods, who is very interested in this topic, rang me last year.  He was almost crying when he told me that what used to be a prize sport fishing area now only yields tiny fish, if anything.<\/p><p>One of my other memories echoes what Padraic Fogarty has written about in his brilliant book about the loss of nature in Ireland, <i>Whittled Away.  <\/i>Coming home from Brittas Bay in those days seemed like a massive voyage.  We nearly had to take sleeping tablets to survive the journey.  On our way home, even in our drowsy state, it was possible to see the constant dance of insect life as moths were drawn to the car headlights.  The windscreen of the car above the dashboard would be covered in such insects.  I drove for about 12 hours in the country recently, including some time at night, and there was not a single insect on my windscreen when I got home.<\/p><p>As children in the Dublin suburbs, we would leave a jam jar out - Deputy Eugene Murphy might remember this as well - and it would be full of wasps within seconds.  That was cruel and we do things differently now but the richness of insect life and the bird life that came with it is gone.  This is not just about different fields.  It is about our home, island, fields, rivers and sea, which have been completely denuded.  We could count the loss in many different ways.  Farming is one area where we can count it.  The chair of the Committee on Climate Change in the United Kingdom, Lord Deben or John Gummer, warned against us going down the route the UK followed.  He pointed out that we still have some family farming traditions left in Ireland.  We can recover and prevent the complete loss of our soil.  We need a national land use plan to achieve that.  The critical work we did in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Change was the agreement to draw up such a plan.  We will have to agree to farm in a completely different manner because the current method is not working.  We are trading on the Origin Green brand and selling into international commodity markets where we do not get a premium price.  This approach does not work for Irish farmers.  We have to avoid making the mistake of trashing our country in a manner similar to that which occurred in New Zealand for the sake of selling more beef and dairy products into international commodity markets.  Let us reverse direction and abandon the false Origin Green brand.<\/p><p>Let us turn our forestry model around.  We are implementing an industrial model with rows of single species at high risk from invasive beetles and other threats, which are chopped down every 35 years.  That causes further damage to our soil and water courses.  The Minister is at the Cabinet table and a new whole-of-Government climate plan is due to be written.  Let us completely change that forestry model to create a continuous cover forest that will be a joy to behold and walk through, one which will be full of biodiversity.  Timber will be growing in those forests for 100 years and during that time we can employ thousands of young Irish people as expert foresters to bring out the particular trees at the right time.  Such a strategy would also help us to manage flood protection, restore pristine water quality and replenish fish, insect and other wildlife species.  We need to bring those back if we are really serious about protecting nature.  We have to stop extracting peat immediately.  It has stored carbon for 10,000 years.  We have to bring back the equivalent of our Amazonian rainforests - our bogs - so that insect life, bird life and flora can thrive.  <\/p><p>The land use plan is crucial if we are serious about doing these matters.  It should also extend to cover our seas.  Let us listen to the great ecologist, E. O. Wilson.  We should act on his advice to set aside 50% of our natural areas for nature protection.  Let us create marine protection areas for 50% of the North Atlantic.  We can then sleep at night knowing we are turning back the tide in favour of nature.  As we move from the Holocene to the Anthropocene era, the biggest change is that 10,000 years of stable environment is now becoming unstable due to activities that mankind is at the centre of.  The strange thing is that new Anthropocene era will bring us to an understanding that we are not at the centre of everything.  We are connected in community with each other and with nature.  We are part of nature and not separate from it.  Our future health and well-being are dependent on us making this leap.  It is a well-being which relies on a spiritual sense of connection to nature.  <\/p><p>It is as Hopkins said, \"Glory be to God for dappled things [...] All things counter, original, spare, strange\".  I am sorry if that sounds a bit hippyish or out there, but it is about that sense of understanding that we are about to make an evolutionary leap.  We are at an evolutionary changing point when science accepts that it does not know everything and that the division of all things down to the level of individual particulate matter is not wise or the whole truth.  It has to make way for culture, spirit, art and the sense of wonder in the world around us and value that in our economy above all else.  Starting to steer everything we do is going to give us a sense of connection, purpose, meaning and place that will help us to address the major fundamental challenges of our time.  We are ready to do that in Ireland and it is a better place to do it than anywhere else.  Ireland is just as beautiful and important.  Every field, parish and county is important and every young person growing up must not grow up solely with a sense of grief, loss and the absence of hope but rather with a sense of purpose, fulfilment and connection to their place and the part it has to play in our role in protecting the whole planet for their future and the future of nature too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000030#GG00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559224800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>Some of the Deputies who contributed have left.  As such, I will not address their comments but will respond to some of the points raised by Deputies Burton and Eamon Ryan.  I thank Deputy Burton for acknowledging that we are doing something of value and for elevating the debate from the local and projecting it to the global.  I accept what she said about the elephants in Tanzania and the Serengeti, although I have not been there myself.  I am loath to criticise, but recent decisions in countries such as Botswana to lift the ban on hunting are regrettable.  There is undoubtedly an interconnected global web of life and the destruction of any part of it has wide-ranging consequences.<\/p>  <p>  I need to correct the record from last evening.  I decry absolutely the fires in Killarney, but it was 175 acres not thousands of acres that were burned.  I thank the National Parks and Wildlife Service teams, including Seamus Hassett, Peter O'Toole and their colleagues, for their Herculean efforts to put those fires out.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton mentioned Portrane but that matter is one for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and Fingal County Council.  The primary challenge at Portrane was to save the beach.  The \"SeaBees\" are being put in place with the approval of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Burton also referred to biodiversity plans.  We have biodiversity plans for Dublin city and Fingal while D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is reviewing its plan.  Funding for biodiversity can be used by local authorities to draw up further plans.  The Deputy might have noticed after the inaugural biodiversity conference that one of the 40 seeds was a commitment to double funding for local authorities by 2021.  That funding stands at &euro;500,000 and we hope to increase it to &euro;1 million.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan is right that it is about soils and subsoils, what grows and the structural integrity of soil.  As an aside, I note that the Deputy's story of his boyhood was evocative.  He could be a wonderful poet, or perhaps he is already, like Hopkins, whose poetry I admire.  I hope we put the fish back.  Our native woodlands initiative is a good start.  I am engaged with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Last year, Nephin was incorporated into our national park network.  It had been a commercial forest.  Coillte has made a further commitment to my Seeds for Nature initiative.  We are at an inflexion point and the choice on action is ours to make.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan also referred to mushrooms.  My Department will engage in discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the next CAP.  One area of great interest in that context is how to keep farmers farming while providing for them to maintain some of their land for biodiversity without financial loss.  I can agree with the Deputy on the benefits of continuous-cover forestry.  The forest service offers substantial incentives for the planting of broadleaf forests with native species.

While the matter does not fall under his remit, I appreciate the fact that the is here.<\/p>  <p>  This issue relates to Tisrara national school at Four Roads, County Roscommon.  Due to new staffing guidelines, the school is in danger of losing a third teacher in September.  Tisrara is a DEIS school and one fifth of its pupils are members of the Traveller community.  While the schools has a current enrolment of 49, a threshold of 51 will apply for the retention of the existing third mainstream classroom teacher.  Losing a teacher would be detrimental to the fabric of this rural school.  A threshold of 17 pupils applies for the retention of the existing second mainstream classroom teacher in a two-teacher school.  This means Tisrara, which has a projected enrolment of just under 50 pupils for September 2019, will be allocated the same number of mainstream teachers as a school with 17 pupils.  It simply does not make sense.<\/p>  <p>  Tisrara national school's parents' association has fought hard in respect of this matter and a petition from parents, school and community members in support of the retention of the third teaching post has been sent to the Department of Education and Skills.  I urge the Government to re-examine the position.  The extenuating circumstances of Tisrara suggest it should be permitted to hold onto its third teacher or given an extension or grace period in which to increase its enrolment numbers.  The loss of a third teacher would be devastating for the community, particularly the children attending what truly is a fantastic school.  It would be shocking.  The school has 49 students, 13 of whom are in sixth class and will leaving in June.  Ten potential new students are due to enrol for the September 2019-2020 calendar year.  The community would be very disappointed to lose a teacher based on such a shortfall.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, has come across situations like this before.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Education and Skills, he granted an extension period to a certain school in Roscommon following my request.  I am very hopeful that in the circumstances I have outlined, we will be able to do the same in this case.  It is much needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000031#HH00500","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1559224800,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy for raising this important issue.  I know how important this school is to the Deputy.  As he noted, we have all had many cases like this raised with us in the course of our political careers.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who is attending a very important education conference in Washington.  While it is important that he attend the conference, he sends his apologies to Deputy Eugene Murphy for not being here this afternoon.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to set out to the House the position regarding the staffing of primary schools and, in particular, the staffing of Tisrara national school at Four Roads, County Roscommon.<\/p><p>As he is aware, the key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and the pupil enrolments on 30 September of the previous year.  The staffing arrangements for the 2019-20 school year are set out in Circular 0019\/2019, which is available on the website of the Department of Education and Skills.  The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.<\/p> <p> The appointment and retention ratios for small schools - namely, those with up to four classroom teachers - were increased in budget 2012 and improvements to the staffing of these schools have been made in recent years.  Improved retention thresholds for second, third and fourth classroom teachers and the improved appointment and retention thresholds for two-teacher schools situated 8 km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and language of instruction, or both, were introduced for the 2015-16 school year.<\/p> <p> Budget 2017 contained two adjustments in respect of single-teacher schools.  Where a school is the sole primary school on an island, it can appoint a second teacher.  In the context of single-teacher schools with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils generally, a school can apply to the staffing appeals board for a second post where the single teacher has children across six or more class groups.<\/p> <p> Small schools have also benefited from the improvements to the staffing schedule introduced in 2016 and 2018.  Those improvements brought the teacher allocation ratio in all primary schools to the most favourable ever at primary level.  The staffing arrangements include a mechanism for schools to submit appeals under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.<\/p> <p> The school referred to by the Deputy, Tisrara national school, currently has three classroom teachers.  The school also has a special education teacher.  The enrolment required to retain the third teacher, as the Deputy has outlined, is 51 pupils.  On 30 September 2018, the school had an enrolment of 49 pupils and is due to have its teaching staff reduced to two in September.  The school submitted an appeal to the April meeting of the primary staffing appeals board.  In its appeal, the school projected an enrolment of 47 pupils.  As this projection is less than the required 51, the appeal was deemed ineligible by the appeals board.<\/p> <p> As the Deputy knows, the primary staffing appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I emphasise that the primary staffing appeals board will meet again in June, which should be noted, and again in October.  Should the enrolment of the school increase to 51 or more, the school may submit a new appeal to the appeals board for the retention of the third teacher.  I thank the Deputy again for the opportunity to outline this process in the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000031#HH00600","speaker":"1272","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559225400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Some 20% of the current enrolment of the school and the enrolment for the foreseeable future will be made up by members of the Traveller community.

I have checked the position in that regard.  Some 16 pupils receive school support and two pupils receive school support plus.  The Minister of State will understand all of that.  I will not go into the various individual supports because I do not want to bring it down to a personal level but they are all there, they are a fact of life.<\/p>  <p>  Classes comprising 25 or more pupils with diverse educational, physical, emotional and psychological needs place a strain on the commitment required for two teachers to manage and teach those involved.

As stated, there is a further appeals process in June and another in October.  I encourage the board of management of the school or the local community to see if they can attract those extra students necessary to bring the school up to the threshold.  I have advised parents and boards of management in my constituency to do that.  It has worked and the schools in question reached the magic figure of 51.  There has to be a cut-off.  I understand from where the Deputy is coming when he states the school has a lot of issues and is, perhaps, a special case.  However, the same case could be made for many schools in other rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  In a personal capacity, I suggest the parents and the board of management get together and try to get the enrolment up to the magic number of 51.  I accept that it is difficult, particularly in rural areas where there are probably neighbouring schools.  If pupils are taken from one school and enrolled in another, it can create an issue.  There may be parents who wish to send their children to that school.  As the Deputy pointed out, it has a good reputation and is a three-teacher school.  Parents sometimes like to send their children to such schools.  That would be one measure to consider and in respect of which to make another appeal, if possible.  I was disappointed to discover that the numbers have fallen 49 to 47.  In a rural area, it would be much easier to attract two extra children rather than four, but I make that appeal to the Deputy.  I will bring the sentiments he has expressed to the attention of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and outline exactly what he stated regarding the circumstances that obtain at the school.  Everybody wants to ensure that the existing pupil-teacher ratio can retained because this is probably a good school.  The three teachers at the school are doing a good job.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and we will see what can be done.  There is a lot the community can do to see if it can increase the numbers in order to reach the threshold.

I refer to the Presentation secondary school facilities, the Nagle Rice primary school and the lack of places within the former for young children coming out of the latter.  They are unable to get places in the secondary school because there are none.  All of this goes back to the huge population growth in Milltown and the expansion of the town.  Milltown had a population of 401 in 2006, 838 in 2011 and 928 in 2018.  There has also been an increase in the number of houses.  Some 50% of the houses in the town were built in the period between 2002 and 2011.<\/p>  <p>  The admission criteria being applied mean that those who get into secondary school from the catchment area of Milltown need to have historical ties to it, as well as having an older sibling in the secondary school.  The consequences of that are that those coming out of the Nagle Rice primary school who do not have that attachment or who do not have an older sibling in the school have to go elsewhere and attend a secondary school outside Milltown.<\/p><p>Population growth throughout the 18 catchment areas is predicted to be substantial.  The population includes many young couples who in many cases come from ethnically diverse backgrounds, primarily Lithuania and Poland.  They have the added pressure of trying to find a secondary school in the much wider catchment area, which means that they might have to travel to Killorglin, Fieries or elsewhere in the area to find a secondary school.  There is no bus service for those children to bring them to school, which adds cost.  It is absurd that a child who studies in Milltown primary school and resides in the area cannot access secondary education in the town where they were born and live.  It is a terrible cost and having to pay for a bus service to transport a child to another secondary school, due to the criteria, puts a great deal of pressure on the families.  Many of the people come from low-income families, yet they must provide the service.<\/p> <p> The solution is to expand the Presentation secondary school by providing additional rooms to allow it to accommodate children from the area.  While we wait for that to happen, in the short term the Department has an obligation to provide some form of bus funding for children who must travel outside the area.  There is also an urgent need for dialogue with the community.  The current issue is creating division, in that children who were born, reared and are starting school in Milltown are unable to secure a place in their local secondary school, while children born far outside the district are given places because of historical connections.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000032#JJ00500","speaker":"1317","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559226000,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I understand exactly what the Deputy means because even though I am not a Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, I have taken a real interest in this issue because of a similar situation arising in Ennis.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McHugh, who is away on official Government business.<\/p>  <p>  To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographic information system, GIS, with data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places will arise in various parts of the country.  With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Where data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such provision is dependent on the circumstances of each case and as such may be provided through one or a combination of the following, namely, using existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools or providing a new school or schools.  Using school planning area boundaries within the Department&rsquo;s GIS allows data within those boundaries, including data for enrolments in schools, child benefit and other relevant data, to be added to the mapping information, grouped and analysed.  In most cases, school planning areas were based on traditional school catchment areas, where all primary schools were assigned to a post-primary feeder area, typically a population centre or town, containing one or more post-primary schools.<\/p>  <p>  The school planning areas are used in the demographic exercise as a basis for the assessment of areas of growth and to inform recommendations on the establishment of any new schools required in the school planning area.  The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of those schools.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.  The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can together cater for all pupils seeking places.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted.  In schools where there are more applicants than places available, however, a selection process may be necessary.  The process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and applied fairly to all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018, is important legislation that will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils.  The Deputy will further be aware there are three post-primary schools in mid-Kerry, namely, the Presentation secondary school, Milltown, The Intermediate School, Killorglin and Killorglin community college.  The Department has no outstanding applications for capital funding for additional accommodation from the post-primary schools in mid-Kerry, which indicates that the schools are able to cater for their current pupil cohort.

In the area in question, there are three secondary schools - two in Killorglin and one in Milltown.  There is no short-term solution; it must be planned and carefully considered.  In Killorglin, given that there has been an increase in the population of well over 100% in a short period, with the new Irish who live there and a young population, provisions must be made to ensure that the needs and requirements of the parents and children will be realised.  Throughout the area, young children will have to travel to schools outside Milltown but within the catchment area where they can find places.  Some type of funding needs to be provided for children who are unable to attend their nearest school.  That is the short-term solution.  I refer to low-income families, who need such support.  There needs to be dialogue with the community and a commitment to listen.  The Department, civil servants and so on tend not to listen but they need to listen to the community.  There was recently a large meeting attended by hundreds of people, including those from outside Milltown who send their children to the Presentation secondary school because they have historical ties or other children enrolled there, and parents whose children were born and live in Milltown, outside the catchment area, but who are unable to secure a place for them in Nagle Rice secondary school.

Nevertheless, for the benefit of the Deputy, whose point I understand, I appreciate this is a very stressful time for parents and their families, particularly as they await correspondence from secondary schools informing them whether they have secured a place for September.  It is a trying time but we have all seen it for ourselves in our constituency offices.  It is a terrible time for students and their families, which is why it is important that some plan be put in place to help in that regard.  I again refer the Deputy to the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed by the President last July.  It is important legislation that will begin to relieve the situation and it allows for co-operation among the school boards.  I am not sure whether there is full co-operation among the three schools in question but it could be ensured under section 66 of the Act, which relates to co-operation among schools.  It allows schools to share information with one another in respect of applications received, offers made and accepted and so on.  It would help to prevent a situation where one student might be offered a place in more than one school.<\/p><p>This does happen, as the Deputy knows, and it means people delay making a choice.  This is an issue.  There could be data sharing between the three schools during the admission process.  The schools may argue a GDPR issue would arise but people could sign up to it as part of the admissions process.  It would be helpful also because it would give a more even space to students who would know that if they do not take a place, it will go to somebody else.  It is happening.<\/p> <p> The Deputy referred to accommodation.  The Minister has told me the Department will consider any application for interim temporary accommodation should it be required to meet the immediate enrolment needs of any school.  My personal advice to the Deputy, because I have been through this myself, is if accommodation is needed, the Department will consider temporary accommodation based on needs.  The Deputy's question relates to what I have outlined.  The issue of co-operation on school boards is important with regard to data sharing to see who is taking up offers.  It might help to alleviate the situation.  As I said, no application has been made by the three schools for extra accommodation.  Perhaps this is something the Deputy might consider.  I thank him for raising the issue.

I will provide background to my question on whether the Industrial Relations Act 1990 needs to be revised.  Times have changed since it was introduced, as have working conditions and the strength of unions.  How employers treat their workers has also changed.  We have bogus self-employment and all sorts of issues being faced by workers.<\/p><p>Tesco is the largest private sector employer in Ireland and for the past four years it has been trying to break its workers' rights to trade union representation, as I highlighted by raising Project Black in the House in 2017 when the Tesco workers were on strike.  As part of the campaign, Tesco has targeted 180 of its longest serving workers who were all employed before 1996.  They have had pay freezes when everybody else in the company has had a pay increase of at least 8%.  The Labour Court has issued three recommendations on this issue and instructed the company to pay those workers the 8% they are owed, which amounts to &euro;1 million or more than &euro;6,500 each.  This is a lot of money for low-paid workers, many of whom are suffering financially and are experiencing extreme mental health issues as a result of Tesco's actions.  It is also costing the State revenue in terms of expenditure on family income supplement and social welfare support for these workers and in terms of the loss of employers' PRSI, income tax and USC payments.<\/p><p>Why is it that highly profitable companies such as Tesco can make &euro;215 million in profit per year in Ireland alone and can consistently ignore the Labour Court and victimise workers in this way?  Will the Minister of State look at this issue in detail?  In reply to a parliamentary question I asked on Tuesday, the Minister of State said:<\/p><blockquote>Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is based in voluntarism and it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to support the development of an institutional framework supportive of this voluntary system through which good industrial relations can prosper.  In line with the voluntary nature of industrial relations in Ireland, recommendations of the Labour Court made under industrial relations legislation are not binding on the parties although it is expected that the parties involved give serious consideration to the Court&rsquo;s Recommendation.<\/blockquote><p>Not all parts of the Industrial Relations Act are voluntary.  Mandate has a collective agreement with Tesco that places responsibility on both parties to use the WRC and the Labour Court to the best of their ability.  Both parties have always agreed to attend the Labour Court through joint referrals under section 26.  In recent years, Tesco has refused to engage, forcing Mandate to take the most recent case under section 20.  This means the result is binding on the union but the company is free to ignore the recommendations.  They are not binding on the company.  This shows the company is proceeding with its plan to stop recognising unions.  This must be seriously looked at by the committee or the Minister of State.  Does he intend to review the legislation in the light of the changes that have happened in the past 20 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000034#LL00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1559226600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  She has always been interested in industrial relations.  As I have said in reply to parliamentary questions, Ireland&rsquo;s system of industrial relations is essentially voluntary in nature and the responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes between employers and workers rests in the first instance with the employer, the workers and their representatives.  It has been the consistent policy of successive Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of the country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised on freedom of contract and freedom of association.  There are an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments that the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law.<\/p>  <p>  Since 1946, the Labour Court has provided an industrial relations service whereby disputes that parties have been unable to resolve themselves or with the assistance of the Workplace Relations Commission can be voluntarily referred to the Labour Court for an opinion in the form of a recommendation of the court, which, as the Deputy knows, is not binding on the parties.  The vast majority of industrial relations recommendations are accepted voluntarily by the parties.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015, which came into effect on 1 August 2015, provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employment where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect.  It also provides strong protections for workers who invoke the provisions of the 2001 and 2004 Industrial Relations Acts or who have acted as a witness or a comparator for the purposes of these Acts.  It ensures that where an employer is engaged in collective bargaining with an internal excepted body, as opposed to a trade union, that body must satisfy the Labour Court as to its independence of the employer.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation ensures the retention of Ireland&rsquo;s voluntary system of industrial relations.  However, it also ensures that where an employer chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, either with a trade union or an internal excepted body, and where the number of employees on whose behalf the matter is being pursued is significant, an effective framework is in place that allows a trade union to have the remuneration and terms and conditions of its members in that employment assessed against relevant comparators and determined by the Labour Court, if necessary.<\/p>  <p>  While I am amending the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to ensure An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court, I see no case for the Act to be amended regarding the specific issue to which the Deputy has referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000034#LL00300","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1559226600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>The final sentence of the reply should be challenged.  There is a need for the Act to be amended on the specific issue I am raising.  I have said very clearly that Mandate used to use section 26 whereby both parties voluntarily agreed to go to the Labour Court, but Tesco has refused to do this and Mandate has had to use section 20, which is binding on the union but not the employer.  The Labour Court recommendation has been issued three times and the company is completely ignoring it.  What is in the Industrial Relations Act to force the company to pay the 2% increase year on year?  It means the Industrial Relations Act is not working for workers in a fair way.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State is saying this is one case but there is an increasing prevalence of employers refusing to engage with workers through their trade union and an increase in an attitude whereby they are ignoring the State's industrial relations machinery.  This is the State's industrial relations machinery, namely, the WRC and the Labour Court.  In recent years we have had employers such as Tesco, Dunnes Stores, LloydsPharmacy and many other outlets with more than 20,000 workers all ignoring and disrespecting the Labour Court's recommendations.  The Minister of State knows employers and their representatives have been blocking joint labour committees from engaging.  This is a blatant two fingers to the Labour Court, the WRC and the State's industrial relations mechanisms.<\/p><p>As the Minister of State said, Ireland has always had a voluntarist industrial relations model.

The Deputy will know there has been consistency among the social partners, and the terms and conditions of employment of workers have been best determined through the process of voluntary bargaining between employers and employees and between employers' associations and trade unions or staff associations.  This approach has served us well down through the years, which we have seen in a large number of high-profile industrial disputes.<\/p>  <p>  In general, our laws do not try to impose a solution on parties in a trade dispute.  Rather, they are designed to help support the parties in resolving their differences.  There will be differences.  The State has, by and large, confined its role to underpinning voluntarism through the provision of a framework and institutions in order that good industrial relations can prosper.  As I said in my opening statement, the vast majority of industrial relations disputes are settled voluntarily.  Where an employer and employee representatives come together and enter a voluntary agreement to resolve their differences, that is a win-win for both sides.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000035#MM00200","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1559227200,"counter":356,"content":"<p>It is not a win-win in this instance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000035#MM00300","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1559227200,"counter":357,"content":"<p>While I have no direct role in the matter, I stand by the professionalism of the industrial relations machinery of the State, which, as the Deputy knows, are always available to facilitate a solution where both parties are prepared to work in their institutions.

The school has expanded rapidly in the past few years.  It caters for pupils aged between four and 18 years with a mild, moderate and severe to profound learning disability.  Many of these pupils also present with additional needs.<\/p>  <p>  The children enrolling in this school have complex needs and most have co-occurring physical, sensory or emotional needs.  Many also have various syndromes such as Down's and Prader-Willi syndrome, which are life-limiting conditions, and medical issues.  The school serves a broad catchment area which covers Dungarvan, west Waterford, east Cork and parts of south Tipperary.  There are 63 pupils enrolled in the school.  On the basis of projections and inquiries about enrolments, pupil numbers are expected to increase.  I have been informed by the principal that the school building and facilities on offer are no longer fit for purpose.  Staff endeavour to provide the best service possible for their pupils and their families. <\/p>  <p>  The school is awaiting final stage sanction for a new extension.  The staff appreciate the two extensions provided in 2011 and 2015 but following provision under the current application capacity on the site will have been reached.  A long-term solution is needed in order that the school can plan properly for future generations.  As I said, current enrolment stands at 63 but, in September 2019, it will be 72.  There is a waiting list of six for September 2019 and the school is taking inquiries for September 2020.  It is important to make the point that the children on the waiting list do not have the option of applying to another school in the area as their special needs would not be met.  There have been eight inquiries for September 2020 and based on the level of interest this year that number is expected to increase.  It is anticipated that the number of children seeking to enrol in St John&rsquo;s school will continue to increase significantly in the next few years.  It is difficult to predict numbers coming from mainstream school settings but if the pattern of the past few years continues numbers will increase significantly.  <\/p>  <p>  The school is awaiting a decision from the Department of Education and Skills on its application for a third extension.  While the staff acknowledge and thank the Department for the two extensions already provided, the current premises will have reached saturation point on the completion of the new extension and a new school will become necessary.  One wonders if a third extension is value for money when enrolments are expected to increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000035#MM00800","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1559227200,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.

The project was devolved for delivery to the school authority.

In July 2018, this approval was subsequently changed and approval was given to build a two classroom special educational needs, SEN, base, which comprises a full suite of accommodation, including a sensory room and a break out room.  This type of accommodation is more appropriate to the needs of the school and the board of management accepted the revised accommodation brief.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2019 the Department of Education and Skills received costings and plans for the proposed building from the board of management.  The plans submitted included additional floor area and the cost estimate was significantly above the approved grant.

The school's consultant has advised that as the site is restricted it is his opinion that the only viable option is a two-storey structure.

Beimid ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na molta&iacute; sin so it is those recommendations on developments and working conditions in the film industry report which the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht produced after a number of hearings last July.  We submitted it for the lottery to be selected and thankfully it has been.  The report discussed arises from a number of contacts made with other members of the committee.  As I explained, I only came into the role of committee Chairman late last year.  This report already existed.  The committee members had a number of contacts following developments in the film production industry in Ireland.  As well as highlighting the advances and great successes of Ireland's indigenous film industry this report discusses concerns raised by some witnesses which centred around working conditions, training and development, funding and trade union representation.  Having considered the matters, it was given priority by the committee and a number of stakeholders were invited to make a written submission outlining their views on these matters.  The committee heard how the creative film industry is one of Ireland's great strengths.  Irish-made productions are enjoyed by audiences around the world and they enhance our reputation and provide employment.  It is important that the long-term sustainability and development of the sector be enhanced and encouraged.<\/p><p>The cultural and economic value of independent production needs to be continually supported and extended by Government funding incentives such as tax incentives and other funding schemes that are vital for the sustainability of the industry.  Such Government commitment will ensure Ireland's ability to compete against other jurisdictions in getting productions to locate here and to be seen as a territory with strong skills bases, suitable infrastructure and competitive financial incentives.  It cannot be a blank cheque.  There are responsibilities to avail of tax breaks, which is tax forgone from the public moneys.<\/p><p>The committee invited five stakeholders from the industry to come before it and to discuss the topics in question.  The content of these discussions and further written submissions received by the committee form the main content of this report.  I encourage people to look at the full report.  They will see what framed the discussion.  The report deals with the main concerns expressed during the period of consultation between the committee and the stakeholders.  The concerns related primarily to the following four areas: working conditions, training and development, funding, and trade union recognition.<\/p><p>Continuity of employment was raised as an ongoing issue whereby workers are generally employed from production to production and generally do not work on more than one production at the same time.  This is especially the case for those working on section 481 productions for which the mother production company must set up a special production company for newly funded production, referred to as special purpose vehicles, SPVs.  The committee acknowledges the nature of the industry in this regard where film studios and production companies in Ireland and all across the EU, do not generally employ creative and technical talent on a full-time long-term basis and only retain small full-time long-term teams to support a production company or studio in the long run between productions.  That means long periods of lay-offs or unemployment for workers in the industry.<\/p><p>Some instances were highlighted where workers were being engaged as trainees over different productions from year to year and that such training was not leading to offers of full-time employment as new productions came along.  The success of the section 481 funding incentive was leading to substantial increased activity in the industry and part of the scheme insisted on the provision of training on all productions supported by it.  However, the committee was asked how such training could better reflect the overall needs of the industry and be better monitored and recorded.<\/p><p>With regard to funding, the section 481 tax incentive was strongly welcomed, in spite of some of the issues it raised.  However, the importance of restored and guaranteed funding for these bodies and organisations which play a leading role in guaranteeing the future of the sector and in ensuring the long-term sustainability and development of the sector is strongly underlined in the report.  The withdrawal and reduction of funding threatens Ireland's ability to compete against other jurisdictions in getting productions to locate here and this undoubtedly raises challenges and concerns for Ireland's strong reputation as a territory with a strong skills base, a suitable infrastructure and competitive financial incentives.<\/p><p>With regard to trade union representation, during the discussions with the committee, some concerns were raised on workers' representation on unions and other representative bodies and these are reflected in the report.  All of these issues and other topics related to the film industry in Ireland today are reflected in the committee's report and form the basis for the key recommendations.<\/p><p>The importance of the Government's section 481 financial incentive has contributed significantly to the success of the creative industry in Ireland and is crucial to the industry.  However, the committee is very aware how it can lead to some problems for employees as outlined in the four areas I addressed.  There was a question of whether employees are fully protected by legislation and negotiated collective agreements and whether these need to be strengthened.  Concerns could perhaps be first addressed through collective bargaining agreements between employers and their representatives and the trade unions, supported by the dispute resolution procedures of the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.<\/p><p>I will outine the other recommendations made.  Section 481 is a key and central component within the Irish film industry.  This fact is accepted by the vast majority of the industry's stakeholders.  Section 481 should remain central to the industry in the future.  Secondly, it is the view of the committee that the Government should seek to make working arrangements more secure.  Film companies should comply with all labour and other laws in relation to employment and self-employment.  The committee calls on the Government to develop plans that ensure gaps in work are counted towards employment rights and redundancy.  There were concerns with regard to working terms and conditions that can impact on workers, including income, redundancy and pension entitlements.  Terms and conditions can also affect workers' ability to communicate real workplace difficulties as workers without permanent contracts must be constantly rehired.<\/p><p>The committee sought the reform of training in the sector to ensure all training has a recognised qualification, where possible, and a beginning and an end, and that trainees are not forced to repeat specific training.  The committee proposed that there would be a wider geographical spread of training courses, the introduction of formal apprenticeships and additional finance to improve training and development.<\/p> <p> In recommendation No. 4, the committee calls on the Irish Film Board to constitute the board's film forum, with an independent chair, to allow all stakeholders in the sector to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 5 is that an international comparative study be constituted to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the section 481 tax credit.  The committee did not recommend the abolition of the credit, far from it, but its evolution to ensure certain foreign investment is not lost as a result of its current form.  Attention must be focused on how section 481 can be improved to develop rich productive and sustainable indigenous film industry capacity.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 6 is that workers within the craft grades of the industry should have representatives nominated to the Irish Film Board to feed their perspectives and needs into the industry's development.  In recommendation No. 7, the committee called for collective bargaining rights for freelance workers.<\/p> <p> In recommendation No. 8, the committee called for State support for actors, who lead a precarious existence, and sustainable pension structures for workers in the film industry.  In recommendation No. 9, the committee sought further integration of the film industry on a North-South basis with the creation of formal North-South structures, development plans and investment.<\/p> <p> In recommendation No. 10 the committee called on the trade unions and other representative organisations to work towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.  The final recommendation, No. 11, is that public funding and adherence to employment standards be linked.<\/p> <p> The report and its recommendations highlight a number of specific issues which speak for themselves.  I previously stated I was not the Chairman or a member of the committee at the time.  Prior to taking on the role, however, I had a number of contacts with people who work in the film industry and since then I have had much contact with those in the industry.  Some of the accusations levelled against the industry, including blacklisting and shorter working, must be fully investigated.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is the obvious vehicle for doing so.  The committee also suggested that the forum should address specific areas.<\/p> <p> The film industry in Ireland employs a very small number of people.  Overall, the number is estimated to be 17,000 but when one drills down the number employed full-time and throughout the year is fewer than 2,000.  Some people are employed for six months and others are employed for three months.  The industry as a whole is small but many people have an interest in it.  There are probably 17,000 people, or perhaps more, with skills that are utilised in the industry over a period.  They must be protected in every way possible to ensure they have rights as workers and that people can be self-employed if they wish but they must be properly self-employed rather than only in name.  There are solutions to these issues but they require engagement.  The parent companies or the small sub-companies that have been set up to avail of the tax incentive must understand the need to address the issues.  We need to do more.  We are in competition with other countries and do not want international film companies to bypass Ireland because we are not willing to iron out existing difficulties, some of which could be very easily addressed.  Some changes have started to come through, even since the report was published.<\/p> <p> If there are problems with the way Revenue is dealing with the film industry, we must address them but we must do so in a way that protects public moneys.  Any tax incentive is tax forgone and public money.  Where public money is invested, the recipients must be accountable to this institution and also the Revenue Commissioners.  If the investment is designed to create jobs, then such jobs must be forthcoming.  We must also look at whether the investment is developing the industry to a sustainable level so that at some stage in the future it will no longer be dependent on tax incentives.  I recall a major debate about section 481 in 2003 when it was argued that the section was under threat and would be abolished.  Thankfully, it was not abolished because it has sustained and enhanced the film industry.  We must encourage more investment and training in order that we have an industry of which we are proud.<\/p> <p> In the 1990s, SIPTU used to produce a book listing the various people who worked in the industry which could be given to film companies.  Companies could see who was a carpenter or who could do creative, location or site work.  It was a bible for the industry as a whole.  The reintroduction of such a mechanism could be considered.  We must address some of the accusations that have floated around in recent years and find a solution to them or they will continue.  In the main, the recommendations stand.  It is welcome that the industry has already begun to take steps to address some of them but to my knowledge others are still outstanding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000036#NN00300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559228400,"counter":369,"content":"<p>On a procedural point, we are meant to hear next from the Minister for 15 minutes and then have a ten minute wrap-up from her towards the end of the debate.

We are all in agreement that the Irish audiovisual industry is of the utmost importance as part of the cultural, artistic and economic life of Ireland.  My Department shares the objectives of the Oireachtas joint committee to develop the industry, enhance the experience of all stakeholders in the sector, promote growth and see the continued expression of Ireland&rsquo;s creativity through the medium of film in order that it is enjoyed by a global audience.<\/p>  <p>  The report, Development and Working Conditions in the Irish Film Industry, which was published last July, dovetails neatly with the launch of my Department's audiovisual action plan a few weeks earlier in June 2018.  Colleagues will recall that in April 2018, I joined with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to launch my Department's capital investment plan, Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027, which includes the Government's commitment to provide &euro;1.2 billion in capital funding for culture, heritage and our language over a ten-year period.  Of that amount, &euro;200 million is to be invested in media production and the audiovisual industry over the ten years to 2027 as part of the implementation of the audiovisual action plan which aims to make Ireland a global leader in the sector.<\/p>  <p>  An audiovisual steering group was set up to implement the action plan and the steering group comprises all Departments and State agencies involved in the industry.  The steering group will work to implement the eight policy recommendations in the action plan.  The steering group also took on the task of addressing the recommendations of the joint committee's report.  As Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said, the first recommendation emphasises the importance of section 481 to the film industry.<\/p><p>I echo those sentiments.  Section 481 is a key and central component to the Irish screen sector.  Colleagues will be aware that changes were made to this film tax credit in the Finance Act 2018, and were designed to speed-up the time required to decide on applications for relief.  Previously, applications were made directly to Revenue.  Now a producer company applies directly to my Department for a certificate stating the film is to be treated as a qualifying film for the purpose of section 481.  My Department has published guidelines and an application form on the Department website, and the new system has been in effect since 27 March 2019.  <\/p> <p> I was also pleased to note the announcement in the budget speech in October last that the section 481 tax relief for the film industry would be extended beyond its 2020 deadline to 2024.  As the film tax relief is a state aid, the consent of the European Commission is required, and a notification has gone to the Commission, from which a decision is awaited.  <\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 2 of the Oireachtas joint committee report refers to working terms and conditions.  I am pleased to inform the House that this recommendation has been implemented in recent months and since 28 March, all applicants for section 481, including the producer company and the qualifying company, have been required to sign an undertaking that they will comply with their obligations under employment law.  As a condition of certification, the companies must also have in place written policies and procedures regarding grievances, discipline and dignity in work, including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity.  Screen Ireland has also introduced similar conditions for receipt of its funding.  This now links funding to employment standards as proposed in recommendation No. 1.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 3 refers to reform of training.  Last November, Screen Skills Ireland, the training and skills development division of Screen Ireland, held an education forum for the audiovisual industry.  This forum brought together screen industry stakeholders, education and trading providers and policy influencers to focus on the skills development challenges and opportunities.  The forum was a success and will be repeated this year.  In the matter of the training requirements of section 482, changes targeted at improving outcomes have recently been effected.  Deputies may be aware that certification for the tax relief is conditional on delivery of defined levels of training and upskilling.  This requirement has been amended and the focus is now on skills development that is linked to quality and a more expansive range of skills development at all levels, including hard skills, soft skills, future skills, technical skills and leadership skills.  As part of these revised requirements, films with eligible expenditure of over &euro;2 million must have their skills development plans agreed in advance with Screen Ireland.  <\/p> <p> The plans developed by Screen Ireland require applicants to consider carefully the skills needs of the production, the company, the participant and the sector as a whole and to reflect on how the planned activity will address skills needs across different levels and different departments of the production, from new entrants, trainees arid crew to above-the-line talent and company leaders.  This is designed to move away from a system where individuals are labelled as trainees.  It goes some way towards addressing the concerns that the Oireachtas joint committee flagged.  A post-project skills development compliance report must also be submitted to Screen Ireland in order that the impact and outcomes of the training might be captured and quality assured.  <\/p> <p> Screen Skills Ireland and other providers of training can support skills development.  Education providers and Government agencies can work towards developing programmes or systems of accreditation but accreditation of itself does not always guarantee progression.  There is an onus on the industry to facilitate and encourage the organic development and progression of skilled individuals in accordance with their experience.  I am aware, from information relayed to the joint committee in previous sessions, that this already has been the experience of a number of people within the industry.  <\/p> <p> While I am on the topic of recommendation No. 3, I will also set out some of the excellent work that is being done on training and the geographical spread of training courses.  In terms of accredited courses, Screen Ireland has submitted two level 9 courses, namely, creative leadership and advanced producers, to be developed and certified through Springboard.  These courses are in direct response to one of the recommendations in the Olsberg report that new business skills courses be generated that focus specifically on the needs of creative sector companies.  Screen Ireland is also developing a certified level 8 apprenticeship programme for the role of computer-generated imagery, CGI, technical artist in the animation and related sectors.  <\/p> <p> Skillnet Ireland, the national agency for the promotion and facilitation of workforce learning in Ireland, currently has 23 programmes planned for 2019 that are of relevance to workers in the film industry.  These programmes include courses in business skills, leadership and project management through animation Skillnet; design enterprise Skillnet; greas&aacute;n na me&aacute;n Skillnet and screen Skillnet.  A sub-committee of the audiovisual action plan steering group was established earlier this year to oversee the implementation of the recommendations on training and skills in the audiovisual action plan.  The members of this sub-committee are drawn from my Department, Screen Skills Ireland, the Department of Education and Skills, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Their work will be incorporated in to a report on the plan, due to be submitted to me later this year.  <\/p> <p> There are many good examples of training taking place right across the industry.  When Screen Producers Ireland appeared before the joint committee in January 2018, its representatives spoke of the excellent work done by Troy Studios in Limerick in collaboration with Screen Skills Ireland, Limerick Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick and the education and training boards in providing training and many graduates from the immediate surrounds have obtained work in the industry.  We want to see more of these exemplars in the regions and it is expected that the regional film development uplift, for which EU approval is awaited, will do much to promote skills development outside of traditional hubs of film production.  <\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 4 called for Screen Ireland to constitute a film forum to allow all stakeholders to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry.  This has not taken place as not all the stakeholders referred to by the Oireachtas joint committee are prepared to meet as a single forum.  Last autumn, Screen Ireland commenced work to organise a forum with an independent chair as recommended in the Oireachtas joint committee report.  Screen Ireland has independently reported back to the Oireachtas joint committee that it has not proved possible to constitute a forum of all stakeholders.  I agree with the view of Screen Ireland that it seems likely now that, rather than adopting a collaborative inclusive approach in an atmosphere where ideas are exchanged and developed for the good of the industry, the forum probably would constitute little more than the airing of disputes and grievances.  Such issues should, of course, be dealt with through the appropriate mechanisms provided by the State, some of which were mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh earlier, such as the Workplace Relations Commission.  <\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 5 of the report calls for an international comparative study to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of the section 481 credit.  Since publication of this report, as part of its work for the Finance Bill 2018, the Department of Finance published its review of the section, entitled \"Review IV: Cost Benefit Analysis of  Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 - Film Corporation Tax Credit\".  This analysis has been the catalyst for the administrative changes to the application process that I have outlined.  <\/p> <p> In the matter of recommendation No. 6, it is important to note in the first instance that the board of Screen Ireland, under the provisions of the Irish Film Board Acts, is not a representative board in the sense of comprising representatives from the various industry sectors.  Section 12 of the Act provides that seven members shall be appointed to the board by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht with the consent of the Minister for Finance for a period of not more than four years. That said, however, vacancies on the board which arise are advertised by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and anyone who meets the requirements as set out by PAS may submit an application.  There are currently no vacancies on the board.  The next vacancies will arise in March 2020, when three vacancies will arise.  The function of the board is set out in section 4 of the Irish Film Board Act 1980, which states that the board \"shall assist and encourage by any means it considers appropriate the making of films in the State and the development of an industry in the State for the making of films\".  Screen Ireland&rsquo;s mission is to support and promote Irish film, television and animation through fostering Irish artistic vision and our diverse creative and production talent, growing audiences, and attracting film-makers and investment into the country and all members of the board, regardless of their sector of the industry, must work towards that vision.  <\/p> <p> Turning to recommendation No. 8, which comes within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, I would remind the House that the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 was passed in December, which addresses insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.<\/p><p>These measures came into effect on 4 March this year.<\/p> <p> Recommendation No. 9 relates to the integration of the film industry with that in Northern Ireland.  Screen Ireland works with its Northern Ireland counterpart, Northern Ireland Screen, in efforts to attract inward production to the island of Ireland.  In January, for example, Screen Ireland announced that, in conjunction with Northern Ireland Screen, it had teamed up with an international sales and film finance company Bankside Films on a joint venture that intends to produce and fully fund up to two feature films per year.  It targets projects with a budget of up to &euro;1.5 million and creative teams on each project will come from both the North and South.  This is a clear example of continuing co-operation of the film industry on a North-South basis.  It must be acknowledged, however, that Northern Ireland also competes to attract internationally mobile inward production.<\/p> <p> I hope I have given a flavour of the significant advances made by the Government in the audiovisual industry in the ten months since the publication of the Oireachtas committee report.  The Government will continue with the implementation of the audiovisual action plan which delivers ongoing dividends in the industry in line with the overall objectives of Project Ireland 2040.<\/p> <p> A report prepared by the Olsberg SPI and Nordicity consultants and published last year found that the audiovisual and radio sector support approximately 17,000 full-time equivalent jobs and generated a gross value of &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000037#OO01700","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559229600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for updating us on some of the aspects of Oireachtas joint committee report on the film industry.<\/p>  <p>  Today, I attended a meeting in the audiovisual room organised by Deputy Boyd Barrett attended by the workers and members from the industry.  It was disappointing to hear men who had significant experience in the industry, ranging from 12 to 35 years, explaining what has happened since the Oireachtas committee meeting on employment conditions in the industry.  Many of these workers have not got work since.  They are blacklisted as such within the industry.  They explained in detail their situations.  One was a props engineer for 12 years and was classed as a trainee for eight years and has not received any contact from the industry since the committee meeting last year.  They are waiting for phone calls but they do not get them.<\/p>  <p>  Another worker in the industry explained how he and a colleague applied for jobs in the UK, which they got.  However, subsequently, they got a phone call from the same company which told them that it had contacted other companies in Ireland and were told not to take them on because they are on a list.  In an industry with significant potential, everybody should share the money made in it.  The way these men have been treated needs to be challenged.<\/p>  <p>  As legislators and public representatives, we must stand over the fact that a large amount of public money is going into the film industry.  Employment conditions of this nature should be discouraged.  The Minister said progress has been made in that the companies must go through the Department and sign up to certain workplace standards.  However, that does not seem to be the case and I am still quite concerned about it.<\/p>  <p>  One man at the meeting today asked why he and his three colleagues were sacked from the John Player site when they raised the issue of asbestos and health and safety there.  The reply from Screen Guilds of Ireland was horrendous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000039#QQ00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1559229600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>It said he was a troublemaker and could not do his job.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000039#QQ00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1559229600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>He did not receive a verbal or a written warning.  He did not receive an opportunity to reply or appeal.  It was a tense meeting today which reflected what has happened in the industry in the past ten years.  Heretofore there would have been a panel of workers to which the industry could go for a carpenter or a props man.  It allowed for continuous work but the workers in question have not had that in the last period of time.<\/p>  <p>  Last time I spoke on this matter, I raised the issue of trainees.  There seems to be some movement on that but there are still many outstanding issues.  The right of workers to organise into their own trade union and have the right to be able to negotiate with the industry is crucial.  There should be panels separate from the production companies from which available workers and trainees can be allocated.<\/p>  <p>  Despite what the Minister said, there is a need for this forum to take place with an independent chair which can deal with these issues.  One cannot have a situation where a considerable number of expert workers in the field are being blacklisted.  I cannot stand over that as a public representative and legislator with public money going into the industry.  If the forum does not go ahead, funding to the film industry should be stopped like what happened in the Abbey Theatre when there were issues around workers&rsquo; rights there.  That got everybody to the table quickly.  Action of that nature needs be taken with this forum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000039#QQ00400","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1559229600,"counter":390,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for facilitating the meeting earlier on in the audiovisual room which I attended.  It was an opportunity to hear the issues.  At times it was a difficult meeting, and at times it was acrimonious, because allegations were made by individuals against others.  The point was made that it is not our role to act as adjudicators on such issues when there are resolution mechanisms available.  It is surprising those mechanisms have not been used already.<\/p>  <p>  It is obvious that there are deeply held views on both sides.  Both sides brought passion to the meeting, as well as showing their commitment to develop the film industry.  It is vital that a process is found to address those issues and find a resolution because it can be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  Issues came out at the meeting about the application of employment legislation.  Is it being adhered to and, if not, what are the consequences regarding government funding to the industry?  Abbotstown was mentioned as an example.  The new guidelines from the Department of Finance regarding accountability were raised.  There was a discrepancy about statistics and the numbers employed in the industry.  Questions were asked about the formation and role of the guilds, along with training, certification, fixed-term workers, the quality of the employment and protection workers.  Questions were also asked about when issues of health and safety are raised, pension rights, the role of those labour relations mechanisms and the role of the unions.  There is more than one union involved which brings up a person's right to join a union of their choice.  There is also the right to peaceful protest and, therefore, a viable complaints procedure.<\/p>  <p>  An issue was also raised about those from the film industry who gave testimony at the Oireachtas committee some time ago and the way in which they are treated now.  On the allegations of bullying, blacklisting and blackballing, there must be process in which those issues can be addressed.  Maybe these are matters for the Garda.<\/p><p> It is accurate to say that in Ireland we are very proud of the film industry and the work that has been produced over many years.  We know the extent of the work and the great variety of skills that go into film-making.  Sometimes we are prone to consider only the actors, directors and camera people but there is so much more involved.  It was good to hear this morning from representatives of people with those different skills that go in to making a film.  That skills basis is vital for attracting productions to locate here.  There is also increased demand for screen content worldwide; I only have to mention Netflix.  That is why it was disturbing to hear of the acrimony between the two groups working in the industry.  Deputy Boyd Barrett&rsquo;s used the words \"raging dispute\" in terms of what we saw this morning, yet pillar 4 of the Creative Ireland programme aims to make Ireland a centre of excellence for media production.<\/p> <p> I acknowledge the correspondence from Screen Producers Ireland, the work it has been doing and the work on the self-assessment model.  It also mentioned producers&rsquo; obligations with respect to employment legislation and skills development.  Its correspondence referred to a collective agreement and the work it is doing.  What it is saying, in a sense, is that nearly everybody is saying the same thing with respect to the needs in the industry.  There is so much common ground and interest in the film industry it beggars belief that there is acrimony.  <\/p> <p> The forum has been recommended but it is taking too long.  Like my colleague, I do not agree with the Minister when she said it is not possible to have a collaborative approach now.  I believe it is possible.  Everybody at the meeting in the AV room this morning said they were willing to take part in a forum.  It will be challenging for the forum but there is a willingness to engage.  It will need a skilled chairperson or negotiator.  There is probably a need for separate negotiations initially and then for the different sides to come together.  It is terrible to use the word \"sides\" but this issue has to be resolved in the end and all of us have to be on that one side, which is for the betterment of the industry and for all those who work in it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000039#QQ00500","speaker":"1291","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559230200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>In recent years, the film industry and the film production sector has expanded in a positive way.  This is as a result of a number of big-budget TV dramas produced in Ireland which started with \"The Tudors\" more than a decade ago.  As a result, Ireland is the 17th most popular location in the world for filming TV shows and movies, according to a recent study.  Considering the size and scale of Ireland by comparison with the countries ranked higher than Ireland, this is something of which we can be proud.<\/p>  <p>  The report seeks to examine some of the issues which have arisen alongside this request, including concerns regarding section 481 relief, the conditions of workers and the precarious nature of employment within the sector.  It is welcome that since this report has been published, changes have been made to section 481 to encourage the development of skills in the sector and to support better recognition and formalisation of training within the industry.  <\/p>  <p>  That said, a number of issues have arisen in respect of section 481 relief in the past few months.  Despite the Government&rsquo;s claim to be supporting the industry, it is extremely disappointing the film industry is being put under considerable pressure in recent months as a result of delays in the introduction of new regulations for section 481 relief.  These changes were well flagged months in advance and yet it is at least ten months since Revenue started working on this issue before draft guidelines were provided.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the progress made in recent weeks but believes that the process should not be repeated.  We would welcome clarification by the Minister on the indicative timeline for the completion of guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  Other outstanding issues, including the regional uplift, have not been addressed either.  The Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Finance must clarify the position with regard to the regional uplift elements announced last year.  Five months into 2019, they are still not available to the sector.  It is unfair on the sector to announce supports which are then not made available within the specified timeframe.  The regional uplift is on a temporary basis and simply not available at this point in time.  The Minister should provide a clear timeline for when the regional uplift element will be available.  It is somewhat ironic that an incentive to encourage the development of the industry risked causing damage by the delay.  The film industry has achieved international regard and competes on the same level as production companies in Los Angeles or London.  This cannot be allowed to continue any further.  The sector has made great strides in recent years and the Government must strive to ensure this continues.  While progress has been made in recent weeks, more is needed before the Government delivers on its announcements in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  The report examined terms and conditions and the precarious nature of work in the sector but, unfortunately, it appears that some of the issues raised at committee hearings have not been progressed much further.  When this report was completed, the committee called on the unions and the representative organisations to work together towards a mutually beneficial and respectful understanding.  It was clear at a briefing in the AV room earlier that significant, focused work will be required.<\/p>  <p>  I compliment Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett on organising that meeting.  The Minister has heard from Deputies across the House that there are entrenched and polarised views on the way workers are treated in the industry.  Those in various sectors, whether it be in carpentry, costume or make up, have valued skill sets and are artistic in their own right but there is a sense that their work is not valued and that there is an avoidance almost of respect and due regard for the workforce.  As my colleagues said, we heard personal accounts of people who have been in the industry for some time but they have not reaped any rewards for their length of service or dedication to their work.  We also heard from the guilds today whose representatives made the case that they are working and striving towards making provision to address some of the issues that were raised at committee meetings, whether it be training or providing the support mechanisms that should be in place for this particular sector, but I agree with my colleagues that there is a need for some intervention through a mediator and a facilitator to find common ground and ensure there is due regard and respect for the workers involved.  <\/p>  <p>  I disagree with the Minister's comments that the forum is not the place to provide for that.  Anywhere that common ground can be found is of major importance.  Nothing can be resolved without conversation and round-table discussion.  I encourage the Minister in any way she can to try to fulfil what is required by allowing those voices to be heard and having due regard to the workers within that industry without crippling those who are trying to keep these projects up and running.  While there has been major investment, anybody who has come from an arts background knows that way that funding is allocated, and projects and films are no different in that they are financed from project to project, which can be difficult.  We must be mindful of both sides of the argument.  I ask the Minister in her work, deliberations and any input she can make to ensure that both voices are heard and that an amicable agreement can be found.  There is a lot of work to be done to ensure there is respect for people's work and service and the industry is not impacted negatively because of the conflict that prevails.<\/p>  <p>  I have no doubt Deputy Boyd Barrett will put it in a more aggressive way than I can but aggression can only get us so far.  We must find an amicable way of resolving these issues, hear both sides and find the middle ground in order to move forward and allow the industry to flourish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000040#RR00200","speaker":"1271"},{"type":"speech","time":1559230200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>We need people to talk to each other in this industry.

A prominent international actor who is also a producer sought to employ somebody here to work in transport on a movie and was informed by the Irish producer company that it could not have and was not willing to employ that person.  This is clear evidence of a blacklist.  Think about the consequence of that for this prominent international actor, all of the people whom actor knows and international investors who might be considering coming into this country.  That is as serious as it gets.  Unless the Government proactively resolves this, we have a serious problem and we had better acknowledge it.<\/p> <p> The other day I met a well known playwright, probably one of Ireland's leading playwrights, with whom I am friendly.  We were chatting about the conflict in the Abbey.  I mentioned the raging battle that is going on inside the film industry and he said something very interesting.  He said that in his experience, if one got a lot of creative people and people working in the arts in one room with a pot of money, the result was not pleasant.  This was an interesting comment to hear from one of our leading playwrights and, when one thinks about it, a very disappointing comment to hear.  One would expect that the arts is totally different from that, that it is the opposite of that, and that it is better than everywhere else in how people work together, how they co-operate and how they engage with each other.  One would expect it is the best of any industry and sector.  That is what one would hope for.  That is what it should be.  Art is supposed to be about the best of us, and instead we have a bitter toxic situation in the Irish film industry.  It must be resolved.  That forum has to happen.<\/p> <p> Members should consider where this stands in the scale of things.  We have just had a major national scandal over what was going on in the FAI leading to a clear-out of the chief executive, etc., because the chief executive lent the FAI &euro;100,000.  The annual subsidy from the State to the FAI is only &euro;9 million.  This was a major national scandal and has led to a complete clean-out of the FAI.  Between section 481 tax relief and Irish Film Board or Screen Ireland funding, there is &euro;100 million going into this industry every year.  This puts the FAI in the ha'penny place.  If the allegations that are being made have any substance, and there is quite a lot of evidence to suggest they may have, somebody has to adjudicate on all of that and it has to be independent.  While it is not up to us, the Government, which is the funder of the industry, has to make that happen.  What is more, a condition of giving out further funding of that scale has to be that the recipients respect the public who are funding them and agree to come into a forum where these issues will be resolved.  Anything less is completely unacceptable.<\/p> <p> The Minister states the Government decided that because different stakeholders were unwilling to go into a room with one another, it was not possible for them to talk, she could not have the forum, and we should just accept that.  That is crazy.  Is that the way we would have operated if the former CEO of the FAI had stated he would not come in to the Oireachtas committee and it should get lost, as some of the stakeholders have done?  Would the public have accepted that?  The Government would not have accepted it.  It is totally unacceptable.  This forum has to happen.<\/p> <p> I was slightly worried by the Minister's response and I hope she will reconsider.  I understood from engagements that I had with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, in that regard that she was in favour of the forum happening and the only outstanding question was whether we had an independent chair.  A couple of suggestions I would put forward, and these are not exhaustive, would be Mr. Kevin Duffy, the retired chair of the Labour Court, or possibly Mr. Brendan Hayes, the retired deputy chair.  Members could have other suggestions but they should be persons who have experience in industrial relations and who will be genuinely independent in bringing people into a room and look at all of this.<\/p> <p> It has to be a condition of further funding that the law is being applied and workers' right are not being abused.  We have not got to the bottom of whether this is so, but let us ask ourselves a simple question.  Could the Minister answer the question as to who the employees in the Irish film industry are?  I suspect that the Government cannot answer that question.  No one knows who the employees are because none of them has any rights.  They do not exist.  The vast majority of the workers do not have a contract of indefinite duration that is acknowledged by the people who receive the funding.  They do not exist, even though the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act  2003 clearly applies to them.  The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has accepted that this law applies and yet it is not being applied in the industry.  Therefore, it has to happen.  I do not believe further funding can be extended to this industry until it is clear that is happening.<\/p> <p> I refer not only to future practice.  We must establish the position of those who have been working.  Today, we got testimony from people working 42 years in the industry, 25 years in the industry, etc.  On the issue of blacklisting, there are ways to find this out.  All of those workers have submitted their PPS numbers to me and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  Others will submit them.  We can simply establish whether they have been blacklisted since they came in here.  There cannot be too many people claiming they are not working in the industry all of whom are lying, but there is a way to find out.  One can check their PPS numbers, their employment record, whether they have worked in the industry for years, who they worked for, whether those people were in receipt of public money and whether they have got rights as employees.  These details can be established and we can find out who is telling the truth.<\/p> <p> What we heard today from Screen Guilds of Ireland was shocking.  When one of those workers, a master painter who has worked for 42 years in the industry, asks why he was sacked from a particular production with two other people and the answer from Screen Guilds of Ireland is because he is a troublemaker and he should have been doing his job, that is breaking the law.  Where somebody who is sacked on that basis, his or her rights are being breached and the law is being broken.  The people who did that are in receipt of public money, which is conditional on the provision of quality employment and training.  That cannot be allowed to stand.<\/p> <p> I want to make clear I not only want &euro;100 million to go into the Irish film industry, I genuinely want &euro;200 million to go into it.  That has been my party's policy for many years.  However, I do not believe a single cent more should go in until we know who are the trainees, who are the employees, whether there are proper pathways into the industry, and until we log, track and ensure that there is quality employment and training.  Anything less is completely unacceptable.  Is there recognition of service?  If somebody who has worked in the industry for 25, 30 or 35 years does not have a job, a pension or any rights whatsoever, that is not acceptable.  That is not quality employment and training and nobody can seriously suggest that it is.  I have much more to say and just do not have time to say it.<\/p> <p> We have a problem and the way to solve it is to convene the forum.  Quite frankly, anybody who tells the Government, particularly if he or she is receipt of public money, that the person is not coming should be told he or she will not get a single cent more.  One should bear in mind that we were given evidence at the Oireachtas joint committee by the people who were lobbying to continue the funding that there were 17,000 jobs.  The Irish Film Workers Association and the GMB stated there were not 17,000 jobs, that there were 2,000 and that those jobs were not actual jobs but were completely precarious with no security.<\/p><p>Revenue looked into the claims of the two sides and found that the Irish Film Workers Association and the GMB union representations were the correct ones.  There were only 2,000 jobs, of which only 900 were PAYE, and almost none of them are people who have any security from one job to the next.  They can work in the industry for 20 years and then they are just gone.  It is not acceptable and we now have evidence piling up.  It was because of the campaigning of the workers who gave testimony today that the new guidelines were brought in and why we had the report.  We have to take these things seriously and get to the bottom of them.  Funding to the film industry has to be conditional on the application of the law and the upholding of workers' rights for the good of the industry, as I have explained.  Otherwise, its international reputation will be absolutely shot if it seems that rights are being flouted like that and blacklisting and other sorts of completely unacceptable behaviour are rife in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000040#RR00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559231400,"counter":398,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta.

The role of the D&aacute;il is to ensure film-making thrives in Ireland and in an environment where people's rights are protected.  The previous speaker evidenced conflict, which would pretty much indicate a breakdown.  It is welcome that the Deputy mentioned several people who might be acceptable as chair and who have long experience of conflict resolution in employment matters.<\/p>  <p>  Our modern film industry very much rests on the foundation created by the first Minister for culture in the State, Michael D. Higgins, who was a member of a Labour Party Government some time ago.  It was a condition of the Labour Party going into government that we would create a Department and Minister for culture.  I am aware that the previous speaker rarely praises the Labour Party, but the approach in developing cultural institutions in Ireland by our now President, Michael D. Higgins, was largely based on profound respect for people who are involved in what might be described as the creative industries, of which film-making is definitely one.  As we know, there are now associated developments in areas like video and media in general.  We also have to recognise that this is now a globalised industry, based on a particular model.  Irish film makers who want to be successful on a global stage must work within that environment, which is not always perfect, from an Irish point of view.<\/p>  <p>  It is a complex issue.  It is welcome that the previous speaker put forward a number of names of people with long experience of trade unions and dispute issues in an effort to find a resolution, which is positive.<\/p>  <p>  The critical role of the State in recent times relates to section 481.  That is a key funding element for the industry.  We are all aware - I have raised this issue on many occasions - that that tax break funding in effect should go to real productions which have an output that can be verified.  In that context, I bring attention to a Private Members' Bill I produced more than a year ago on tax law reform and codification, and the creation of the structure in regard to our tax which would continuously review, examine, question, and audit developments in tax that may lead to tax not going for tax breaks for the purposes intended, but which go unexamined and for which a permanent review mechanism is not provided.  Within the Revenue Commissioners, permanent examination takes place of people involved in film making, whether in a company, a contractor or an employee format, according to the different elements of the tax code.  The core funding finance port to the film industry in Ireland is through section 481 and there was broad agreement here, including from the previous speaker, to continue the section 481 mechanism.  As I said, I have brought forward a Bill that would allow that examination over a range of tax breaks, not just the film break, to see if they remain relevant and give taxpayers value for money and a return.  I would welcome the support of some of the parties who are being critical of section 481, but have also indicated that they support it as a continuing funding mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  It is a globalised industry and is not simply confined to the island of Ireland.  We have also discussed what is happening in Northern Ireland.  As to the creative culture in this country, areas like screen writing, film making and film production are vital to the film industry.  I know many people who work in the film industry.  In some cases, they are happy to be private contractors while in other cases they want employee status.<\/p>  <p>  When I was Minister for Social Protection, I set up a working group to look definitively at this whole area.  It took us several years to get the Government to publish that report, even though it had been signed off on by the relevant Departments, and those months of delay ran into several years.  We now have more capacity, as an Oireachtas, to provide oversight.  I would welcome support for the Labour Party's Bill which is sitting in cold storage, to use the current political term, because it relates to tax and the money message issue.<\/p>  <p>  I do not believe there is just one solution.  The second issue, about which I have spoken previously, is training people in the industry and I include in that degree courses.  In journalism, which in some ways is a parallel and related industry, that the amount of traditional employment available is diminishing because of the advance of technology and social media.  Similar things are happening in the film industry.  It is important that where dedicated people, particularly young people, are doing a four-year degree and perhaps a masters degree, we have a structure of serious and meaningful work experience for them in the industry.  There are very talented people who may get lucky breaks or who may have contacts in the industry.  As with many artistic and craft areas, there is a high degree of connectivity in the industry, where people have relations, parents, or people their parents know, and they seem to have access.  I worry about people from working class areas who are really talented, but do not have those familial connections.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Broughan, who is in the Chair, is a former teacher and will know what I am talking about in terms of my constituency and his one, where the talent is just as intense on the ground as it is in places like south County Dublin.<\/p><p>They have the connections.  Kids who live on and students from the north side often do not have them.  It would be welcome if people with Kevin Duffy's reputation got involved, if he were willing to do so; it would be a big job.  He produced the report on apprenticeships.  Apprenticeship used to be a traditional route into the industry for people who really wanted to work in it and still is in areas such as camera work and lighting.  There is a need for more opportunities for students from DEIS schools or more traditional working class backgrounds who do not have parental connections.  They should have a fair opportunity to contribute to the industry and bring their creativity to all of us and the general population.  <\/p> <p> I am anxious about the issue of education in the context of the report.  There are extensive courses available, but at times one worries that there are not enough employment opportunities arising from them or specific training opportunities.  If we could address that issue, we could resolve some of the difficulties that have been spoken about.  If all else fails, we should bring back President Michael D. Higgins to give some encouragement and advice.  We all want to see people working with proper pay and conditions.  They should be able to use their creativity not only for their own benefit but also to add incredibly to the cultural richness and experience of the country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000042#TT00400","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1559232000,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I will address briefly some of the points raised by Deputies.

As she is probably aware, the new conditions in respect of section 481 require recipients of public money to observe all employment laws.  The onus has been placed on recipients to prevent bullying between workers involved in productions.  I also point out to the Deputy that Screen Guilds of Ireland members are workers in the film industry, not employers.  I reiterate that the film forum was never meant to be a place where disputes would be resolved.  That has never been its purpose.  How does it differ from what occurred in the AV room today, for example?  The Deputy mentioned section 481 with reference to the written policies that have to be in place on grievances, discipline and dignity at work, including harassment, bullying and equal opportunity.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Boyd Barrett raised points that were also raised by other Deputies.  There is a mistaken belief overall as to what constitutes a film forum.  This was borne out by a letter I received from the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, in which it asked that I set up a film forum to allow organisations to address allegations of bullying.  The committee proposed a film forum \"to allow all stakeholders to meet and work together to develop mutually beneficial solutions for the industry\".  It appears that rather than adopting a collaborative, inclusive approach in an atmosphere where ideas are exchanged and developed for the good of the industry, the forum would involved little more than an airing of disputes and grievances and that we cannot work together to develop solutions which would benefit the industry.  In any case, as we know, the State provides institutions to addressing HR issues such as allegations of bullying.  Deputy Boyd Barrett organised the meeting today.  The people who refused to enter the forum are employees and workers in the industry.  Representatives of the producer companies that receive section 481 relief will attend the forum if employees attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000043#UU00800","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1559232000,"counter":409,"content":"<p>We do not know who the employees are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000043#UU00900","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1559232000,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Deputy Smyth mentioned regulations and timelines for the giving of guidance.

I apologise if I am skipping through my notes a little.  <\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is incorrect in saying workers have no rights.  That is an incorrect and non-factual statement.

I thank the Members who took part in the debate and gave some of the issues a good airing.  I apologise that I was not able to attend the meeting in the AV room earlier.  It seems I was in three places at once, such is the nature of the scheduling of business here.<\/p>  <p>  An rud at&aacute; uaimse, agus glacaim le gach Ball a labhair go dt&iacute; seo, n&aacute; go go mbeidh tionscal maith againne maidir leis an scann&aacute;na&iacute;ocht sa t&iacute;r seo ionas go mbeidh postanna maith ann, go bhfuil scann&aacute;in den scoth ann agus go mbeidh muid ag f&eacute;achaint ar thraen&aacute;il mhaith do dhaoine a bheadh ag dul isteach sa tionscal seo amach anseo, agus go bhfuil si&uacute;d at&aacute; ann ag cur leis na scileanna at&aacute; acu.

Much has started to be addressed in terms of skills and upskilling, certification and so on.  We will wait and see, but already it seems to be paying some dividends for those who are trying to enter the film industry and those who are already within it.<\/p>  <p>  Employment protection was mentioned by the Minister.  There are protections for employees, but there is a problem is availing of them if a company no longer exists.<\/p><p>This is one of the issues to which we can return to when the forum is established.<\/p> <p> It will not be a grievance forum.  The Minister is correct on that point.  However, the underlying issues behind the grievances need to be addressed rather than dealing with issues on a case-by-case basis .  Many of us have met the workers.  They have raised issues such as bullying, blacklisting and blackballing.  These issues are not all on one side.  Accusations have also been made against those who have highlighted them.  Those are matters for the Labour Court, the Workplace Relations Commission or a mediator.  Some of the matters raised are covered by employee protections.<\/p> <p> I did not hear much commentary regarding displacement.  People who worked in this industry for many years are now being displaced because their jobs no longer exist.  Young people have come into the industry and then been unemployed for two or three years.  They have no mechanism to get back into employment.  There have been suggestions that blacklisting is to blame.  That might be the case but it might also be displacement.  If it turns out that displacement is the real cause, there has to be a mechanism to ensure that there is a route back into the industry for those affected.  If people are unemployed because of blacklisting, then that is illegal and it needs to stop.  I said as much when representatives from the Abbey Theatre were before the committee.  Every right-thinking person would agree with me in this regard.<\/p> <p> We want people to be able to go to work, have dignity and be compensated for their work.  It does not matter if it is the film industry or another industry, we have an obligation to ensure we put the legislation in place to protect pay and conditions.  That is what the report suggests.  It recommends mechanisms to overcome these difficulties.  Most of those recommendations are being addressed.  This is going to happen in time.  It seems that this one area is not being addressed and if this was happening in any other industry, someone would be appointed to examine the issue.  I do not like using the term \"sides\", but a mediator should be appointed to ensure both parties sit down together.  That is the purpose of a mediator.  When the issue arose in the Abbey Theatre, all those involved were encouraged to sit and get on with addressing the issue.<\/p> <p> A stronger industry results from that kind of approach.  We can ensure we have the best film industry by adopting said approach.  We must do that because every country is working on the same basis and is trying to protect jobs.  There is an understanding that films in Ireland have to be made to the highest of standards because we are in competition with many other countries.  We do not want more job losses, displacement or the industry disappearing altogether.  I have received correspondence from many workers in the industry.  Some wrote to praise the work of the committee while others were aghast at what was said.  People are speaking from personal experience and not telling lies.  It might not be the experience of those who were aghast.  They might have another tale to tell and they should tell it.  People should be allowed to outline what has happened to them.<\/p> <p> Action needs to happen on this issue quickly because livelihoods are at stake.  The main breadwinners of some families are not working in the industry of their choice.  It is an industry in which they have developed an extensive skill set over the years.  In many cases, those skills are not transferable.  Much attention is being paid to this issue.  I ask those listening to get down to work and help deal with the real underlying issue within this industry.  Some of the big issues have been dealt with but some of the animosity that has been created needs to be addressed.  People need to be back in work and we need a proper industry with no major problems in the background.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019053000043#UU01300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1559232600,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1559232600,"counter":416,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 6.05 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 June 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
