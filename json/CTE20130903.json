I welcome Mr. David Duffy, chief executive officer with Allied Irish Banks.  Mr. Duffy is accompanied by Mr. Bernard Byrne, director of personal and banking business, Mr. Myles O'Grady, acting chief financial officer, and Mr. Brendan O'Connor, head of financial solutions group.  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Duffy will make some opening remarks which we will follow with a question and answer session.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off as even on silent mode they interfere with television broadcasting.  I ask that they be put either on airplane mode because we might take off this afternoon or on silent mode.<\/p><p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p><p>  When Mr. Duffy has concluded his opening statement we will allow 15 minutes per designated speaker for the first round of questions, ten minutes for the next round of questions and five minutes for the round of questions after that.  Some groups may wish to divide their times in those allotments.  <\/p><p>  I welcome Mr. Duffy and his colleagues.  The last time they were before the committee was eight or nine months ago.  At that time it was apparent that the banks did not have specific targets with regard to how they would resolve their distressed mortgage book.  Since then the targets have been set out, with a target figure of 20% by the end of June and 50% by year's end.  The Members and I would be very grateful if Mr. Duffy could be cognisant in his presentation as to the way those figures reflect AIB's meeting of that target and how they break down.  I thank Mr. Duffy for coming before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300003#E00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378213200,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I will make a few comments and try to keep them as brief as possible to allow time for what I know will be an extensive discussion.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to spend time here because I know that the matters tabled for discussion are material, significant and, in some cases, traumatic.<\/p><p>  I remind the committee of AIB's role as we have articulated it, and we have outlined it in our note.  The primary role is the support of the Irish economy through lending in mortgages and in the world of small and medium enterprises, SMEs, but obviously, given the circumstances, another key activity has to be engaging in the restructuring of mortgage arrears and SMEs.  Behind all of that we have to have a mind to returning AIB to sustainable profitability as, ultimately, that leads to a return of funds to the taxpayer.  Last but by no means least, we have to make sure that we provide excellent service to the customer, whether in distress or in growth orientation.<\/p><p>  With regard to the specific performance, we have published our results so I do not intend to go through those in great detail.  As a headline we have returned to pre-provision operating profit and there is a general improvement in all elements of the business.  With that in mind we have restructured our balance sheet.  We have a very deep cost-cutting programme, and we have seen a steady demand for lending, some of which we will go through today.<\/p> <p>We are particularly focused on investing in the technology side of a banking model.  Our overall post-provision loss has been reduced by 40%, our customer accounts have increased by &euro;1.2 billion for the year and we have added more than 90,000 customers during the year thus far.  Our bad debt provisions, that being a forecast of what we think the liabilities will be in the future for arrears and other matters, fell by 53% and our cost programme has led to a reduction of 14%.  Our headcount has reduced from slightly more than 15,000 to 12,700 and continues to decline.  Our loan-to-deposit ratio and all the other metrics that are highly important to the troika have equally declined and we have largely finished with the deleveraging of &euro;20.5 billion of non-core assets.  At the same time, we have a core tier 1 ratio of 15.1%, which is material to both now and the future of Basel III calculations.  We have reduced our ECB funding by another 20% in the six months to June 2013.<\/p><p>   Lending has been a primary focus for a huge portion of the bank.  If one looks at the last two years, we have lent &euro;14 billion between 2011 and 2012.  This will be the acid test as to whether AIB is delivering into our primary activity, which is supporting the growth of the economy.  Against this background, we have lent &euro;3 billion in the first six months of 2013.  We have seen an increase in the number of SMEs borrowing but a smaller number - in terms of quantum - of amount borrowed.  This signifies some health a little bit, in that there are more people looking to grow but they are borrowing against cash flows and more sensible amounts that businesses can afford perhaps, rather than against collateral, be it property or otherwise.<\/p><p> AIB has a lot of activity around the sectors and is very focused on conducting national surveys, which members will have seen regarding agriculture, among others.  The key is to get a national understanding, rather than a small survey understanding, by region of what are the key drivers and to tailor our offerings towards that.  We have the largest pipeline of lending we have seen in several years and a lot of discussion is ongoing with SMEs at present.  AIB has approved &euro;2.2 billion in lending just to SME and corporate customers thus far this year.  AIB's market share in mortgages has been a key focus for the bank and it has moved from 28% to 46% over the past year.  If one looks at drawdowns, which are a reflection of the actual spend of mortgages, AIB has 40% of the entire market.<\/p><p> I will turn to the issue of arrears, which I acknowledge will give rise to an extensive discussion.  Our strategy remains precisely what it has been before, which is to keep people in their homes and to prioritise mortgage debt.  We are acutely aware - and are not just saying this but in practice - of the circumstance of how difficult this is from a human and social perspective.  We have exceeded our targets set by the Central Bank and will go into some detail on this, as I believe we will be required to do.  We have a wide range of the resolution options, so all the regulatory-approved options are being offered by the bank.  The engagement with our customers has increased by 30% in the first half of this year.  Moreover, AIB has made 12,500 offers of solutions in addition to our active day-to-day management, which I will discuss, and 4,400 permanent solutions have been implemented.  I remind the joint committee that the regulatory targets are for offers and not for resolution.  There is an important discussion in this regard, as while the resolution in some simple cases is very straightforward and can be done in a month or two, in other cases with multi-debt connections, it can last six to 12 months as we work through pieces.  Consequently, for the avoidance of doubt as I speak to the numbers, when the regulatory targets are published they are about making offers of sustainable solutions.  I wish to avoid confusion in this regard.  While we also will speak to solutions already executed, that is to be clear.  We have dedicated a significant amount of resources and this has not changed.  In fact, it has been increased.  While it is a time-consuming process, we have endeavoured to be as aggressive as we can in terms of getting to satisfactory solutions for the customers and will give the joint committee some details of that.<\/p><p> In respect of strategic default, there has been a lot of talk about it and what is meant by it.  We talked about our portfolio and raised this issue.  It is never going to be popular but I wish to provide some substance to the commentary we made.  If one considers our portfolio, 80% of it is paying normal amounts on the full mortgage.  Consequently, one is talking about the 20% that is not doing so.  It is of that 20% that we think that up to 20% or more could be making decisions not to prioritise the mortgage payment.  In other words, in that context, one is really talking about 4% of the book, that is, 20% of those who are in arrears.<\/p> <p>As to where we have come up with those numbers, if one considers the overall portfolio, I will provide members with some examples.  Under the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, programme, everyone is required to submit a standard financial statement which goes through all of the income and expenditures of a person when he or she submits it.  Within the past year, 25% of those indicate that the customer is able to afford their mortgage.  Therefore, one in four of the customers who have provided a statement back to us shows that from their net disposable income - here I want to be clear that we define net disposable income as the income after reasonable living standards, which in our case are defined as 20% above the ISI guidelines, that is, one takes the reasonable living standards that have been published, adds 20% and then judges affordability - they were still able to afford their mortgage.  I can go into that in more detail.  That is a case where it seems to us, where one has the reasonable living standards nationally defined plus 20% and one is not making one's mortgage payment, that is a decision one has consciously made.<\/p><p> One in four of our buy to lets have paid zero in six months.  If one looks at that population who have paid zero, they have net disposable income calculations but it is based on an income that was allocated in rent through that property.  Therefore, an individual borrowed from us for an investment property or a buy to let, and he or she has a tenant who is paying rent, and for the vast majority that is the case, and in those circumstances, the landlord is making zero payments and diverting the rent.  For us, that is a conscious decision not to pay or prioritise one's mortgage payment.<\/p><p> The last item to mention is that in excess of 2,000 customers, in all of the discussions we have had with them, have evidenced deposits which are significantly in excess of their arrears.  We look at it and say that where a person has cash on deposit - non-current accounts in the financial system - and it is in excess of the arrears, we view that as a conscious decision not to pay or prioritise one's mortgage payment.  I hope we will have more discussion on that.<\/p><p> What we are really saying is we are not trying to interpret.  We are not speculating or extrapolating.  We are saying clearly that if the customer tells us, based on the reasonable living standards plus 20%, that he or she can still pay and afford his or her mortgage, we believe that if the customer has not, he or she has made a conscious decision not to.  If one has diverted rental income against the borrowings for that property and one is paying zero, that is a conscious decision, and if one has cash deposits in excess of one's arrears, one has also made a conscious decision.  We are not trying to be clever.  We are not trying to incite any discussion.  We are trying to be clear that there are a significant number of people in these arrears situations who may have chosen.  There may be human dimensions to that psychology; we are not arguing that.  As we look at the portfolio, they have made a decision not to prioritise their mortgage payment.  As such, we view that as a decision made consciously and, therefore, a strategic default.<\/p><p> While the debate on arrears is mostly about mortgages, we have spent a vast amount of time on SMEs.  There is not enough debate in that area.  SMEs are a significant driver of the re-basing of this economy and, ultimately, its growth.  We are prioritising SME arrears and have been doing so for 18 months or longer.  At the end of June 2013, close to 90% of SME arrears customers were engaged with the bank and have either a short-term or a longer-term solution in place.  Usually, the short-term solution is put in place to allow a re-basing of their cashflows and to reduce stress while we spend the next period negotiating a longer-term solution with them.<\/p><p> In summary, we believe we are focused on the issue of arrears resolution.  We are meeting and exceeding our targets.  The statistic we will discuss in more detail is that we should have made 20% of offers in the second quarter and we have offered 27%.  We will discuss this in more details presently.  We also are lending.  We are the dominant player in mortgages and the largest lender in SMEs, and I expect the trends to grow and the momentum to continue in 2013 and 2014.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for providing us the opportunity to explain this.  There is much discussion about these topics and a transparent and detailed discussion will help us try to communicate better and will, it is to be hoped, address many of the thoughts and concerns of the committee.<\/p> <p>Only if we are engaged in a discussion that is transparent can there be a mutual understanding that is beneficial to everybody.  We recognise and acknowledge our critical role in economic recovery, which is why we are driving as hard on lending as we are on arrears.  As a new team, we are bringing the bank back from a pretty low position and hope it will be understood we are making as much progress as we reasonably can and contributing to resolving the issues of arrears and lending in the economy, as we should be.  Obviously, we still recognise that the debt owed to the State by AIB cannot be overestimated.  The longer we go on with resolution, the easier it is to forget, but as a team, we do not forget and are reminded daily by the position in which the bank still finds itself as it tries to recover its profitability.  I want to impress on everybody that our team is determined that we will resolve the issue of lending in support of the economy and arrears and, in particular, manage to deliver a profitable and sustainable institution that will be able to start returning taxpayer funds invested in the bailout.  In our minds, no other outcome is permissible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300003#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1378214700,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Duffy.  I will begin by referring to the Central Bank's report of 23 August which indicates that the banks are moving away from short-term, temporary treatments to offering more long-term, sustainable solutions.  In its report the Central Bank gives two sets of figures on pages 4 and 5.  One is a pie chart, while the other is a list of figures.  It states that at the time the number of split mortgages seemed to be 0.4% and that interest-only mortgages still seemed to be 26.8%, which in many cases is very much a deferment process.  It might be a long-term solution in some cases that reduces payments for less interest only accounts for just under 7%, while reductions in payments for greater than interest only accounts account for about another 22%.  The figure for arrears capitalisation is 17.2%, while the figure for term extensions for other people is just under 20%.  The total figure for residential mortgage loan accounts outstanding classified in that amount to arrears is &euro;367 million.  What percentage of that sum is AIB's outstanding figure?  How much does AIB have outstanding on its book at this time?  How does it break down with AIB's terms for resolutions?  How many split mortgages are with AIB?  How many times have people been moved from a purchase to a rental option?  In how many cases has there been a level of write-down of debt?  I am not asking Mr. Duffy to go through the particulars of a given circumstance, but on a case by case basis, is AIB now engaging in debt write-down for people who will not be able to resolve the debt and stay in their homes without a write-down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300006#H00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378214700,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will work back up the list and engage my colleagues in some of the answers.  <\/p><p>  The question around whether AIB is willing to engage in write-downs is a very simple one and the answer is \"Yes\".  If one looks at our disclosed accounts across the corporate, commercial and mortgage book, we have a declared amount of &euro;475 million which has been written down in this process.  What do we mean by this?  All of what we look at is based on affordability.  In a circumstance where an individual, a corporate or somebody in a multi-debt connection can work through the MARP process, everything is dictated from regulatory perspective and it is clear that regardless of the circumstances or any future modelling, there is a lack of affordability and it cannot and will not be paid, however hopeful anybody might be, we try to define an amount that is affordable and the rest becomes a write-off.  In answer to the question, that is how we do it.  That is the quantum that has been addressed in the first six months of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300006#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378214700,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Does that involve somebody not having to go through the insolvency process before AIB will consider that level of debt write-down?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300006#H00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378214700,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

They blend because sometimes the SME has a home connection and other buy-to-let properties.  We are 100% informed by trying to keep people in their homes and jobs intact in viable businesses.<\/p><p>  With regard to the numbers quoted and the statistics, I can give a breakdown of the total level of activity and speak to some of the elements of the individual quantum of offers.  It is somewhat difficult to reconcile the number quoted from the Central Bank.  My colleague, Mr. Brendan Byrne, might be able to confirm that our outstanding arrears number is in the region of &euro;430 million to &euro;450 million.  It is bigger than the aforementioned number but our arrears figure refers to the total of our book not just those in the MARP process.  The quantum of exposure for AIB is between &euro;430 million and &euro;450 million in totality.  As a reference point, that has not materially increased over the past 12 months.<\/p><p>  I will provide a short commentary that can give substance to much of the discussion and questions.  We have three areas.  MARP is in the second quarter of this year.  It is an isolated period of activity informed by a regulatory target for making offers.  I will deal with this issue first before addressing two major areas of activity in which we are also engaged.  In agreement with the regulator, we translated the June target of 20% in our book into 6,200 offers.  We have made 8,600 offers over that period across all of the areas.  Of the figures for the quarter, 153 were split mortgages and 439 were voluntary disposals where customers asked us to take that route.  We had five trade downs, as well as capitalisations of arrears.  People sometimes ask if that is real but a large number of individuals were temporarily in arrears and in such circumstances they have the affordability but we capitalised and extended the arrears provided they paid the nominal sum for six months.  If, for example, somebody is able to pay &euro;300 per month continuously for six months we would then capitalise his or her arrears.  This is a very popular choice among those who are in temporary arrears or a small quantum of arrears.<\/p><p>  We have also offered a number of term extensions.  In some cases, we have resolved the issues through cash payments.  We have been able to take 448 customers out of arrears in the quarter through careful management of cash flows.  We have capital plus interest circumstances in ten cases where the individuals concerned agreed to pay capital plus interest, as well as an additional sum to clear arrears.  We also have a number of legal cases where a significant amount in the first quarter is defined as being in excess of 5,000.  These involved letters sent to individuals advising them that unless they engage with us they will be subject to the full legal route and all of its outcomes.  In the start-up of this process, that was a higher number.  It does not mean that 5,000 people are heading towards repossession.  In our case, that portfolio was, on average, 955 days past due.  In other words, they were nearly three years in arrears and had not engaged with us despite repeated attempts limited to the CCMA.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378215000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>In regard to the three years of arrears, is the figure based on three years in days or three years in terms of the sum of money somebody would accrue after three years in arrears?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00400","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378215000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>It is based on 955 days in arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378215000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>It is days not the sum of money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378215000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>It is the sum that is the equivalent of 955 days of mortgage payments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378215000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Somebody could accumulate those arrears over six years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300007#J00800","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378215000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>That is correct.

The perception is that a sustainable solution is a mortgage issue that can be resolved before the person hits retirement age.  In its resolution processes is there any recognition by AIB that if somebody can meet only the interest on his or her mortgage debt and perhaps a small proportion of the capital, that can be a sustainable solution into the future?  This is particularly relevant now that we are seeing modest house price inflation.  In that situation, with modest inflation, the loan is more or less secured indefinitely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300008#K00200","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378215300,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Yes, this is a difficult one for us because the Central Bank's guidance is that it does not see interest-only payments as a sustainable solution.

However, life is not like that and unexpected financial emergencies arise, for example, a bereavement where a cost to bury someone might arise, a person's car could clap out and need to be replaced at a cost of a couple of thousand euro.  That requires a debt break at some level for a determined period of time.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland is examining this as part of a programme.  How does Mr. Duffy see this being structured?  Let us say I am in a resolution process, my debt commitment is &euro;1,000 per month and that it is costing me &euro;3,000 to replace a car.  I need three months of a debt break, but I do not have the cash up front to buy the car.  How do I get my hands on &euro;3,000 cash as part of a resolution process other than by going to an off-street or some other type of lender?  That damages my credit rating because I cannot get the money because I am out of the market and in a resolution process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300008#K00600","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378215300,"counter":31,"content":"<p>That is a fair question and there are two elements to the answer.

They are assessed on the basis of affordability.  As Mr. Duffy mentioned earlier, we consider somebody's net income and then we adjust it for reasonable living expenses in order to come up with a net disposable income.  Our reasonable living expenses are approximately 20% higher than those of the ISI.  We do not assess in terms of negative equity, it is done purely on the basis of affordability.  We start with the most simple or standard forbearance products.  To the extent that capitalisation, a term extension, etc., might resolve the issue, one never gets to a split mortgage.  We determine that somebody qualifies for a split if he or she does not meet those options in terms of capitalisation or term extension.  One of our criteria relates to whether a customer can afford to pay 80% of the open-market value of the property in a mortgage, regardless of the size of the mortgage he or she currently holds.  If, therefore, somebody has a property on which the debt is &euro;500,000 and which is worth &euro;200,000 on the open market at present, we assess his or her ability to pay a mortgage of &euro;160,000.  That is what we assess it on.<\/p> <p>We do not offer a split mortgage <i>per se<\/i>.  A split mortgage is part of the waterfall where one goes through the other solutions and one sees if it is affordable.  We estimate - at this stage it is only an estimate until the book runs through, based on the information we have from the SFS that customers have given us - that about 10% to 12% of the customers in arrears will ultimately end up on a split.  In AIB&rsquo;s case that would be somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 split mortgages.  That is what we think it is going to end up at, there or thereabouts, based on the information on affordability that we have.<\/p><p> One might assume that a split mortgage offered to someone would be immediately taken up, but in a lot of cases it is not.  At the moment it is around 50:50 between those who take up the offer of a split mortgage and those who do not.  Some people do not wish to carry warehouse debt even though it carries 0% out to retirement.  One of the issues that arises is what happens on retirement for a person who has a mortgage.  We have submitted a new split product to deal with the issue because we learn as we go along in terms of the reaction to the Central Bank.  We have changed our split product.  Instead of reviewing someone&rsquo;s income every three years we have said we would do it every five years.  We have said we would split any uplift in income 50:50 with customers so that if they can get an uplift in income they may keep some of it.  We have said that we will split any out of course money they may get in the form of an inheritance or windfall.  Ultimately, what we have said is that when it reaches retirement, which was probably the main concern for many people, we would look at a person&rsquo;s situation in retirement and affordability based on the criteria we would use to give a new mortgage rather than the affordability to pay down existing debt.  We said we would be prepared to give people with a split mortgage a lifetime interest in the property and our recovery would come ultimately from the sale of the property or the estate.  That would give people the certainty that when they reached retirement age they could stay in their home.  We have submitted that option and we are awaiting approval from the Central Bank.  I do not envisage any issue with getting approval from the Central Bank but a period of time is required before the option goes through.  That may make a split mortgage more attractive.  As it stands, not every offer of a split mortgage that we make is taken up, even though intuitively one would think it would be the case that it would be accepted.  Less than half of such offers are accepted at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300013#P00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1378218600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I have just a couple of points to make.

On the figures, I am a little frustrated.  I said to Deputy McGrath earlier that the presentation was very detailed, but the subject of this meeting is not in the information the delegates are giving us.  There have been numerous speakers, but what we are looking for concerns the last quarter.  There was a regulatory requirement on AIB to offer long-term sustainable solutions by the end of June this year.  We are now into the fifth speaker and we still do not have a full breakdown of the offers it has made.  What we have been able to assess so far is that 8,600 offers of long-term solutions have been made.  Some 5,000 of these - I presume the figure of 5,000 is accurate; it seems to be a round figure - involve repossession letters.  The rest that have been announced so far make up 2,100, which leaves a hole of 1,500.  None of us at this committee, one hour into the meeting, has a clue as to the type of offers that have been made.

This should add up to 8,600 and, for the Chair's purposes, we will provide that reconciliation as a matter of record in order that the joint committee has it to avoid confusion.  Let me be clear again: this characterisation as repossession in those cases is materially incorrect.  As I explained, 955 days of refusing to contact at any level is three years with no contact or engagement.  One is forced into the process by the regulatory situation.  As I said, we have seen exactly what we expected with regard to all of the early letters that went out, namely, a practical level of engagement and other sustainable solutions being put in place.

I put it to him that under the regulatory regime announced and imposed on his bank, it must be a long-term solution.  However, a letter to a customer asking him or her to engage is not a long-term solution.  Unfortunately, a letter stating the bank will repossess a house is a long-term solution, regardless of whether members in opposition agree with it.  Either the bank is offering the customer a long-term solution or it is stating it intends to repossess, but it cannot issue 5,894 letters to customers and then claim it has reached the Central Bank's targets.  While the Central Bank has not verified the figures AIB has presented today, it will not or should not verify them unless long-term solutions were offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300016#S00300","speaker":"959"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378219800,"counter":129,"content":"<p>Let us be clear again on that issue.

As stated previously, there is a bad answer for everyone.  In the event that the person does not engage and has the previous three years' record of behaviour, it will become a repossession.

The bank has not exceeded the targets.  It has not even reached or come halfway close to the targets.  I put it to Mr. Duffy that after waiting this length of time, AIB has failed dramatically tens of thousands of customers who are in mortgage arrears in coming up with long-term sustainable solutions and that this window-dressing concerning the legal letters pertains to trying to reach targets.  What members expected but hoped would not materialise was that if targets were set, the banks would reach them.  The head of the Central Bank stated precisely the same thing to the finance committee.  His concern was that if targets were set for the banks, they would reach them.  I believe this is an absolutely blatant and appalling way and it is disgraceful that AIB has issued 6,000 letters and is trying to pretend this constitutes reaching the targets in some way, shape or form.

He is patently ignoring the fact, for statements like this, that there are an additional 4,000 customers who were taken out of arrears outside this quarter.

We have done 12,500 in our total, of which 8,600 is what the Deputy was looking at, and we went through another 4,455 solutions for him where we explained what was involved.  Therefore, I would put to the Deputy quite the opposite.  There is a target.  There is a definition of those targets.  We are meeting those targets.  In addition, just because the regulator did not have a target in the first quarter does not mean we should ignore the fact that 14,000 customers have had a great deal of assurance about their circumstance and 4,500 other solutions have been put in place.  I respect what the Deputy states in terms of the quarter but I would argue that was a natural consequence of the regulatory target.  It is not going to be the majority of cases.  It represents 40% of the reality of what we have done this year.  In terms of the customer out there, I would like customers to understand that the great majority of this - 60% of this plus - involves good solutions for the customer and as we roll forward, we will not have to deal with 5,000 legacy cases that have not paid for three years.  There is a more balanced and broader picture which, to be fair to the customer out there, ought to be articulated, but I am happy to engage further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300017#T00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378220400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>The focus here is on the quarter.

Would Mr. Duffy explain that again?  It does not make sense.  There is a significant appetite and much support for split mortgages.  There is serious concern about what happens to the residual debt on retirement age and that such should not be pursued, but customers want to see offers of a split mortgage.

The sustainable developers have been allowed to go into NAMA and, in many cases, have managed to trade their way to a profitable position once again.  However, the individuals are being told they will remain on the line for an eternity.  It is a completely unfair way to treat people and the current directors of AIB are beholden to address this issue.  The previous Government put NAMA in place and allowed the developers to trade themselves out of it in a very favourable fashion by putting the taxpayers and people of the State on the line, but we are not able to develop a system which doles out sustainability and affordability to the people of my generation who have been hamstrung and mentally and financially pressurised.  I cannot believe there is one treatment for developers and another for the mortgage holders of this country.<\/p><p>  Insufficient education is being provided.  The delegates include people from the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  I am dealing with people in my clinics as a politician and a former banker.  They are asking me for assistance in resolving their own issues.  There is no knowledge among customers of what is acceptable from the banks.<\/p> <p>Every individual I deal with has a different skills set and meets a different response from the banks.  That is unfair.  When one asks an individual to go to a bank and take out a loan, the loan is given by an institution licensed by the State because we respect its capacity to do right by the citizens and the State.  In this case I welcome that next Monday the personal insolvency legislation will be enacted.  Despite what some of the journalists said today, that it is a humiliation to go down the personal insolvency route, it is the greatest form of liberation my generation will see.  The first thing we need to do is walk in, throw the keys on the table and say: \"Okay, you have a problem; you need to solve it for me.\"  That is the first bit of advice I will give anyone who walks into my office.  The bank has a generation of people in negative equity in unaffordable, unsustainable loans, because they are there for 25, 35 and, in some cases, 40 years.  In 2006, the average mortgage was 37.5 years.<\/p><p> It is imperative for the economy and the welfare of this generation that the bank starts educating people.  The idea that the bank and customer keep their agreement private is also inappropriate.  If the developer gets one type of treatment and a write-off, will the bank explain that to people?  I welcome what Mr. Duffy described as a fair level of write-down or affordability, with an index plus 20%.  I know educated, hard-working people for whom the majority of their disposable or net income is going to paying off banks.  They do not have a clue about these matters.  It is not my fault or that of the banks but of society, and the level of communication is inappropriate.  This is a form of liberation and the bank will have to play ball with it.  The State has identified &euro;9 billion in the stress tests for write-down by the banks.  What will AIB do to educate its customers and ensure the level of personal insolvency trustees is of a sufficient standard to ensure everyone gets the same level of representation or as close to it as possible?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300019#V02100","speaker":"1048","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378222200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. Brendan O'Connor to comment, but I take all of that on board.

I am putting this point of clarity to this meeting and also because I am sure the communications units of the other banks are probably watching these proceedings.  I am anxious to convey a clear message.  When we arranged this series of meetings it was with the intention of the 20% target being reached at the end of June and looking at it in September.  At the outset of the deliberations today I spoke specifically about that point, and other members have done so too.  The communication that went to the different financial institutions due to appear before the committee this week stated, under my instruction, that the committee wished to carry out a review with the covered institutions with specific consideration being given to how the various banks are dealing with a series of issues, one of which is mortgage arrears and the target that by the end of June 2013 banks should have proposed sustainable mortgage solutions for 20% of their distressed borrowers.  That 20% can be 20% that was arrived at for the last four or five years up to the end of June or it can be 20% of the distressed mortgage book that was worked on during the first two quarters of this year.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that these banks were instructed to meet the 20% target by 30 June this year.  If Mr. Duffy does not have it to hand this afternoon, I am asking him for it as soon as possible because the committee will also be inviting the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank to appear before it in the next couple of weeks as part of this module.  We want to see where AIB is with its 20% in specific numbers and terms, that is, how many people, how many solutions for people and so forth.  My message to the other banks that are watching the proceedings this afternoon is that when their representatives appear before the committee tomorrow and on Thursday, we will be expecting to get the same information from them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300022#Y00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378223400,"counter":204,"content":"<p>That is absolutely noted, Chairman.

The communications unit is reporting to me that there is a good deal of telecommunications interference in the room and that many speakers who are talking are not being picked up because their mobile telephones, laptops or iPads are creating distortions in the room.  I remind members to have them switched off.  Many people are watching us this evening and what is being discussed is of great importance.  It would be an awful tragedy if much of that commentary was lost because a mobile telephone was turned on.  I echo the same statement to the people in the public gallery because the same interference is coming from the public gallery.  I remind everyone to have their telephones turned to flight mode or turned off completely.<\/p><p>  I wish to clarify something dealt with during the first round of questions.  The approach to the split mortgage seems to be at variance between different financial institutions.  Under the AIB modelling Mr. Duffy referred to a split mortgage that allows a payment that is greater than the insolvency payment.  The couple in question have approximately &euro;200 per month more than they would have if they went into an insolvency arrangement.  That arrangement has them paying back approximately &euro;770 or &euro;780 per month for the next 35 years, which brings them up to retirement age.  It means that the sum paid in repayments on the split mortgage is in excess of the outstanding sum before the split minus interest.  There are two questions people need to know.  What happens the &euro;96,000 when somebody hits retirement?  In that case approximately &euro;100,000 is split.  The person becomes activated again on the year of retirement.  What actually happens with that?<\/p><p>  The other question relates to a common practice.  As part of the resolution process on a split mortgage, is the household income inclusive of mortgage protection and house insurance?  I assume that is the case but I seek confirmation.  Having examined the figures it seems if people took the insolvency route the finances would be a little tighter by &euro;200 per week but after six years they would be out of the process, whereas the AIB model would have them tied in for nearly 35 years.  The insolvency option looks far more attractive than the AIB split mortgage option based on the modelling provided today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300026#CC00300","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378225500,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I will talk to the model case study we have given the committee.  Under our split mortgage solution, on retirement we would assess the affordability of the person to see what he or she could pay.  We would guarantee to give someone a lifetime interest in the house and, at that stage, that which cannot be paid would go on a further moratorium or split.  It would be rolled up and we would recover it from the estate.  It would roll up.  We have stated that under our new model we would not go after anything more than the collateral value of the house.  By definition there would be no residual debt on that.  That is what practically happens in retirement.<\/p><p>  Our reasonable living expenses guidelines are approximately 20% in excess of those of the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  We do not get into the business and never want to get into the business of determining what people spend their money on.  We have put on a premium to allow for that.  We also add a premium in cases where people have child care.  We will do it for certain medical expenses where there are particular recurring medical expenses, but we do not get into going down through people's expenditure in line-item detail.  We have no wish to be the judge and jury of what people spend their money on.  We have an absolute level that is based on the ISI model plus 20%.<\/p><p>  The Chairman's last observation was whether they would be better in personal insolvency and perhaps the answer is they might be.<\/p> <p>I suspect that if this runs through the ISI guidelines - where the reasonable living expenses will be lower - there will be more money available to pay the mortgage because the net disposable income will be higher and potentially some of their unsecured debt will be written down.  We will write down unsecured debt as part of our own process.  Where a customer has unsecured debt with AIB and where we are putting in place a solution, we will consider that also.  I do not know the specifics in terms of their debt outside of this.  However, I would think that, with insolvency and with this situation, they would not qualify for personal insolvency.  They would still have the mortgage with personal insolvency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300026#CC00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1378226100,"counter":261,"content":"<p>To take Mr. O'Connor's example - he wrote the specifics into the bank's modelling - let us consider circumstances where there is no unsecured debt outside of the specifics, where there are no outstanding debts with any other creditor, for example, a credit union, a credit card company or a different bank in respect of a car loan, and where the only entity with which the couple involved is engaging in arriving at a resolution is AIB.  If such a couple approached me, I would state they would be obliged to choose an option.  Either they could make structured repayments over 35 years - albeit with some level of change involved - or endure six years of hardship after which they would be out the gap.  It has been suggested that where this has happened, customers have been caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.  If a client is offered a split mortgage or some other solution and if he or she chooses to apply for a personal insolvency arrangement and endure six years of hardship rather than entering a structured programme that would take him or her up to retirement age, would the bank - as it is capable of doing - veto such an arrangement?

I am grateful that this matter has been clarified.  The position in this regard is disappointing.  We will look forward to our next meeting with the bank in order to discover whether it is changing.  Many solutions have been offered but very few have actually been put in place.  That certainly tallies with what I have heard during regular meetings with the people involved.  There is much talk and many offers but not a great deal is happening.<\/p><p>  The notion of debt for equity was first raised in this very room in 2009 by the then chief executive of the EBS, Mr. Fergus Murphy.  Mr. Murphy submitted a paper to the then Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs which was compiling a report on the issue of mortgage arrears.  Debt for equity was suggested as a possible solution at that point and probably before then.  However, there was always the difficulty of getting it onto the banks' balance sheets.  Has AIB done any work in trying to offer debt for equity as a proper sustainable solution?  It would probably be a better solution than that which involves split mortgages.  Mr. Murphy was very helpful to the then Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs in 2009 and I would certainly recommend him to AIB in the context of the knowledge he possesses of these issues.<\/p><p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government stated earlier today that he had been unable to become involved in the issue relating to Priory Hall as a result of ongoing court proceedings.  Did these proceedings have any bearing on AIB's decision to opt out?  Was the bank wary of taking any positive action in the light of the ongoing court proceedings?<\/p> <p>Could AIB offer a commitment not to repossess family homes?  It was said that it is the bank's policy to keep people in their homes and that it wants to help people, but will the bank give a commitment that people will be kept in their family homes?<\/p><p> Interest rates are not the focus of the discussion today, but information on them was provided as part of the submission to the committee.  Page 6 of the presentation to the committee concerns me greatly.  It shows in graphic detail an uncompetitive market.  What would one say to me if I were to send the document to the Competition Authority or the competition section of the European Commission?  Does an issue arise in terms of competition law, given that market rates are coalescing?  The market average, including AIB's rate, is 4.53%.  As AIB has grown bigger and achieved a dominant position in the mortgage market of 46%, one could ask if it is using the dominant position in conjunction with another dominant entity of which we know to keep the interest rates at an unnatural high.  The question is whether anti-competitive practices are going on in the banking market.  The figures are very interesting.  There is a common average and a commonality in increasing the standard variable rate while the European Central Bank rate goes down.  There is a similar interest rate in the United Kingdom at central bank level, yet the standard variable rate averages out at 0.5% below Irish standard variable rates.  My question is whether there is a competition issue and if I should send page 6 to the Competition Authority or the European Commission.<\/p><p> Two other issues arise.  Has any progress been made on the Mercer report in terms of cutting costs in the bank?  There are many people who are paying their mortgage but are struggling.  They are in full compliance and do not appear on any lists of borrowers in trouble but many of them are deeply in trouble because they are putting off going to doctors and they are not putting food on the table.  They might be in trouble with other loans but are paying their mortgage because they are proud of their home and they want to do that.  They might be working.  They might be in very good jobs with very high mortgages.  What is on offer for those people who are not in arrears and who might not be likely to go into arrears soon but whose mortgage is a daily struggle?  Will they be offered a split mortgage or a debt-for-equity arrangement to ease the burden on them and, ultimately, to prevent arrears?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300027#DD00600","speaker":"1116","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378226700,"counter":267,"content":"<p>I will ask Mr. O'Connor to cover the questions on debt-for-equity arrangements and early arrears and I will answer the other questions in reverse order for convenience.<\/p><p>  On the Mercer report, we have written to the Minister outlining that the solutions we took and put in place are going to meet the 10% reduction target.

This reflects the frustration members are encountering and I am sure the witnesses are picking up on that frustration at this meeting.  Members have heard repeatedly that everything is moving too slowly.  In the conversation on this issue in recent years, people have heard about moral hazard and moving on from that, that people will strategically default on their mortgages and that this is one reason the banks are moving so slowly.  I believe this is one reason so many people are not engaging with the banks.  They do not believe banks are particularly helpful, and while this does not apply to Mr. Duffy, the bolshie performance of some chief executive officers of other banks when appearing before the joint committee adds to the perception that the banks have no interest in helping out mortgage holders who are in distress.<\/p><p>  Mr. Duffy mentioned a figure today of write-downs by his bank thus far of &euro;38 million, but I note one bankrupt developer owes his wife more than that.  We are not moving on this issue and given the joint committee has been talking about this issue for two or three years, I would have expected that when all the chief executive officers appeared before it, the cumulative figure under discussion would be close to &euro;1 billion.  However, it is nowhere near that.  When one considers the actual total number of distressed mortgages and the amount people owe, one really should be talking about the writing off by AIB and the other banks of hundreds of millions of euro or at least &euro;1 billion by this point and the banks should be indicating that a certain additional amount was in the pipeline.  However, when such small figures are being cited, it is frustrating for members and the perception among the public is the banks have no interest in doing anything about this crisis.  Instead, they intend to drag it on and ascertain whether they can work their way through it.  From a political perspective, Mr. Duffy is in a more difficult position, in that AIB's shareholders are also the taxpayers.  As its customers are the same taxpayers, therefore they will lose either way.  If the bank gives out too much, they will lose and if the bank does not give out enough, they also will be the ones who will pay.<\/p><p>  Consequently, there is a need for the banks to move quickly on the cases with which they are dealing.  Last year, I believe Mr. Duffy stated there was a structural problem in this regard and that AIB did not have sufficient staff members who were trained to deal with these matters quickly enough.  Twelve months later, it appears as though the same problem persists with his bank and the other banks.  I believe there is a need to move on this issue quickly because this is what is adding to the poor public perception of banks, namely, their level of respect for their customers, in particular those who are in distress.  I seek to ascertain Mr. Duffy's thoughts on this subject and on the future direction in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300030#GG00700","speaker":"1095"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378227900,"counter":310,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Twomey, there are a few issues.  First, one year ago we did not have the capability but we do now.  It is a team that is much stronger, better trained and, one hopes, much better at delivery of solutions.  To that point, the 14,000 who fell into arrears this year, who have been managed well and who have moved out of arrears reflect an indication of that capacity and we are trying to move at volume and support issues.  We could have had a much higher arrears number were we not good at taking people out of early arrears situations.  That is the first point.<\/p><p>  The second point to which I would draw the Deputy's attention is the mortgage number may be small.  In addition to our own capacity and ability, we were in a position in which there was a significant impediment to communication.  The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, really was very difficult, as was the ruling by Miss Justice Dunne.  That said, one might ask what could be done if one did not operate in that world.  The number in our accounts is &euro;475 million and other than &euro;38 million, the majority of that went to corporates and commercials.  This is because in that space, we are under no such impediment.  We can go ahead and negotiate and execute a deal and have done so.  As I stated, 90% of the population is in an early or a longer-term structured deal.  Consequently, in the corporate and SME sector, where we are dealing with that world and are not under any of these artificial constraints, we have been much more effective at execution.  Consequently, I ask the Deputy, what is a motivation?  People talk about whether a bank should or could or does not wish to do this but it is very simple.  If the taxpayer is to get money back from AIB, the bank must prove it can solve these situations and has adequate capital.<\/p> <p>If we do not do that soon, that will be a massive dilution of the value back to the taxpayer.  Therefore, we are motivated to do it, in the exact same way as lending.  If we do not lend, we will not have a revenue pool that can sustain the bank and generate capital for the future.  We absolutely have to deliver on this.  All I am saying to the committee today is that we are maybe not satisfying the committee by providing enough detail upfront and speaking about one quarter, but I honestly believe that the institution and all of its resources have done far more than that.  Perhaps it is our fault that we are not getting that across, and that as the committee looks at the next 12 months and six months, we will get significant volumes of this work completed.  That will lead, I would estimate, to a much higher number of write-offs as we go through this process because it is a commitment that we have made that where it is unaffordable, we will write it off.  I would hope that we are not judged too severely in a short window and that we will demonstrate by our actions that there is a significant amount of progress happening in this space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300030#GG00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1378228500,"counter":312,"content":"<p>That is the point that must get out there - Mr. Duffy must get it out there and we will try to get it out there - because there is no engagement because customers simply feel that there is nothing happening.

Before we get into the mortgage crisis figures which is the purpose of the meeting, I want to recognise that there has been significant progress in AIB.  Some of the figures Mr. Duffy presented on loan-to-debt ratios and operating costs of the bank are all moving in the right direction.  While there are various matters with which I will take issue here, at a macro level Mr. Duffy and his management team seem to be turning the bank around and that must be recognised.  I recognise that.<\/p><p>  The focus of today's meeting is the arrears targets.  As the Chairman stated earlier, it was to look at how the banks are doing versus the targets that have been set by the Government.  I believe the targets are a genuine attempt by the Government to solve the mortgage crisis.  I happen to believe that the targets try to solve the wrong issue.  The symptom is arrears.  The problem is not arrears.  The problem is that Irish households have too much debt relative to their incomes.  I have stated consistently that targeting arrears as solving the mortgage crisis will not work.  First, it is trying to solve the wrong problem.  Second, I was not convinced that the banks would engage in it in the spirit that, I believe, the Government and the Central Bank wanted, which was long-term sustainable solutions.<\/p><p>  I want to go back over the figures that have been presented.  I take Mr. Duffy's point that this is a single quarter and, as he stated to Deputy Pearse Doherty, maybe this is an unusual quarter, but the purpose of this meeting was to see how the banks have been doing in Q2 against the Government targets.  If we go through them, 8,600 offers have been made.  Of those, 5,900 are legal letters seeking engagement.  While I accept that those letters have to be written, I do not think anyone would seriously suggest that a letter stating the customer must engage with the bank counts as an offer of a long-term restructuring of the customer's mortgage and I imagine that when the Central Bank audit is done, the Central Bank will conclude the same.  I appreciate those letters have to be written but I see no justification for suggesting that any of those letters are, in fact, an offer of a long-term sustainable restructuring to a mortgage.  Therefore, I would take those 5,900 out.<\/p> <p>A further 1,000 are cashflow help and mortgage deemed affordable.  In other words, there was no restructuring.  Either the bank helped them find extra money to pay it or it determined that they had the money to pay this, were choosing not to do so and needed to start paying it.  A further 1,100 are capitalisation of arrears and term extensions, both of which increase the profits to the bank and increase the payments from the lender.  They are not a long-term restructuring.  They are saying \"You, borrower, have &euro;2,000 in arrears.  We deem you able to pay that if we roll it into the &euro;150,000 you owe.  Therefore, that is the long-term restructuring.\"  Perhaps that is the case in some cases but based on the anecdotal evidence I am seeing on the ground, in many cases, those kinds of offers are not really long-term restructuring of unsustainable debt.  It is worth noting that both the capitalisation of arrears and term extensions lead to increased payments over the lifetime of the loan from the borrower.  <\/p><p> That leaves us with just 600 offers which are split between the voluntary surrender.  I was delighted to hear Mr. Duffy say that in the case of voluntary surrender, AIB is taking the hit.  My understanding is that if a borrower owes &euro;200,000, the house is sold for &euro;100,000 and it does not look like the couple could pay any more, AIB is saying that they no longer owe it the remaining &euro;100,000 and that it is making a provision in its books, will never come back after them for that money and is legally surrendering the money.  I am delighted to hear that.  <\/p><p> We then have about 143 split mortgages.  We can disagree on this but as I see it, the long-term sustainable offers that have been made do not number 8,600 but 600.  We can argue the toss on the cashflow help and the capitalisation of arrears but what is unambiguous is the nearly 6,000 which are legal letters.  I would much prefer AIB to have come here today and say that it has not hit the targets and is doing its best to hit them but is not going to pretend that the 6,000 legal letters are long-term sustainable offers.  That would have been a preferable position for AIB to have taken today.  <\/p><p> Voluntary surrender is good.  The delegation might confirm to me that my understanding is correct but I am delighted to hear that the bank lets the couple or borrower walk away from the difference, which leaves us with the split mortgage.  Mr. O'Connor said that the split mortgage is less attractive than one may think.  Of course, it is.  Ultimately, the split mortgage does not work for the economy.  Mr. Duffy said that one of the core strategies of AIB is to return economic growth to the country.  Here is why it does not work.  The marginal tax rate is 52%.  Let us talk about a couple with a split mortgage.  Again, I recognise the 0% being charged on the shelved portion, which is very welcome and very different to what Bank of Ireland is doing, which is a disgrace.  I recognise that 0%.  I thought it was 1% and am delighted to see it is 0%.  Here is the problem.  I calculate that there are about 650,000 men, women and children in Ireland living in houses - residential, owner-occupied or buy-to-let - in arrears or restructured not in arrears.  It is a huge problem and, as we know, it is rising.  The marginal tax rate is 52% so there is 48% of any additional income left.  Let us say Mr. O'Connor gets a split mortgage and his partner may be out of work to raise kids.  One of the parents may be out of work and decides to return to work, retrain, work overtime or get a master's degree and get a new job.  They decide that they or the couple are going to better themselves.  Here is what the split mortgage does.  It says that the Government will take 52% of any additional income coming into the household for the rest of their lives.  Of the 48% left, AIB will take 24% so they are left with 24%.  It is an effective tax rate of 76% and I have yet to find an economist on Earth who would say that a 76% marginal tax rate is not a massive dampener on economic activity.  That is my concern and one of the reasons people are not taking up the split mortgage.  <\/p><p> The other problem is that AIB has set the baseline for a reasonable standard of living not against what a person earns but against what the insolvency service has said, plus 20%.<\/p> <p>That 20% is good but let us be clear that the service's guidelines allow for a punitive level of living during bankruptcy.  It took the Vincentian approach, which was minimalist to begin with, and took things like holidays out of it.  One cannot have a holiday.  One raises one's children until they leave the house.  According to the guidelines one will never be able to bring one's children on holiday or take a holiday oneself.  They were always meant as a short-term punitive standard of living.  Unfortunately, what is deemed sustainable by AIB and the other banks is to say it does not matter if a household is on two average industrial wages, which would amount to approximately &euro;70,000 or if it comprises two doctors earning &euro;200,000.  Everyone is going to this highly punitive standard of living plus 20% and if somebody earns more than that over his or her lifetime, he or she will be allowed 24% of the amount.  If that is the best we can come up with, an entire generation of Irish people who should be bettering their financial circumstances and creating jobs and entrepreneurship will be stuck in a debt trap.<\/p><p> After a long preamble, I will now ask the following question.  The Blackrock stress test made &euro;2.5 billion of public money available to AIB to deal with residential mortgages.  I understand that the write-downs to date comprise approximately &euro;100 million, which is approximately 4% of the aforementioned figure.  On the basis that Irish people have made &euro;2.5 billion available to deal with residential mortgages, why is only &euro;100 million being used to write down mortgages in distress?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300031#HH00700","speaker":"1107","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378229400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I understand the analogy around the 76% effective tax rate.  We try to keep people in their homes.  That is the principle of the MARP targets.  If people can afford to stay in their home, we ask whether there is an affordability level at which they can remain.  To do that we have to examine their net income and we need a consistent and reasonable living standard to work from because we do not have the ability to make a call in every circumstance.  I take the Deputy's point.<\/p><p>  On capitalisations and term extensions, they are sustainable solutions.  I do not take the Deputy's point in that regard to the extent that we model them over the life of the mortgage and the mortgage is sustainable to its original term or a term extension of a number of years.  The mortgage itself is sustainable and the capital and interest will be paid down to zero over its lifetime.<\/p><p>  On the legal cases that we put in, we are not required to offer sustainable restructuring to everybody under MARP.

I will come to Priory Hall later, but my main question is on variable interest rates versus tracker mortgages.  Last April-May the ECB reduced its interest rates, but this was not passed on to customers with variable interest rate mortgages.  Then there was a 0.4% increase for AIB customers with variable rate mortgages and a 0.25% increase for those in EBS.  I said in the D&aacute;il at the time that there seemed to be a syndication between what the ECB did and what AIB did with its variable interest rate mortgages.  The point has already been made that outside the distressed loans category there are quite a number of mortgage holders who are feeding their mortgages possibly before they are feeding their children.  They are struggling to pay their mortgages and succeeding, but an interest rate increase could tip them over the edge and then the bank will have to deal with that issue.  Every time this happens there is a conversation about passing on interest rate cuts to variable rate customers and it does not happen.  The last time there was an increase.  It has been suggested to me that the accumulated wisdom among the delegates is that a 5.5% interest rate for variable rate mortgage holders is the most sustainable for the bank to continue in the future and that the current rate is unsustainable.  I would like to get AIB's response to this.  Is what has been suggested to me wrong?<\/p> <p>Does Mr. Duffy believe rates can remain at the current level?  What does he foresee happening in the future in regard to variable interest rate mortgages and how does he react to the charge that AIB is forcing variable interest rate mortgage holders to pay for tracker mortgage holders remaining as they are?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300034#LL01100","speaker":"1018","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378230000,"counter":339,"content":"<p>Mr. Bernard Byrne who has been working on this will comment later.

That is not an issue of correlation.  What it comes down to is the cost of funding the bank, namely, what it costs to fund to lend and the marginal rates of recovery on that.  That is what drives much of this.  Mr. Byrne will comment on the specifics of the rates.  I will then come back and respond to the Deputy's final comment on rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300035#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378230000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>The cost of funding the mortgage book is based on the funding cost for the bank.  For a long time now, the ECB has not been a funding cost for the bank.  The predominant cost of funding for the bank has been the deposit cost to it and what it has been doing in the wholesale marketplace in terms of ancillary funding in that regard.  The ECB has been a decreasing portion of the bank's funding.  The ECB funding was always associated with the proportion of our distressed book which it was funding as we were trying to deleverage that programme.  The ECB provides the bank with funding to fund its deleveraging of assets.  As those assets are sold the ECB is paid off.  That is the logic.  The ECB as a movement in the marketplace, which has decreased to a low rate, is not the basis on which the bank can fund itself today, tomorrow or in the next few weeks.  The deposit base of the bank is funding it.  That is our core funding cost.  Incrementally on top of that we have the cost of our wholesale funding transactions, which are more expensive.  On top of this is the added operational costs associated with running a mortgage book plus a margin.<\/p><p>  When we last appeared before the committee ten months ago we talked about where rates were going and their probably reaching levels of below 5% and that that may not be where it stops.  We have no intention at this point of increasing rates.  However, I cannot guarantee in terms of where funding costs go that the rates being spoken about will not reappear.  Looking at the UK and European marketplace rates at various points in time, it is evident that long term rates do move between 4.5% to 5.5% or 6% with very low base rates.  Obviously, if base rates go above that and funding costs in general rise different things happen.  The current rates are where we are trying to get to in terms of establishing a viable bank that can generate profitability from the loan book, which is the standard variable rate book, with no cross-subsidisation factored in, considered or thought about in relation to the tracker book.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300035#MM00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1378230000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Has Mr. Byrne calculated within that the damage an interest rate increase of that nature would do to impaired loans or distressed mortgages?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300035#MM00400","speaker":"1018"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378230000,"counter":342,"content":"<p>Yes.  This is a difficult issue.  The point the Deputy makes is a valid one.  Under regulatory obligation, each time AIB increases interest rates it must consider the impact of that increase on its book.  We have a regulatory obligation to do that.  Another thing we have to do is get to the point where we generate our own capital.  If as a bank we do not generate our own capital by making profits then every year we will need more capital from somebody to fund the bank.  We have a dual obligation.  We need a mortgage book that is profitable and generates sufficient return to generate capital for the bank.  That is what we are trying to do.  The standard variable rate pricing has been picked.  It is based on a bottom up calculation of our funding cost, operating costs plus a margin to get us to the point where we can generate profitability out of the standard variable rate book as a stand-alone book rather than by way of cross-subsidisation between trackers.  There is no cross-subsidisation and no calculation of cross-subsidisation between our tracker book and standard variable rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300035#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Byrne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378230000,"counter":343,"content":"<p>We do not propose to increase rates by a percentage.

That will happen only if the cost of funding changes.  As things stand, we are comfortable with our cost of funding and where mortgages stand.  There is no 5.5% or perceived wisdom of a number.

I will take up Deputy Pearse Doherty's point.  The &euro;100,000 a year people seem to have been very well protected.  The 16% reduction in staff costs was accomplished by a 15.3% reduction in staff numbers.  The problem of high pay, to which Deputy Pearse Doherty referred, was not addressed during the year.  Page 9 of the presentation shows total impaired loans in the owner-occupier sector are up by &euro;1 billion, or 25%.  It might have moderated in the past few months, as 60% of the increase took place in the previous six months, but having &euro;1 billion added over the year does not indicate much progress.<\/p><p>  There has been a sharp deterioration in the in buy-to-let sector and three quarters of it occurred this year.  It has caused concern in the Seanad that, when buy-to-let people get into difficulty, the solution of the bank is to seek vacant possession in order that those who have paid rent to the landlords face eviction.  We have asked the Ministers for Justice and Equality and the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputies Alan Shatter and Phil Hogan, to examine the issue.  I would like the bank to confirm that it is not its policy that where the landlord goes bankrupt, the tenant, for whom it is the principal private residence, faces eviction and that it does not insist on vacant possession in these cases.  I note with concern that this problem is rising rapidly.<\/p><p>  The case studies presented indicate a banking system that was completely irresponsible in its lending.  The case mentioned on page 18 refers to someone with an income of &euro;46,000 and debt of &euro;356,000.  Are people who engaged in that lending still in the bank?  The case mentioned on page 16 involves someone with an income of &euro;38,000 and debt of &euro;331,000.  Who was in charge of the ship when it was steering so steadily towards the rocks with this irresponsible lending?  That is what the case studies indicate to me.  When the Oireachtas gets around to the investigation, I hope the people who lent recklessly will be brought to book.  I hope they are all gone from the bank because that explains the situation in which we find ourselves.<\/p><p>  The final concern is that, in the era of massive lending, the banking system became fixated on property.  In the period 1998 to 2008 under 2% of the increase in lending by Irish banks was in manufacturing and agriculture.  The banks went on a property splurge that the two Houses are trying to deal with.  Have we any indication that the banking industry will ever know anything about industry and SMEs or is this the local auctioneer, bank manager and property solicitor taking a slight break and hoping the property market starts off again?  The Central Bank will have to control the voracious property lending that got the country into so much trouble in the decade before the system blew up in 2008.  Do we have people who know anything about entrepreneurship, SMEs or what Irish industry is doing?  Most people outside see AIB as purely a property bank, with the others.  That is what wrecked the country.  AIB did not have anything else in which people were invited to invest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300038#PP00200","speaker":"1157"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378231800,"counter":368,"content":"<p>Which questions should I tackle?

We have been trying to address both and, as we continue to work, members will see the benefits of it.<\/p> <p>Perhaps then the committee might have a more positive view of what we are achieving.  I will come back to the reference on page 9 to buy-to-let properties and the absolute levels.<\/p><p> With regard to the case studies, the representation of irresponsible lending and the question of whether the people are still in the bank, all I can tell the committee is that AIB is represented by a new board and a new executive.  A very significant number of senior people in the bank who were there are gone through early retirement and all kinds of mechanisms.  I now know as matter of fact who did what and whether they are all gone because I was not here.  More important is the policy we have in place on lending and the skills sets we should have.  It is one which I am confident will lead to prudent risk-taking and appropriate investment in the right sectors of growth in the economy.  I firmly believe that is the case and the team is experienced enough and has been through many of these ups and downs before.  They understand what sensible risk-taking is and the appropriate sectoral skills we require to do that.  We have invested heavily in them and are investing heavily in the sectoral reports on the economy.  We are putting together the whole package of education, skills and risk-taking.  I hope we will be able to demonstrate that we are doing a sensible job in terms of investing in the economy.  However, I cannot give more assurance around the individual specifics in the names of people in the company.  No one will be allowed to engage in the kind of lending to which the committee referred given the construct we have.<\/p><p> A question was asked about the absolute level of increase in arrears.

His answers have been blunt and to the point, which is very much appreciated.  One of the things that has struck me and that will strike many taxpayers coming from this meeting is what Mr. Duffy has put on the public record, that is, 50% of people in arrears are refusing or failing to fill in financial statements.  Taxpayers throughout the country will welcome the fact that AIB is making efforts to make the people concerned engage in the process.  How long is a bank meant to wait before a person engages?  Is it four years, five years or six years?<\/p> <p>If the banks fail to engage, they do not help anybody.  I would like to echo some of the comments made by my colleagues throughout this meeting by asking Mr. Duffy to consider why they are not engaging.  I meet a significant number of people in my office who are really fearful and intimidated.  I believe Mr. Duffy when he says his bank has a new approach, a new team, a new structure and a new attitude to its dealings.  These people do not get that, however.  Perhaps they do not know it.  I welcome the sending of the legal letter.  It has to be sent because the issue has to be dealt with.  I am interested in what the bank does after that.  I refer to how it gets its message out, for example.<\/p><p> Mr. Duffy mentioned that representatives of the bank are going to travel to Waterford to meet customers there.  All of that sounds very positive, but it is not what I experience in my constituency office when I meet grown men who have always wanted to provide for their families and been able to do so, but simply cannot pay their mortgages at present.  When they receive a letter from the bank, they consider it as a threat to take their home.  That is the fear that exists.  I would like Mr. Duffy to take that message from me when he leaves this meeting.  In many cases - there may be exceptions - these people are genuinely fearful of engaging with the banks.  They are intimidated.  They do not know how to sit down and pen a letter to a bank.  I think that is the biggest issue we have to overcome collectively.  Obviously, we have a job to do in that regard.<\/p><p> I would like to ask a couple of questions.  I am happy to group them together.  Fitch and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's have suggested that Bank of Ireland and AIB could require further capital.  In their view, both banks will require further capital.  Will Mr. Duffy give me his view, from an AIB perspective, on the possibility that further capital might be required?  The last time he appeared before this committee, he mentioned that the chairman of his bank had requested voluntary contributions from pension entitlements from former senior bank executives.  I wonder how that played out in the end.  Did the former senior bank executives agree to make voluntary contributions from their very hefty and, in some cases, overly generous pensions?  Perhaps Mr. Duffy will respond to those questions first.  I will come back in if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300039#QQ00700","speaker":"1106","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1378232700,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I will begin by speaking about the second matter raised by the Deputy.  I went through it earlier for the rest of his colleagues.  The letters were sent to the senior executives in the bank.  Every one of them responded.  One person responded publicly.  The other individuals engaged on the basis that whatever they chose to do would be treated confidentially.  As I said to Deputy Donnelly, I cannot disclose anything further in this regard for that reason.  The process did happen.  There was a positive set of interactions subsequently.<\/p><p>  The Deputy also referred to Fitch and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's.  We have to be very careful about what we mean in this context.  Do we need more capital right now?  Will we need more capital in three years' time or after Basel III?  What does it mean?  If we need more capital, how will we get it?  It depends on the timing.  Where we are is very clear.  We see ourselves as the best capitalised bank in terms of the major players in this country.  We have a very heavy load of provisions.  We hope they will help us to work through all of the arrears and other structural issues in terms of negative influences on capital.  We have a plan to return to profitability.  On that basis, we have modelled out to Basel III.  We think we have a reasonable amount of capital today.  We hope we have sufficient capital for Basel III in 2018.  It will not be within our control.  If the regulators or the Europeans under European supervision set different criteria or incremental capital hurdles, we may not have sufficient capital.  Based on what we know today and the actions we are taking today, we think we are well capitalised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300040#RR00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy"},{"type":"speech","time":1378232700,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I would like to return to an issue that was pursued by Senator Barrett.

Indeed, public representatives may need to be educated as well.  If people in these circumstances sell their homes and AIB takes the hit, where will they live next?  How will they be able to get a mortgage?  Can the bank guarantee they will get a mortgage?  I would like someone to explain how this works.  We are talking about a man and a woman of 35 and 34 years of age with an eight year old child.  When AIB gave them the money at the time, it accepted that they would be able to pay it back.

The person in question was employed in the construction industry at the time.  While I am not refuting the core principle, the salary when the mortgage was originated was not quite at the multiples that may appear from this case study.  In this case, the best option presumably would be to rent in the locale.  Allowing for rent in the locale in question, I suspect this option is doable, while social housing is another option.

My constituent proposed that, at the end of the 18-month period, the repayment would increase to &euro;1,200 or possibly even a higher monthly amount.

Some of them have done so only recently, including Mr. Duffy.<\/p><p>  The Irish banking sector is a very messy place to be in.  We are talking about the overview of the financial sector.  In September 2009 I first exercised myself on this issue here and looked at the six Irish owned banks and their balance sheets, loans and deposit ratios.  At the time Irish Nationwide Building Society was at a figure of 154%, AIB at 155%, Bank of Ireland at 161%, the EBS at 167%, Anglo Irish Bank at 195% and Irish Life and Permanent at 300%.  This tells the story of how the mess occurred.  There was a five-year turbo-charged trajectory of credit, coming from bond investors, as well as interbank money from abroad supplementing thin capital bases and two small depositor bases, for the size of loans being made.  Over a five to six year period these loans and this money created a turbo-charged overpricing of all assets - business and household.  Now the banking industry is stating - now that it has all burst and the tide has gone out - it is entitled to collect all of the loans it made, 100%, for assets that have disappeared. <\/p><p>  Let us take, for example, the AIB situation.  There is nothing personal in this, as I admire the delegates for doing battle on this issue.  However, the board of AIB and the boards and senior managements of all the other banks deserve to be caned for their ignorance or downright recklessness in causing a lost generation of financial galley slaves.  What has happened is wrong.  Deputy Higgins spoke the truth when he said the losses of the banking system should have been brought to the bond investors and the euro system that had refinanced the bonds because Anglo Irish Bank had received &euro;24 billion in three tranches of pro-note support and money to pay off bondholders.

I want to touch on the issue of new mortgage lending because what we are all trying to achieve here is normalisation in the housing market, not recovery in terms of going into another housing boom.  By normalisation I mean the type of prudent lending practices we had in the past where the ratio of people's incomes were reflective of the type of loans they got, where deposits were required and we had mortgage schedules that were somewhat realistic in that half way through, people who had children going to university did not have another cost coming in the door, so to speak.

Our objective is to grow our share of our book associated with mortgages as we go forward and for reasons we have talked about earlier, the book will continue to delever - pay down - unless we lend more on the mortgage.  The book was somewhere between &euro;20 billion and &euro;40 billion per annum at its peak.  Currently, if it is down &euro;2.5 billion or &euro;3 billion, all that happens is that the balance sheet keeps shrinking.  That is not in anyone's interest and therefore we want to lend more to the mortgage market, but we want to do it responsibly, and that is based on affordability.  The key criterion now is based on affordability.  It is not a multiple of salary.

The sector should have been operating to the principles of 90% loans to deposit.  That is called fractional reserving - reserving 10% liquidity on the loan side of the balance sheet.  It did not do that for six years and now we have this wreckage.  It is a tsunami and it is wrong that the people are in this hopelessness.  It is just wrong and I will do everything and strain everything I can since I started the analysis of the overall banking sector.<\/p><p> I would love to see an update of the six balance sheets.  EBS has now merged with AIB and Irish Life and Permanent is gone as well, but there is still the core of the balance sheets that were there four years ago that could be looked at and examined to see the funding on these.  By the funding, I include the euro system.  AIB says it has &euro;15 billion or &euro;16 billion from the ECB.  It has some from the Central Bank.  These guys should have been told before the promissory note was swapped into a series of 40-year bonds.  That promissory note was created in three tranches.  Mr. Honohan was a co-author of it with the euro system so there was never going to be a chance that our establishment and institutions would press the case hard with advocacy for a write-down on a euro system asset and for us, a euro system liability.  However, if the two remaining pillar banks got &euro;30 billion in a euro system creditor buy-in, our economy would be like a swamp drained.  We would have a fertile country in which families and businesses could begin to work again meaningfully and not be depressed.  I know I am speaking the truth.<\/p><p> Some people here did not even understand what happens with the transfer of loans into NAMA.  NAMA in turn is selling some of those loans, some of which contain miscalculated interest about which I also know.  That means that those loans are contaminated because they have rolled up capitalised interest.  Buyers on a third-party basis for the third time will be buying loans with embedded toxic, miscalculated interest.  That is like getting a diamond necklace containing three stolen diamonds.  The law is not yet up to speed on this and reckless lending.  The High Court does not even recognise reckless lending.  I know that from Bill Prasifka who said that one of the problems he faces in dealing with complaints is that the law does not recognise it.  That is a technicality.  I showed the committee.  Subtracting 155% from 90% results in 65% over a six year period of over-indulgence and splashing money that came from bond investors.  A figure of 65% as a proportion of 90%, which is the base rate of prudential lending, is two thirds so the argument is very valid.  I think Mr. O'Connor has previously heard that two thirds of the debt outstanding on the collapsed asset prices is not financially, morally or logically collectible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FIJ2013090300047#YY01500","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1378236900,"counter":511,"content":"<p>I think I heard 92% loan to value.
