It also provides funding for Civil Defence and the Irish Red Cross Society. Separately, Vote 35 provides for expenditure on Military Pensions. <\/p>  <p>  On an annual basis, the Defence Group budget is determined within the overarching budgetary framework and approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, having regard to the level of resources available and defence policy requirements. Capital funding allocations are also framed by the multi-annual National Development Plan. <\/p>  <p>  International comparison of military expenditure are made difficult by the lack of publicly available data, and by the breadth of difference between nations in their international security and defence policies. In addition, there is no EU requirement for Ireland to achieve any specific percentage of GDP target in relation to Defence expenditure. It should also be noted that the Central Statistics Office (CSO), in introducing Modified Gross National Income (GNI*), have recognised that the figures for Ireland&rsquo;s GDP are significantly impacted by the effects of globalisation.<\/p>  <p>  As such, the international perspective is best used for context rather than comparison between militaries. <\/p>  <p>  Against that background and using the latest data published by the European Defence Agency, details on defence spending as a % of national income across EU Member States in 2020 indicates the level of Irish expenditure on defence, at 0.5% of GNI*, is lower than other neutral1 EU states such as Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta, and Cyprus.  <\/p>  <p>  However, it is worth noting that within the resources allocated to Defence, the Defence Forces make a significant contribution to domestic security, provide a broad range of supports to the civil authorities, undertake roles such as Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) and fishery protection and are widely respected for their contribution to international peace and security.

At that same date, 34 recruits had discharged from the Defence Forces in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  In response to the deputy on psychometric testing, this testing forms part of the recruitment and candidate assessment process for General Service recruits, Air Corps Apprentices and Cadets. The military authorities have advised that, in 2021, there was 41% test failure rate associated with psychometric tests for Cadets and 60% for other recruitment. Two companies are involved in providing and administering these psychometric tests: Mindmill in respect of General Service Recruits and Cadets; and AON in respect of Air Corps Apprentices. The types of psychometric tests utilised include verbal, analytical, and abstract reasoning. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to retention, in addition to pay increases arising from the Public Service Pay Commission report and from public sector pay agreements, a number of other initiatives have been introduced. For example, the service commitment schemes in the Air Corps and Naval Service, and the sea-going naval personnel tax credit of &euro;1,500 which has been extended into 2022. <\/p>  <p>  I have also secured agreement to allow for an extension in service limits for Privates and Corporals, who were recruited since 1 January 1994, to remain in service up to 50 years of age, subject to them meeting certain criteria including medical and fitness standards.

LOA 2 would address specific priority gaps to improve on-island and overseas capabilities. LOA 3, would bring Ireland in line with other small neutral European countries in terms of spend. I am on the record as saying that LOA 2 is the minimum that we should aim for. This level of ambition will require an additional 2000 personnel beyond the establishment figure of 9,500 and an increase in the defence budget of some 50%.

From the 13th to the 17th September the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company endured almost continuous attack. At the end of the Siege, the men were taken into captivity until finally released on the 25th October 1961. <\/p>  <p>  The issue of awarding of Military Medals for Gallantry (MMG) and Distinguished Service Medals (DSMs) to a number of personnel who served in Jadotville in September 1961 has been considered on a number of occasions over the years and a range of actions have taken place to give due recognition to the courage and bravery of all the members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion who were stationed in Jadotville in 1961. The range of actions taken to date to recognise the bravery of the men stationed in Jadotville in 1961 include:<\/p>  <p>  - A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  - Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006.  <\/p>  <p>  - In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. A Congo photographic book was also produced for the occasion; a section of which was dedicated to the events at Jadotville in 1961.  <\/p>  <p>  - A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011.  <\/p>  <p>  - On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, it was decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  - On 13th June 2017, the Government decided, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place in Custume Barracks, Athlone on 2nd December 2017.  It is from Custume Barracks that &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.  The &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; has the word &ldquo;Jadotville&rdquo; depicted on the clasp of the medal and the medal ribbon represents a combination of an Irish tricolour and the United Nations Operation in Congo (ONUC) mission medal. The medal depicts a warrior of the ancient Fianna with sword and shield. To the left is a reproduction of the Irish overseas flash. Surrounding the central motif are the words &ldquo;Cosaint Chalma&rdquo; (Valiant Defence) and &ldquo;Misneach&rdquo; (Courage). The reverse contains a unique unit identification representing A Coy, 35 Cathlan Eireannach (Irish Battalion).  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the actions that have been taken to date to recognise and honour the valiant actions and bravery of all of the men stationed at Jadotville sixty years ago, an Independent Review Group (IRG) was established to examine and report on matters relating to recommendations for military medals relating to events at Jadotville.  The Group reported in July 2021.   <\/p>  <p>  The report, which was published in full, is substantial and makes a number of recommendations in respect of the issue of award of medals, honouring the role of families and the support they provided to veterans and in respect of veterans affairs.  <\/p>  <p>  The deeply unsettling aftermath of Jadotville is detailed in the report as is the lack of personal welfare supports afforded to the men following events at Jadotville, their period in captivity and upon their return home. I have apologised to veterans and to their families on behalf of the State and the Government to the men of &lsquo;A&rsquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to their families for the lack of necessary supports or deserved recognition of their valiant service on their return from the Congo and for the many issues that arose as a result, some of which had tragic consequences.  I have also acknowledged that the lack of supports in place at that time is extremely regrettable.  There have been great steps in the intervening years to support Defence Forces personnel, their families and veterans through the work of the Defence Forces personnel support services.   <\/p>  <p>  A judicial review is under way at present regarding a recommendation of the IRG report relating to the convening of a Military Board to consider the award of medals. Given that the matter is now before the Courts, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the report at this time. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied, however, that the matter has been addressed comprehensively and there are no plans to commence a process of further engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200064#WRB02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":75,"content":"<p>Question No. 37 answered with Question No. 34.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":76,"content":"<p>Question No. 38 answered with Question No. 19.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cybersecurity Policy","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200064#WRB02400"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[23495\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200064#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":" if his Department carried out investigations into the HSE cyber-attack in May 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":79,"content":"<p>My colleague Minister Ryan, as Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, retains overall responsibility for cyber security at a national level but, of course, the response to cyber threats is a whole-of-Government challenge with inputs in the security domain from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.

Within that capital allocation, the defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020 was completed following extensive joint civil-military work. It provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. <\/p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process. <\/p>  <p>  Modern secure communications are essential for the Defence Forces and in that regard Defence Force personnel are suitably equipped in a variety of roles with required communications and global positioning systems (GPS) equipment. GPS systems are used to aid navigation and as a force protection measure. They are integrated on board vehicles, vessels and aircraft control systems and embedded in communications systems used by Defence Force personnel in order to achieve a Joint Common Operating Picture. <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the Military Authorities that the Defence Forces operate many different types of radar systems. Existing capabilities available to the Army include radar systems such as the Giraffe Mk4 short-range air defence system and the Foxtrack X-Band ground surveillance radar. The Air Corps use surface search radar on the CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft and all aircraft are fitted with a transponder and the automatic identification system (AIS) for identification and tracking. The Naval Service use maritime surface search radar and the Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) systems for surveillance and tracking. <\/p>  <p>  It remains Government policy, as per the 2015 White Paper on Defence, that should additional funding, beyond that provided for in existing plans becomes available, the development of a radar surveillance capability for the Air Corps, will be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course. Two Inshore Patrol Vessels have been purchased from the New Zealand Government to replace L&Eacute; Orla and L&Eacute; Ciara, it is expected these vessels will be transported to Ireland in 2023 following the completion of a programme of works.<\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service is equipped with a various surveillance equipment in order to undertake the roles assigned by Government, including certain capabilities that allow for underwater search and surveying, for example, an underwater remotely operated vehicle, ROV, and a magnetometer system. As part of the ongoing development of capabilities, further capabilities that will enhance the Naval Service&rsquo;s under-sea situational awareness, such as multibeam echo sounder systems, are also being developed.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Government established an independent Commission on the Defence Forces in December 2020. The work of the Commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and their report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200065#WRC03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":124,"content":"<p>Question No. 58 answered with Question No. 24.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":126,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 59 to 65, inclusive, answered orally.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD00400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Policy","counter":127,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD00300"},{"type":"question","counter":128,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[23660\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her strategy to improve access to the transition year programme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1602","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":129,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 29 March I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined Senior Cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience. <\/p><p>In my announcement I set out a clear vision for Senior Cycle, building upon the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment&rsquo;s (NCCA&rsquo;s) Advisory Report.

Drawing on the feedback from this consultation, the refined DEIS identification model builds on the objectivity and fairness of the 2017 version, but now captures a greater breadth of disadvantage and accounts for severity of disadvantage through the application of a weighted process. It also takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Travellers and Roma learners and of students residing in direct provision or state funded emergency homeless accommodation.

NEPS is a school-based service which means that all its psychologists work in schools with children, young people, teachers and parents, and are involved with school-related work, every day.  The NEPS psychologist provides a range of services that may include supporting the well-being and inclusion of an individual pupil, through assessment and intervention.  NEPS supports approximately 8000 individual children annually through this type of work.  NEPS work also supports teachers in their work through providing professional learning opportunities, such as about trauma informed approaches, supporting autistic children, or delivering the Friends for Life programmes to help reduce anxiety.  NEPS supports an estimated 25,000 teachers annually in this way. <\/p>  <p>The Department &ndash; through NEPS, Student Support Teams, Guidance Counsellors and other services - will also continue to signpost schools and students to the HSE\/HSE-funded e-mental health services. The Department has built strong links with the Department of Health and both Departments are exploring ways to improve supports for young people, including around increased awareness, promoting help-seeking behaviour and sign-posting to the wide range of available services.  We will continue to collectively explore ways of improving supports for children and young people.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":163,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":164,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[22472\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200066#WRD04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the steps that she is taking to ensure the delivery of an effective visiting teachers for children with hearing and visual impairments service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":165,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was assigned responsibility for the management and direction of the Visiting Teachers Service for children with hearing or visual impairment with effect from 20th March 2017.

Schools participating in my Department&rsquo;s DEIS Programme receive an enhanced rate of book grant. <\/p>  <p>  School book rental schemes have an important role to play in reducing the cost of school books for parents and guardians. In order to support the establishment of book rental schemes, my Department provided &euro;15.7 million seed capital in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to all primary schools.   <\/p>  <p>  From the information available to my Department currently, approximately 96% of all primary schools and 69% of all post-primary schools operate a book rental scheme. <\/p>  <p>  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school to decide on its own policy in relation to the use of book grant funding in the school. Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. The current arrangement relies on the local knowledge of the school in order to ensure a fair allocation of funds to those students most in need. <\/p>  <p>  Additional funding of &euro;1million was provided under Budget 2020 to provide free books in DEIS primary schools on a pilot basis.

It will continue to run for the 2021\/22 school year and its effectiveness and impact will be monitored and evaluated before any decision is made as regards its possible extension or continuation. It is my intention to complete this process as soon as possible. Under Circular 46\/2013, DEIS primary schools receive a book grant of &euro;21 per pupil.  This pilot provided an additional &euro;64 per pupil to increase the overall book grant rate to &euro;85 per pupil enrolled in the school. This is in line with the costings as set out in the 2019 Barnardos report on the Real Cost of School which states that &euro;85 is the average cost of school books at primary school. <\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;20 million is being made available in 2022 to enable schools (primary and post-primary) to purchase books, audio books and other media for the purposes of improving their existing literacy resource banks.

My Department is currently working collaboratively with a number of Departments and organisations to ensure a whole of Government approach to support education provision for arriving children with immediate education needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I and my Government colleagues have also received regular updates at Cabinet on supports for people arriving from Ukraine in order to ensure appropriate coordination and integration of each Department&rsquo;s response. It was agreed that a co-ordinated, whole-of-Government response will be essential. Particular emphasis was placed on the need for co-ordination across Government of policy, the implementation of actions and communications.<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, my Department is engaging closely with colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.\u00a0My Department is also working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of the relationship between the location of\u00a0the accommodation provided for people arriving from Ukraine and the identification of appropriate school capacity.<\/p>  <p>  Regional Education and Language Teams (REALT)\u00a0have been\u00a0established to help ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children arriving in Ireland.\u00a0 These Education and Language Teams are hosted by the 16 regional education and training boards (ETBs) and are staffed by existing regionally-based education support personnel working closely together to ensure good coordination and alignment of supports for Ukrainian children. My Department is liaising with the teams to ensure all necessary supports for the Ukrainian children are provided as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The primary role of the REALT is to build on existing regional education support structures and the initial focus will be on assisting families in securing school places. REALT will also support schools in the area to meet the needs of these children as they emerge, to advise and support my Department in developing new capacity where required, and to co-ordinate the provision of education services to schools and families across their defined area.<\/p>  <p>  These teams will ensure that clear, accessible information flows are in place between schools, local education support services and national support structures in relation to people arriving from Ukraine.<\/p>  <p>  The regional teams will be hosted and administratively supported within the ETBs and will lead a network of other key agencies, including Tusla Education Support Service (TESS), NEPS regional personnel, NCSE regional personnel and Management body local nominees working together with local schools. <\/p>  <p>  Many resources for teaching, learning and inclusion of Ukrainian pupils have been published to date, including a central repository of information and CPD resources for school leaders and teachers to support cultural and linguistic diversity, which is available on the Scoilnet.ie website. <\/p>  <p>  These\u00a0resources include those designed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to help children suffering from trauma. NEPS psychologists are available on the ground to consult with schools and provide support as needed. <\/p>  <p>  Resources also include EAL, intercultural and relevant curriculum supports developed by the teacher education supports services including PDST, the NCCA and the ETB sector. A helpline for school principals is also in place. Schools that have enrolled students from Ukraine can apply for additional EAL support and hundreds of schools are already receiving this support. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to ensure that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will be available to support schools that have children from Ukraine with additional or special educational needs. Local Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) will be available to support individual families in accessing education and related supports for their children with special education needs. In this regard the SENOs will link with other relevant state agencies including Education Welfare Services and the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  I recently announced that a summer 2022 education programme for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.

Assessment Officers under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the Assessment of Need.  The Assessment Officer makes the determination as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the act and coordinates and completes the Assessment Report.<\/p>  <p>  Following a recent High Court ruling in October 2021 there is now a requirement on the education system to provide an assessment of Education Needs as part of the Assessment of Need Process. My Department is considering its implications.  The Department are working with the Department of Health, the NCSE and the HSE and taking legal advice. I expect to receive a proposal on the matter shortly.  <\/p>  <p>  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government. This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p>  <p>  This includes additional teaching and care supports. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p>  <p>  Throughout 2020 and 2021, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year. I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering. Through this intensive intervention, we have seen an additional 300 special classes, providing over 1,800 new places, opened nationwide for the 2021\/22 school-year. <\/p>  <p>  I also acknowledge that notwithstanding the extent of this investment, there are some parts of the country where increases in population and other issues have led to concerns regarding a shortage of school places.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents and seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of Cavan and Monaghan, I can confirm that the NCSE is aware of an identified need for additional special classes for students with autism in primary and post-primary schools.  Work has been underway with stakeholders for a number of years to meet the demand for places. We are always grateful to those schools that have responded, and continue to respond positively to meet the educational needs of children in their communities.<\/p>  <p>  There is currently a network of 57 special classes for students requiring an autism class placement in counties Cavan and Monaghan of which 44 are primary (including 8 Early Intervention ASD classes) and 13 are post primary. These 57 classes include 6 new autism special classes (3 at primary and 3 at post primary level) which opened in September 2021 providing 36 additional places.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022\/2023 school year. These additional classes will provide over 1,700 new places in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE is continuing to engage with primary and post-primary schools throughout Cavan and Monaghan regarding the establishment of additional special classes for 2022\/23 and beyond. There are specific plans in place to open additional special classes and every support will be made available to progress their opening in the shortest possible timeframe with a particular focus on September next.  It is of course open to any school to engage with the NCSE to establish a special class. <\/p>  <p>  I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[23678\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address the concerns of a school (details supplied) in relation to the reduction of special\u00a0education\u00a0teaching support and difficulties being faced by schools particularly with the new special\u00a0education\u00a0teaching support allocation model; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1480","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p>  <p>  Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The SET allocation model has been in place since 2017.The allocation model, which was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), is designed to distribute the total available number of Special Education Teachers across primary and post primary schools based on the relative need of each school, as evidenced by a number of key indicators. <\/p>  <p>  Special Education Teachers provide additional teaching support for students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes in primary and post primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  The SET model is a fairer and more transparent way of allocating teaching resources to schools.<\/p>  <p>  The number of teaching posts to support the SET model continues to increase. Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022\/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. <\/p>  <p>  The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.  <\/p>  <p>  The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act<\/p>  <p>  When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer\/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.   <\/p>  <p>  Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p>  <p>  A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p>  <p>  The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p>  <p>  Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p>  <p>  It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. <\/p>  <p>  These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p>  <p>  A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. <\/p>  <p>  If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie\/for-schools<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":255,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":256,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[23656\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the reform of the senior cycle; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1597","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":257,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, on 29 March I announced an ambitious programme of work for a reimagined Senior Cycle of education where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience. <\/p><p>The three tenets of Senior Cycle reform are to:<\/p><p>- Empower students to meet the challenges of the 21st century<\/p><p>- Enrich the student experience and build on what&rsquo;s strong in our current system<\/p><p>- Embed well-being and reduce student stress levels<\/p><p>Introducing significant change at Senior Cycle needs to be thought through carefully and it is essential to ensure that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), State Examinations Commission (SEC), the Department and schools can work through the changes with all stakeholders over a sustained period of time.<\/p><p>I know that there is an appetite for change in respect of different aspects of the Senior Cycle and Leaving Cert experience and that this desire has been massively accelerated and strengthened since the arrival of the pandemic.  <\/p><p>Among the changes I announced on 29 March are:<\/p><p>- introduction of new curricula for subjects across Senior Cycle, updating subject content;<\/p><p>- the introduction of new subjects, providing greater choice for students to better reflect their range of interests and support the development of a wider range of talents and skills.

RSE is required at all levels in schools, from primary through to Senior Cycle. <\/p>  <p>  All schools are required to have an RSE policy that is developed in consultation with the school community, including school management, parents, teachers and students as appropriate. The school&rsquo;s programme for Relationship and Sexuality Education is developed and taught in the context of the school&rsquo;s RSE policy.  In addition, schools are required to teach all aspects of the RSE programme, including family planning, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation. It is important to note that the ethos of the school should never preclude learners from acquiring the knowledge about the issues.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment was requested to conduct a review of RSE provision in Irish schools, focussing on a range of topics including healthy positive, sexual expression and relationships and LGBTQ+ matters. The NCCA published &ldquo;The Report on the Review of Relationships and Sexuality Education in primary and post-primary schools&rdquo; in December, 2019.<\/p>  <p>  This report resulted in the NCCA establishing two development groups, one for primary and one for post-primary, to oversee the work of developing an updated curriculum materials in this area and supporting the development of guidance material for schools. <\/p>  <p>  The immediate focus of the NCCA work has been on creating support materials for teachers as part of an Interim Guidance Toolkit. This Toolkit aims to support effective teaching and learning of SPHE\/RSE and to deepen teachers' understanding and skills in addressing important and sensitive topics. <\/p>  <p>  The NCCA Toolkit is being expanded in 2022 to include further age and stage appropriate guidance for teachers on how to address these topics within the SPHE classroom. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with this work, preparation for the broader redeveloping and updating of the SPHE curriculum has begun. Updated curricula will be developed for Primary, Junior Cycle and Senior Cycle.  <\/p>  <p>  A draft revised Junior Cycle specification is due to be agreed at NCCA Council in early Summer, with a public consultation to follow. The final revised specification is due to be completed by the end of 2022. <\/p>  <p>  Preparation to update the Senior Cycle SPHE\/RSE specification has commenced and it is intended that a meeting of the Senior Cycle development group will be convened in the next week. This group will prepare a background paper and brief which will form the basis of their work of redeveloping the Senior Cycle SPHE\/RSE specification. <\/p>  <p>  Following publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework, expected in early 2023, NCCA will establish a development group for the curricular area of Well-being. Learning pertaining to RSE in primary school will be addressed within the curricular area of Well-being and the subjects of Physical and Health Education and Social, Personal and Values Education. This development group will work on the development of a specification for the curricular area and corresponding subjects. This advice will be developed through research, deliberation, consultation, and engagement with networks.  <\/p>  <p>  In redeveloping the SPHE curriculum, the NCCA will be making explicit the importance of fostering young people's self-awareness and self-esteem and building the foundational skills and dispositions needed for building caring and healthy relationships (including respectful communication, showing empathy, and appreciating difference). <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to best give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to develop inclusive and age-appropriate RSE and SPHE curricula across primary and post-primary levels, including an inclusive programme on LGBTI+ relationships and making appropriate legislative changes, if necessary. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":261,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":262,"qnumday":113,"qnumall":"[23661\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her strategy to ensure that all new school buildings meet universal design principles; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1456","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":263,"content":"<p>I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of modern, accessible school accommodation is a priority for my Department.

The overall site is circa 10 acres. My Department made a submission to the Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Draft Development Plan 2022-28 in April 2021 seeking to have the zoning on the school site changed from Objective F Open Space to Objective SNI purposes (Sustainable Neighbourhood Infrastructure) &lsquo;to protect, improve and encourage the provision of sustainable neighbourhood infrastructure&rsquo; which would have effectively removed the 60% open space requirement.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing school accommodation capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  A national inventory of school capacity, which utilises information from schools&rsquo; annual returns, is maintained by my Department and is supplemented by data on enrolment trends at individual schools as well as other indicators of potential capacity.  My Department&rsquo;s GIS is a critical tool in assessing such data in support of strategic planning for school accommodation needs.  The GIS facilitates the geospatial analysis of capacity relative to school place demand and the customised reporting of data at local, regional and national levels.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at primary level national enrolments peaked in 2018 and are projected to decline by over 120,000 by 2033, as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s statistical report of November 2021: &ldquo;Projections of full-time enrolment Primary and Second Level 2021-2040&rdquo;.  In that same report it can be seen that post primary enrolments are forecast to peak in 2024 and then decline thereafter to 2039, by circa 90,000 places.  Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure.  While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools. In this regard, a capacity survey at post-primary level has indicated available capacity of the order of 18,000 to 20,000 school places.  There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town\/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May\/early June 2022.   <\/p>  <p>  Where the geospatial assessment of demand and capacity in an area indicates that additional provision is required my Department considers the options of extending the capacity of a school or schools, or of providing a new school or schools.  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; for example a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, where a school considers that it has a requirement for additional mainstream or special education needs accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply under my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.  The assessment of such applications is also informed by a geospatial analysis of demand and capacity in the relevant area, and a consideration of the timing and duration of the need.  The level of capacity in an individual school or in neighbouring schools is relevant when decisions on enrolment are being made.  It is important that capacity across a town or area is fully utilised before additional accommodation is approved.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to advance school building projects to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands.  The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives. Good progress continues to be made with the rollout of projects, and the current status of projects being delivered is listed in tabular format, on a county by county basis, on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.gov.ie and updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Curriculum","counter":279,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04100"},{"type":"question","counter":280,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[23663\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her Department&rsquo;s strategy to support digital skills in schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":281,"content":"<p>The new Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published on the 17<sup>th<\/sup>April and has at its core the aim of empowering schools to further embed digital technologies across their teaching, learning and assessment.  It sets out how the development of digital skills are supported in schools and builds on the key achievements under the previous strategy.  It aligns closely with the EU Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 and also takes into consideration the National Digital Strategy &lsquo;Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework as well as other relevant policies and strategies. It is available here www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/69fb88-digital-strategy-for-schools\/<\/p><p>The stated vision of the Digital Strategy is to empower schools to harness the opportunities of digital transformation to build digital competence and an effective digital education ecosystem so as to develop competent, critically engaged, active learners while supporting them to reach their potential and participate fully as global citizens in a digital world.<\/p><p>It is underpinned by an investment of &euro;200million, &euro;50million of which has already issued directly to schools.  A further &euro;13m is invested on an annual basis in the Schools Broadband Programme and a further &euro;50m was issued in grant funding in November 2021 as part of Ireland&rsquo;s National Recovery and Resilience Plan to address the digital divide. Through continued investment we will also ensure that all schools, regardless of location are provided with appropriate broadband connectivity. <\/p><p>The importance of the effective use of digital technologies in our school system is key to delivering the skills need for our current and future learners.  What is required, and what is incorporated in the stated vision of this strategy, is an education system that supports the development of competent, critically engaged and active learners.  This also requires the Department and its support services to continue to ensure that teachers and school leaders have access to the necessary supports and resources to facilitate this. <\/p><p>The strategy itself is set out under three pillars, which recognise how the various elements of our school system are involved and interlinked in supporting and progressing the use of digital technologies in our school system and how the Department can support this.  These are <\/p><p>- <b>Pillar 1:<\/b>Supporting the embedding of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment<\/p><p>- <b>Pillar 2:<\/b>Digital Technology Infrastructure<\/p><p>- <b>Pillar 3: <\/b>Looking to the future: policy, research and digital leadership<\/p><p>Each Pillar contains overarching objectives, which will be supported by a more detailed Implementation Plan.  The first Implementation Plan will run from 2022-2024.  Towards the end of this phase a midterm review will be carried out to inform the next Implementation Plan from 2025-2027.<\/p><p>It is intended to put in place appropriate oversight and measurement processes to ensure effective implementation of the strategy. This will include establishing relevant groups to provide oversight and inform ongoing implementation over the lifetime of the strategy including developments to avail of emerging technologies.  Delivering on the objectives of this strategy will involve ongoing collaboration across Government and with key stakeholders. Therefore it is planned to establish relevant consultative groups to facilitate engagement with education stakeholders and relevant industry representatives. <\/p><p>By combining the continued commitment shown by teachers and schools leaders with the effective use of digital technologies in their teaching practice, we can equip young people with the key digital skills they need for life. <\/p><p>The inclusion of digital learning skills as part of curriculum development will also support all learners to gain these skills as part of their education journey. <\/p><p>Substantial progress has been made across the curriculum with some examples including:<\/p><p>- All new and revised curricular specifications now include clear statements that focus on the development of digital learning skills. <\/p><p>- Introduction of the Primary Language Curriculum embeds digital literacy across its learning outcomes.<\/p><p>- Draft Primary Curriculum Framework (2020) outlines being a digital learner as one of seven key competencies intended to be embedded across all curriculum areas and subjects. It also proposes that digital technology would become part of the curriculum area of Mathematics, Science and Technology. <\/p><p>The Framework for Junior Cycle provides multiple opportunities for the development of digital skills. A set of twenty-four Statements of Learning are central to the student experience in junior cycle and schools must ensure that all statements of learning are offered to their junior cycle students. Statement 24 focuses explicitly on the development of digital skills setting out the expectation that the student uses technology and digital media tools to learn, communicate, work and think collaboratively and creatively in a responsible and ethical manner. The development of digital skills is further supported through the eight key skills of junior cycle. These key skills are embedded in the learning outcomes within each junior cycle subject and short course. Each key skill includes a number of elements with a digital element in each key skill.<\/p><p>Junior cycle students undertake a 400-hour programme of well-being as part of their junior cycle programme and this provides additional opportunity for the development of digital media literacy skills and digital citizenship skills through the short courses in CSPE and SPHE.  <\/p><p>In addition to this cross-curricular focus on digital skills, schools may choose to offer short courses which explicitly focus on the development of digital skills. NCCA have developed two such short courses in Coding and Digital Media Literacy and schools may also opt to develop their own short course.<\/p><p>At senior cycle the use of digital technology is an important aspect of many subjects.  The Leaving Certificate subject Computer Science is available nationally since September 2020. <\/p><p>Following my announcement on 29 March regarding a reimagined Senior Cycle where the student is at the centre of their Senior Cycle experience, I note the NCCA&rsquo;s intention to research the potential of technology to support greater diversity in approaches to assessment across Senior Cycle. This will allow for technology-enabled modes of assessment to be considered as part of the movement towards additional assessment components in each subject and the exploration of a school-based, externally moderated form of assessment of such components. Indeed, recent second assessment components developed by the SEC have been &lsquo;Designed for Digital&rsquo;. This exploration should of course have regard to the requirement for integration with the Digital Strategy for Schools.<\/p><p>Furthermore, work on the opportunities technology offers to support the availability of subject choice to students will be undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":282,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04400"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[23814\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200068#WRF04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on the provision of summer language classes for children fleeing from Ukraine; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1617","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>On the 3<sup>rd<\/sup>of May, Minister Madigan and I announced a summer education programme for pupils with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage for summer 2022.<\/p><p>Building on the successful 2021 programme, all schools (primary and post-primary) will once again be encouraged to provide summer programmes including post-primary children with complex needs and children at risk of educational disadvantage. <\/p><p>The Inclusion element of the programme also offers an opportunity for schools to address the needs of migrant students such as addressing English language skills and integration, including students who have recently arrived in Ireland from Ukraine.

On its publication, Minister of State for Public Health, Well-being and the National Drugs Strategy, Frank Feighan, T.D, identified as a priority &lsquo;the need to address the social determinants and consequences of drug use and criminality in disadvantaged communities&rsquo; requiring the involvement and co-operation of a range of government department and agencies in tackling the root causes of drug and alcohol use.  To address  priorities over the remaining period of the Strategy, six strategic priorities have been identified in the review to strengthen the health-led approach to drug use and to align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan.  <\/p>  <p>  The first priority is to strengthen the prevention of drug use and its associated harms among children and young people.  My Department will participate in the work of the dedicated Strategic Implementation Group established by the Department of Health to lead on this priority. <\/p>  <p>  Schools also play an important role  in supporting their students to develop the skills and knowledge they need to make informed choices when faced with difficult issues including drugs and alcohol which unfortunately most of them will face.  This is mainly done through the Social, Personal and Health Education Programme which has a specific module on the use and misuse of a range of substances.  SPHE is currently mandatory in all primary schools and in junior cycle.  It forms part of the mandatory Well-being area of learning for the new junior cycle introduced in 2017.  SPHE along with the implementation of the Well-being Policy Statement and Framework 2018-2023 aim to support the development of socially and emotionally competent, resilient young people who respect themselves, their peers and are able to form healthy relationships and make healthy life choices and decisions. Schools are also encouraged to deliver the SPHE programme in senior cycle.  Topics within SPHE include student decision-making skills, safety and protection.  Students learn how to exercise judgement, weigh up different possibilities, examine the steps and choices they take to inform decision making and develop the ability to assess the consequences of poor decisions and risky behaviour. Schools also have access to a number of resources to support the delivery of the substance use module of SPHE. Examples include the \"Walk Tall\" Programme for primary pupils developed by the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST) and a post-primary resource called \"On My Own Two Feet\", published by my Department. The new 'Know the Score' programme is a substance misuse programme published in 2019 for Transition Year or 5th year pupils. It was jointly developed by the HSE, my Department and the Drugs and Alcohol Task Forces.<\/p>  <p>  In order to strengthen links between schools and local Drug and Alcohol Task Forces, last year an information resource was developed and circulated to all 4,000 primary and post primary schools.  Developed by the Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in conjunction with my Department, the resource provides information on the range of supports that drug and alcohol task forces can provide to schools, parents and students to prevent and tackle drug and alcohol use and to strengthen communications between local schools and drug and alcohol task forces.  It also provides information on a range of valuable resources for schools and parents relating to drug and alcohol use.<\/p>  <p>  My Department currently provides funding to 3 projects in Local Drugs Task Force Areas in Dublin.  These are the Blanchardstown Early School Leavers Project, Crinan Youth Project (Salesian Youth Enterprises) and Familibase.<\/p>  <p>  There are also range of supports available to schools in Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City area.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.  The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs. The policy advice was considered by the Department and it was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the participating SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over a 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs.  Each phase of the programme has been fully subscribed to date. 500 have completed the programme and the first award ceremony took place on the 25 February 2022. A new cohort of 1,000 commenced the programme September last.  <\/p>  <p>  This programme allowed SNAs the opportunity to refresh and update their knowledge and skills and provide an opportunity to interact with educators and colleagues in a learning and supported professional environment. <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in schools and is tailored to their needs.  As this is the first programme, it is appropriate to take the time to review outcomes which will inform the future approach to ongoing training and professional development of SNAs. Part of that consideration will include accreditation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":345,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH01300"},{"type":"question","counter":346,"qnumday":142,"qnumall":"[23697\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the extent of forward planning undertaken by her Department to ensure that all children with special educational needs receive a suitable school place in their local area.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":347,"content":"<p>Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this Government.<\/p><p>This year, my Department will spend in excess of &euro;2 Billion, or over 25% of the Department&rsquo;s budget on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>This includes additional teaching and care supports. <\/p><p>As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels. <\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. <\/p><p>Over the last two years, my Department and the NCSE have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined up planning process which has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school-year <\/p><p>I am satisfied that this more joined up approach is delivering.

Bearing in mind the significant assessment load at the end of sixth year, and to ensure a positive impact on students as soon as possible, as an interim measure I have asked the SEC to immediately alter the timing of Paper One in both Irish and English so that Paper One would take place at the end of fifth year commencing for fifth years entering fifth year in September 2023.<\/p>  <p>  It is also my intention that in the future Oral examinations and the Music practical performance will take place during the first week of the Easter break of 6th year as was the case this year. The advice of the SEC on the implementation of these changes on a permanent basis, following an evaluation of the arrangements in 2022 by the SEC, will be duly considered in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  To enhance students&rsquo; options further, Leaving Certificate Applied (LCA) students will have improved access to Mathematics and Modern Foreign Languages from September 2022, broadening the options for LCA students.<\/p>  <p>  A Senior Cycle Programme Delivery Board will be established which will have responsibility for overseeing the achievement of actions forming part of this suite of reforms. A detailed implementation plan will be developed through ongoing collaboration and co-creation and consultation with education partners, including teachers, students, school leaders and parents.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":360,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH02800"},{"type":"question","counter":361,"qnumday":147,"qnumall":"[23828\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the situation in which special schools do not receive the same hours that are available to mainstream schools for children whose first language is not English; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":362,"content":"<p>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will also provide supports to special schools in line with the agreed EAL allocation in circumstances where there is a recognised level of need. <\/p><p>Schools can access a form to apply for these resources at the following link: <\/p><p>www.gov.ie\/en\/collection\/2d706-staffing-arrangements-at-post-primary-level-forms\/#form-u-eal-2022<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":363,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":364,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[23666\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of progress under the School Building Programme, including sustainability measures; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1545","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":365,"content":"<p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025.

This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of which are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible<\/p>  <p>  There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage. <\/p>  <p>  It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.<\/p>  <p>  During the period 2018 to 2021 691 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).  These projects delivered in excess of 64,000 school places. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification.<\/p>  <p>  New renewable technologies and approaches are tested to ensure compatibility with school design and operational requirements under the research programme.  Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).                           <\/p>  <p>  Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations,  along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.<\/p>  <p>  The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach.<\/p>  <p>  This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.  <\/p>  <p>  The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009\/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation\/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects.<\/p>  <p>  The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":367,"qnumday":149,"qnumall":"[23832\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200070#WRH03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her Department&rsquo;s position regarding the construction of a new secondary school in the east Cork catchment area; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":368,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a Geographical Information System to anticipate school place demand.

A ballot was undertaken and the result was 95% agreement in favour of the deal.  I am very pleased to hear of this overwhelmingly positive result on what has been a long running issue, the resolution of which has been a priority for me since my appointment. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for these staff under grant schemes, and that where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.  On that basis, there has been extensive engagement between my Department and school management bodies to work towards a resolution. I would also like to acknowledge the willingness of F&oacute;rsa and in particular the school secretary representatives for their constructive engagement in this process, and to recognise the support of Minister McGrath and his officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at all stages of the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The main elements of the package offered include, in recognition of the invaluable work carried out by school secretaries,  moving their pay rates to a scale which is aligned with the Clerical Officer Grade III pay scale on a pro rata basis according to a secretary&rsquo;s current working pattern. This process will provide for pay increases (backdated to 1 September 2021) to school secretaries who choose to move to the new terms. It also provides for lower-paid but longer serving secretaries to be placed higher up the salary scale.  Secretaries may also choose to receive additional pay to ensure they no longer need to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of benefits for periods when they are not working due to school holidays. The final element of the package will introduce standardised arrangements in respect of annual leave, maternity benefit and sick pay.<\/p>  <p>  The work to implement this agreement will include a complex process of assimilating each individual secretary to the new terms and conditions which will vary depending on individual circumstances. The Department will expedite this process and will communicate further as the work progresses.<\/p>  <p>  This offer relates only to school secretaries at present, while there is agreement in principle to take the same approach to the consideration of appropriate pay and conditions of grant funded caretakers there remains a deficit of data on working terms and conditions of such staff.

There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town\/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May\/early June 2022.   <\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that there is not sufficient existing capacity to meet school place requirements in an area and that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools, <\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools. <\/p>  <p>  Requirements for additional school accommodation provision across the country, including in the Ballyfermot_D10 school planning area, will continue to be kept under review.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work to advance projects to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future. My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands including in the Ballyfermot D10 area.  The current status of these approved projects is listed on a county by county basis on www.gov.ie and is regularly updated to reflect their progress through the various stages.  <\/p>  <p>  In regards to repurposing an old school site, when a school building becomes vacant as a result of closure, amalgamation or replacement, the future use of the old building is in the first instance a matter for the property owner. When the property owner applies to the Minister for permission to either use the property for community purposes or to sell it, my Department makes an assessment as to whether the property is required for future educational use. If it is concluded that the property has no viable future educational use, my Department permits that it may be used for community or other purposes or may be sold.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":386,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":387,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[23696\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the roll-out of the front-loading allocation model of special needs assistants; and if she will publish the criteria used to determine this allocation.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":388,"content":"<p>In December 2019, Government approved the national roll out of a new front-loading model for the allocation of Special Needs Assistant (SNAs) support to primary and post-primary schools for students in mainstream classes, as part of the phased roll out of the School Inclusion Model (SIM).<\/p><p>Unfortunately, due to the disruption caused by the Covid-19 public health crisis, it was not possible to implement the new allocation model for the 2020\/21 school year.<\/p><p>Working is ongoing on the allocation model and all stakeholders will be advised when the SNA allocation process has been completed and this will be done in line with previous years in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":390,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[23481\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200071#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention been drawn to a new report (details supplied) which details the experiences of non-religious teachers in schools with a religious ethos in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; her views on the recommendations of the report; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":391,"content":"<p>The Department is aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.

The system is intended to act as a conduit for key skills which are required to develop enterprise in the State for the benefit of our economy, while simultaneously protecting the balance of the labour market.  The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market, expanding and contracting in tandem with its inherent fluctuations.<\/p>  <p>  The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of the State and other EEA states.  However, where specific skills prove difficult to source within the EEA, an employment permit may be sought in respect of a non-EEA national who possess those skills.<\/p>  <p>  The employment permit system is managed through the operation of the critical skills and the ineligible occupations lists which determine employments that are either in high demand or are ineligible for consideration for an employment permit.  In order to maintain the relevance of these lists of occupations to the needs of the economy, they undergo twice-yearly evidence-based reviews.  These reviews are guided by research undertaken by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN), the Skills and the Labour Market Research Unit (SLMRU), SOLAS and include a public consultation process and extensive consultation with other Government Departments through the Interdepartmental Group on Economic Migration Policy.  Account is taken of education outputs, sectoral upskilling and training initiatives and known contextual factors such as Brexit and, in the current context, COVID-19 and their impact on the labour market.<\/p>  <p>  My Department experienced a significant increase in applications for employment permits in the past year, impacting on processing times.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, some 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 (16,293) and a 47% increase on 2019 (18,811), which itself represented an 11 year high in applications.  16,275 employment permits were issued in 2021, with a total of 17,968 applications processed which represents a significant volume of activity.  The increased demand was also driven by the extension of categories of employment permits, in particular for the agricultural sector, following the Review of the Occupational Lists announced  in October 2021.  This included 3,000 permits made available to the agricultural sector. <\/p>  <p>  My Department recognises the impact delays on the processing times for work permits has for businesses and their workers and has developed a plan of action to reduce processing times built up over the pandemic.  The plan includes both additional staffing and systemic changes.  The processing team has trebled in size and daily output has more than tripled compared to 2021 levels.  Internal processes have been streamlined and initiatives introduced which are all having an impact.  <\/p>  <p>  Since the implementation of this plan, the Employment Permits Unit has made positive progress to reduce the current backlog reducing the number of applications awaiting processing from c.11,000 in January 2022 to under 6,500 to date.  <\/p>  <p>  As new staff were trained on Critical Skills and Intra Corporate Transfer Employment Permits, processing times for those permits have fallen from 21 weeks to 6 weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  All flexible resources have now been redeployed to address processing times for General Employment permit applications which currently stand at 22 weeks.  My Department expects to see a consistent strong fall in waiting times for General Employment Permits, from mid-May, with processing times considerably reduced by end Q2.  In Q3 my Department will continue to drive down waiting times across all permit types.  <\/p>  <p>  Full details on current processing times are published on my Department&rsquo;s website - Current processing dates for employment permits - DETE (enterprise.gov.ie).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200072#WRK00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises","counter":417,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200072#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":418,"qnumday":166,"qnumall":"[24041\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200072#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the engagement he and his Department have had with SME's who are struggling with fuel and inflationary costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":419,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, Government have responded with up to &euro;2.1 billion in measures to date to mitigate the rising cost of living including a personal income tax package worth &euro;520 million, a social welfare package is &euro;550 million &amp;amp; we have reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of the month until the end of October. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has already implemented several measures to help ease the impact on enterprises of energy price increases including reductions in VAT and excise on some fuels, as well as a temporary grant scheme to hauliers.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this week the Government announced the extension of the 9% Value Added Tax (VAT) rate for the tourism and hospitality industry for a further six months; a measure for which &euro;250 million is the estimated cost to the exchequer which will derive value for the sector.<\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Enterprise Forum met most recently on 16th March 2022 and was convened at the request of the T&aacute;naiste to hear first-hand how the war in Ukraine is affecting businesses in Ireland.

The Government has put a range of policies and measures in place at national level to alleviate fuel and energy poverty. These measures supplement lower income households through the Fuel Allowance and other payments, as well as providing free energy efficiency upgrades through the SEAI schemes and the Social Housing retrofitting programme. Examples of key recent developments include:<\/p><p>-Budget 2022 incorporated a range of measures to support citizens with the rising cost of living.  These measures included increases to weekly social welfare payments, targeted measures with increases in the living alone allowance and the qualified child increase and a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, with that increase implemented immediately in October.  The weekly income threshold for Fuel Allowance was also increased by &euro;20 which enables more people to qualify for this support.<\/p><p>-Further measures were recently announced to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs.  As part of these measures an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the Fuel Allowance payment.  This lump sum payment, in addition to the Budget increase, will mean low-income households will see an increase of 41% this fuel allowance season when compared to last season. <\/p><p>-This year, 58% (&euro;203 million) of the total Government retrofit budget of &euro;352 million will be spent on dedicated energy poverty retrofit supports and local authority retrofits. These supports are available nationwide and are linked to a household&rsquo;s individual circumstances.<\/p><p>-A once-off payment of &euro;200 (inclusive of VAT) is being paid from April 2022 onwards to all domestic electricity accounts as part of the Government&rsquo;s package of measures to provide further support to households in the context of increased living costs.<\/p><p>In addition to the measures outlined above, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has in place a suite of protections against disconnection that are set out in the Supplier Handbook. In brief, priority customers cannot be disconnected, while vulnerable customers are protected over winter months from 1 November to 31 March each year. Additionally, under the supplier led voluntary Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them at any time.

The Programme for Government commits to 7% average annual emissions reduction to 2030; ultimately, the goal is for a zero-emission mobility system by 2050. Electrification will be key to achieving this objective in the transport sector.<\/p>  <p>  Electric vehicles (EVs) are the most prominent transport mitigation measure in the  Climate Action Plan and Ireland has set an ambitious target of 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030. This target is challenging but indicates the scale of the transformation that is needed across all sectors if Ireland is to achieve its climate targets in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The Department supports the uptake of eSPSVs through the  Electric Small Public Service Vehicle (eSPSV) Grant Scheme. A grant of up to &euro;10,000 to support the purchase of a BEV in the taxi\/hackney\/limousine sector with an additional &euro;2,500 available for those choosing to make their vehicle wheelchair accessible. Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric. The Scheme is funded by the Department and administered by NTA acting as agents of the Department with delegated authority and as the licensing authority for SPSVs. &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support SPSVs to switch to electric.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, to promote the decarbonisation of the heavy-duty sector, and to assist road transport companies to transition from fossil fuels, the Department launched a new Alternatively-Fuelled Heavy-Duty Vehicle (AFHDV) Purchase Grant Scheme in 2021. The Scheme supports the purchase of new large vans, trucks, buses and coaches.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme, which is administered by TII, is intended to help bridge some of the difference in purchase price between conventional heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) and those powered by alternatively-fuelled power-trains that offer environmental benefits over standard diesel vehicle technologies, and that would not otherwise have been bought.<\/p>  <p>  To accord with EU State Aid rules, grant levels under the Scheme are calculated as a percentage of the difference in price between a conventionally-fuelled diesel HDV and its alternatively-fuelled equivalent. Maximum grant levels for eligible vehicles depend on the size of the company or enterprise applying for the grant, and on the fuel-type of the vehicle that the applicant wishes to buy.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;3m was allocated to this scheme in 2021 and given the excellent response to the initiative, a further &euro;3m was allocated this year.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department convened the Electric Vehicle Policy Pathway (EVPP) Working Group to produce a roadmap to achieving the 2030 EV target. This Group considered a variety of regulatory, financial, and taxation policies to accelerate EV adoption and recommended that the generous suite of EV supports already in place in Ireland should be retained until at least end-2022. Additional measures to further incentivise EVs and\/or disincentivise fossil fuelled vehicles will also be necessary. Cost-effective, targeted policy supports should continue to be developed and strengthened over the coming years. <\/p>  <p>  An Implementation Group has been established to progress the recommendations and consider further potential measures to drive the adoption of the EVs. This Group will report on its progress to Government in Q4 of this year.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, work is underway to establish Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland as a matter of priority. This office will co-ordinate the implementation of existing and future EV measures and infrastructure.  Our objective is to develop and refine cost-effective, targeted policy supports over the coming years.  <\/p>  <p>  Innovations that provide reliable solutions for people willing to transition to electric vehicles are to be welcomed, particularly if they provide options for people who might be unable to purchase a new vehicle. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Transport","counter":461,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL00500"},{"type":"question","counter":462,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[23987\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department plans to revise the current public service vehicle licensing scheme to allow operators to lease large public service vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":182,"qnumall":"[23988\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department will change the public service vehicle requirements in order to facilitate commercial bus operators to make the transition to electric vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.<\/p><p>The need to review and reform the Large Public Service Vehicle (LPSV) licensing regime is recognised by my Department.

This ensures that their weekly payment from the DSP is paid gross to the recipient, while their weekly\/monthly occupational pension paid by their pension provider will have any tax due on the DSP income and on the occupational pension deducted from it.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it is important to point out that if a person is aged 65 or over, they may avail of the annual age exemption limits. Section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA 1997) provides for these exemptions and associated marginal relief. Where the age exemption applies the claimant&rsquo;s income will be exempt from income tax in that year.<\/p>  <p>  The age exemption applies for any year of assessment where an individual is aged 65 years or over and his or her total income does not exceed &euro;18,000. Where an individual is a married person or civil partner and is jointly assessed to tax, the age exemption will apply where either individual is aged 65 or over and where the couple&rsquo;s total income does not exceed &euro;36,000. The relevant income thresholds may be increased further if the individual has a qualifying child. The thresholds are increased by &euro;575 in respect of both the first and second child, and &euro;830 in respect of each subsequent child.<\/p>  <p>  Marginal relief may be available where the individual&rsquo;s or couple&rsquo;s income exceeds the relevant exemption limit but is less than twice that amount. Where marginal relief applies the individual or couple is taxed at 40% on all income above the exemption limit to a ceiling of twice the exemption limit.  Once the income exceeds twice the exemption limit marginal relief is no longer available and the individual pays tax under the normal tax system.  It should be noted, however, that where the individual&rsquo;s income is greater than the exemption limit but below twice that limit, the taxpayer is always given the benefit of the more favourable treatment as between the use of marginal relief or the normal tax system of credits and bands.   <\/p>  <p>  I am aware that, depending on a person&rsquo;s circumstances, increases in weekly DSP payments may result in higher tax deductions from a person&rsquo;s occupational pension and a reduced weekly\/monthly net occupational pension.  However, over the course of a year as a result of the increased payment, a person&rsquo;s combined net income from their occupational and State pensions after the increase will always be higher than it was before the increase.    <\/p>  <p>  For clarity, Budget 2022 included an increase of &euro;5 per week in the State Pension and &euro;3 per week increase in the Living Alone Allowance. In general, an increase of &euro;8 per week in DSP income would mean an increase of approximately &euro;1.60 per week in tax deducted from a weekly occupational pension (the same weekly increase of &euro;8 would be &euro;32 per month and would result in an additional &euro;6.40 per month being deducted from the occupational pension).<\/p>  <p>  However, Budget 2022 included a significant tax package amounting to a cost of &euro;520 million. This included a substantial income tax package comprising of an increase of &euro;50 in each of the main tax credits &ndash; personal tax credit, employee tax credit and the earned income credit &ndash; from &euro;1,650 to &euro;1,700.  An increase of &euro;1,500 in the income tax standard rate band for all income earners was also introduced. Further details can be located at the following link - www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/7e491-taxation-measures\/.    <\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the fiscal demands and pressures facing the State in 2022, it would not have been possible to increase all tax credits and reliefs and remain within the fiscal parameters. However, it is worth pointing out that the age exemption limits are at a level which compares favourably with the tax treatment of the generality of taxpayers.      <\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that they have communicated directly with the Deputy in relation to the taxpayer in question on this matter.    <\/p>  <p>  I am further advised by Revenue that on review of the records of the person concerned, they are paying less tax on their private pension in the current year than in 2021. This is due to the combination of the increased DSP payments announced in Budget 2022 and the increased personal and PAYE tax credits for 2022, which reduce the amount of tax the person is due to pay on their income.  The tax deducted from their private pension in 2022 is currently &euro;6.62 per month as opposed to &euro;8.02 per month, as was the case in the latter half of 2021. Taking the increase in the DSP pension and the reduction of tax from the private pension into consideration, the taxpayer&rsquo;s net monthly income has increased in 2022.     <\/p>  <p>Additional guidance on a range of other tax credits and reliefs, such as the age tax credit,  that may be available for individuals over 65 years of age can be found in Tax and Duty Manual Part 15-01-26, which can be located at the following link &ndash; Tax and Duty Manual: www.revenue.ie\/en\/tax-professionals\/tdm\/income-tax-capital-gains-tax-corporation-tax\/part-15\/15-01-26.pdf.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":473,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL01700"},{"type":"question","counter":474,"qnumday":186,"qnumall":"[24044\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200073#WRL01800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has plans to increase the funding available for disabled drivers for the purchase of a new car; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1492","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":475,"content":"<p>The Disabled Drivers &amp;amp; Disabled Passengers Scheme provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.

In order to protect the integrity of the Irish passport and also the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are correctly completed and verified by the Passport Service by calling the Garda station to confirm the Garda's signature.<\/p>  <p>  It is stated in a note to the witness on the identity and consent forms that they may be contacted to confirm the validity of their signature. It is the responsibility of the witnessing Garda to ensure that the signature is correctly recorded in the logbook, so that when the Passport Service calls at a later date the signature can be verified.<\/p>  <p>  There are a small number of cases where the Passport Service has difficulty contacting a Garda station in order to verify the Garda's signature. Whilst the Passport Service makes every effort to contact the Garda station in these cases, unfortunately, the passport application may be delayed. In some cases, the applicant may be requested to submit a new witnessed form where the Passport Service has been unable to contact the Garda station. The Passport Service will only request a new witness form after multiple attempts have been made to contact the Garda station. <\/p>  <p>  A new document management system that was put in place at the beginning of March is ensuring that these applications which require further documents are being turned around within 15 working days of receipt of the additional documents.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the experience of the Passport Service that failure to contact Garda stations to verify witnesses is a widespread issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is continuously looking at ways to make the application process easier for applicants and advises during the online application process to make sure that the identity and consent form is correctly witnessed once they have completed the online process. <\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service provides instructions on how to correctly complete these forms on the Department's website (www.dfa.ie\/passports\/how-to-get-your-application-witnessed\/).<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service is also working on public education materials, including video tutorials, with a view to assisting applicants to complete their application correctly. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to this, the Passport Service maintains a close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and regularly offers training and guidance to Garda&iacute; on the correct completion of the required identity and consent forms.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service published a full-page informational advertisement in the April and May editions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s magazine, the Garda Review, to assist Garda&iacute; with the process of witnessing passport identity and consent forms. This advertisement includes the information that Passport Service will ring the Garda station to verify all first time passport applicants&rsquo; consent form details.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport very seriously. The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance. The Irish passport was recently ranked 5th in the Henley Global Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.<\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to amend the process for the witnessing of identity and consent forms by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200074#WRM03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":538,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[24023\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200074#WRM03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of first-time passport applications currently being processed.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":539,"qnumday":210,"qnumall":"[24024\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200074#WRM04000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of first-time passport applications that are incomplete, requiring further action from the applicant.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":540,"qnumday":211,"qnumall":"[24025\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200074#WRM04100","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of incomplete passport applications that require further action from the applicant that are as a result of witnesses being uncontactable.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":541,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 209 to 211, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 88,000 first time online passport applications in the Passport Service system.

Ireland is a strong proponent of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security and of the UN. It is essential, therefore, that Ireland remains fully engaged in all CSDP processes and contributes fully to the development of the policy in order that we can influence its evolution. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is engaged with a number of European Union defence-related initiatives and frameworks, including the European Defence Agency (EDA), the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD), the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen), the European Defence Fund (EDF) and the European Peace Facility (EPF).<\/p>  <p>  The European Defence Agency was set up in 2004 during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU and Ireland joined the Agency in July of that year.  The EDA is an Agency of the European Union, which supports Member States to develop a range of capabilities and capability standards to support CSDP, in particular the deployment of military capabilities in support of Crisis Management Tasks, as outlined in the Treaty on European Union. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Agency provides access to research and information on developing and maintaining professional capabilities and research that we cannot self-generate.  This is important in terms of Ireland's ability to participate in UN-mandated Peacekeeping Operations.  Ireland contributes, on an annual basis, to the operational budget of the EDA.  <\/p>  <p>  In May 2017, the Council endorsed the modalities to establish the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD).  This is a process which aims to create greater transparency by sharing Member States information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment.  All 27 EU Member States, including Ireland, participate and contribute to the CARD process. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland joined the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in 2017.  The establishment of PESCO represents a further development in EU Cooperation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Under PESCO, Member States come together in different groups to develop and make available additional capabilities and enablers for peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  Ireland is currently participating in one PESCO project and is an observer on a further nine projects.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has participated in The EU Satellite Centre (EU SatCen) since 2007. The EU SatCen is an Agency working for the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union under the Political Supervision of the Political and Security Committee and the Operational Direction of the High Representative, which is governed by a Council Joint Action. In the international security and defence field, it handles sensitive and classified data to support CSDP military operations and civilian missions.  The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs contribute to the budget of the EU SatCen.      <\/p>  <p>  The European Defence Fund (EDF) is an industrial sectoral programme, providing funding for research and capability development, which supports the European Defence and Industrial Technology Base in delivering capabilities for Common Security Defence Policy operations. The fund is designed to foster innovation to address new security and defence challenges and allow economies of scale through greater industrial and research cooperation and enhancing the competitiveness of the EU defence industry. The EDF is funded within the Multi-annual Financial Framework which itself is funded directly by the Exchequer.  Member State contributions to the EU Budget (Own Resources) are currently calculated annually by the EU Commission in line with the provisions outlined in Own Resources Decision (ORD) Regulation. As Ireland&rsquo;s contributions go into the general pool of revenue that funds all EU budget expenditure, including the EDF, there is no defined cost to the Exchequer for the EDF.       <\/p>  <p>  Ireland contributes to the funding of common costs for EU military crisis management operations through the European Peace Facility (EPF). The EPF, established in March 2021, replaced the Athena Mechanism and the African Peace Facility. Under the EPF, the Department of Defence has responsibility for the financing of common costs relating to EU military operations under the EU's common security and defence policy (CSDP). The Department of Foreign Affairs has responsibility for the funding of African peace support operations, previously handled by the African Peace Facility, as well as Assistance Measures in order to provide assistance to individual countries and regional or sub-regional organisations.  In 2020, the European Council agreed a &euro;5bn financial ceiling for the EPF over the seven years of the 2021-2027 MFF. Actual spending of EPF funds require separate unanimous Council Decisions for each operation or assistance measure, such as the recent examples of the EPF Assistance Measures in support of Ukraine. An annual ceiling for each of the seven years is set out in the Council Decision establishing the EPF.

The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the National Development Plan of &euro;566m over the 2022-2025 timeframe. Within that capital allocation the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141m. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  The Equipment Development Plan (EDP) published in June 2020, completed through extensive joint civil-military work, provides a comprehensive list of planned equipment projects which will be progressed over five years. This plan builds on the intentions set out in the White Paper in relation to equipment acquisition, modernisation and upgrade and has been developed to ensure that our Defence Forces have the major equipment platforms, ancillary equipment and force protection equipment to carry out their important roles both at home and overseas. The current position regarding the major equipment platform projects is as follows.<\/p>  <p>  The Equipment Planning process recognises the need to maintain and upgrade military capabilities having regard to emerging operational requirements and changes in technology and this is an ongoing process. <\/p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade of the Army&rsquo;s fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles is well underway and is due to be completed by 2023. In addition, orders for an additional 30 Armoured Utility Vehicles (AUVs) are nearing completion with the final 4 due for delivery during 2022. These vehicles will more than double the existing fleet and will provide a level of protected mobility between the levels of soft-skinned light transport and heavier armoured vehicles. <\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet.  In 2019, a contract was signed with Toyota Ireland for the replacement of the Army's fleet of 3\/4 tonne 4X4 vehicles.  To date 210 vehicles have been delivered with the remaining 70 expected in 2022. In March 2020, a tender process was completed for the supply of one hundred and twenty (120) new 4X4 Troop Carrying Vehicles, with 60 delivered to date. A further 30 are scheduled to be delivered in 2022 and all 120 vehicles concluding by 2023. A scheduled vehicle replacement programme is also currently underway for the replacement of 22 heavy logistics vehicles between 2022 and 2025.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above mentioned major capital programmes, the entire Defence Forces fleet undergoes ongoing review and replacement as required. As a result, an additional 120 vehicles of varying types will be delivered in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to air-based capability, my immediate priorities have been the acquisition of three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role and to acquire two Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft.  An additional PC-12 was also acquired in 2020 in response to the Covid 19 situation. <\/p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft was signed with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  Some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all of these enhanced capabilities, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023. <\/p>  <p>  The Naval Service Vessel Renewal and Replacement Programme is ongoing, this programme includes radar and other equipment upgrades along with the replacement of Naval Service Reserve motor launches. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n has been completed, while works are ongoing on L&Eacute; Niamh. Marine Advisors have been appointed to support the procurement of multi-role vessel to replace the flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, with work underway that will inform a public tender competition in due course.

The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority role. <\/p>  <p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area. <\/p>  <p>  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces retains a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for a natural disaster or terrorist incidents. The Operations Directorate in Defence Forces Headquarters manages the necessary cross-service coordination in responding to both emergency and security issues. These arrangements have proved effective in all emergencies encountered to date.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to security threats, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP), which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  <\/p>  <p>  There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies. Regular coordination and liaison meetings take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. <\/p>  <p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment is available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise. Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. The role of the Defence Forces in these situations is dependent on the nature of the incident and the type of assistance requested. <\/p>  <p>  The Defence Forces Alert System provides joint and coherent direction regarding responses to any potential national threat. This system ensures a quick, uniform and appropriate response to situations and enables the response to be phased, or brought to maximum effect as required. The readiness of Army, Air Corps and Naval Service personnel and assets are scalable in terms of size and timeliness, and can be adjusted to suit specific threats or situations.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review. It is my priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles both at home and overseas. <\/p>  <p>  There is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake, and likely risks. This is the work that the Commission on the Defence Forces were requested to undertake. The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces was published in February 2022. It is a substantial report running to over 180 pages and 69 main recommendations many of which have sub recommendations.  It recommends significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.<\/p>  <p>  The Commission's report is being fully considered, in consultation with Ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders.

It also acknowledges and harnesses the diversity of languages spoken in Irish primary schools.  It supports the introduction of modern foreign languages in senior classes, incrementally building on children&rsquo;s existing knowledge and awareness of language and progressing competency. <\/p>  <p>  The initial plan was for the consultation to take place between January and June of 2020. However, the impact of Covid required changes to be made with the data gathering ultimately taking place over two phases between February 2020 and March 2022. The data from the consultation is currently being analysed and will be reported on in the coming months. The Department will consider this report when available later in 2022.  <\/p>  <p>  Last year I invited expressions of interest from English-medium and Irish-medium primary and special schools to participate in a new language sampler module. The &lsquo;Say Yes to Languages&rsquo; sampler module allows schools identify a modern foreign language of their choice, or Irish Sign Language (ISL).  Schools are supported by Post-Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) in providing a six-week sampler module across a range of additional languages including Irish Sign Language (ISL).<\/p>  <p>  This six-week sampler module is targeted at pupils in 3rd to 6th class for up to 1 hour per week within the normal school timetable. It is open to schools to participate on a voluntary basis. Schools will have the autonomy to determine the language they wish to introduce to the children and to secure a language tutor e.g. language teacher\/language assistant from a post-primary school \/a member of the school\/wider community who is fluent in the target language.  <\/p>  <p>  PPLI have developed the module content in consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE). PPLI also provide a short online training programme for the language tutors identified by each school. There is additional training for schools management and class teachers who are hosting the module, should they wish to access it.  Delivery of the sampler module could be online or by way of a blended approach. PPLI are providing advice on sourcing language tutors\/teachers.<\/p>  <p>  There was huge interest in the sampler module with 470 schools and some 40,000 pupils participating in the scheme in 2021\/22 and 12 different languages have been selected including:  French, German, Irish Sign Language, Spanish, Italian, Mandarin Chinese, Lithuanian, Romanian, Polish, Portuguese, Arabic and Tamil.  A grant of up to &euro;1,000 has been provided to each participating school.<\/p>  <p>  The module  has now been extended for a second year 2022\/23 and is currently open for applications from primary schools until May 25.  Details of the scheme are outlined in Circular 0028\/2022: www.gov.ie\/en\/circular\/88a1a-say-yes-to-languages-language-sampler-module-202223\/.  The module will be extended to 8 weeks in 2022\/23 and the grant will be increased to &euro;400 per classroom up to a maximum of &euro;1,600.<\/p>  <p>  The sampler module aims to: <\/p>  <p>  - Generate awareness among pupils of the range of languages used by their peers, including Irish Sign Language, in their schools and communities which may help support greater inclusion and appreciation of diversity in society<\/p>  <p>  - Encourage uptake of  languages at post-primary level <\/p>  <p>  - Provide opportunities for increased levels of collaboration among the school community with regard to the celebration of languages and cultures<\/p>  <p>  - Support implementation of Languages Connect, Ireland&rsquo;s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017 &ndash; 2026. <\/p>  <p>  The sampler module will also inform future developments in the area of language acquisition and development of the Primary Curriculum Framework. I would encourage primary and special schools to explore this opportunity to take part in this new module.<\/p>  <p>  Language classes may also be provided by primary schools through extra-curricular classes which are organised locally by schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200076#WRO03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":608,"qnumday":235,"qnumall":"[23658\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200076#WRO03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of the development of new specifications for the relationships and sexuality education and social, personal and health education curricular across primary and post-primary schools; if upskilling programmes are available for teachers; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":609,"content":"<p>Access to Relationships and Sexuality Education, or RSE, is an important right for students.

The Strategy will continue to work towards ensuring that learners have the opportunity to develop their digital skills so that they can navigate the digital world in a confident and competent manner and that their voices are heard and taken into account in further developments in this area.  <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year I  established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying. This Steering Committee is chaired externally by Dr. Noel Purdy of Stranmillis University College in Antrim. This review involves significant consultation and collaboration across my Department, with other Government Departments and Bodies including the Ombudsman for Children, and also involves consultation with a broad range of education stakeholders, including parents and students, school management bodies and teacher and school staff unions. <\/p>  <p>  The review will take account of the significant developments and relevant research since the action plan was published in 2013. It will specifically consider cyber bullying, identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas. <\/p>  <p>  The review will also give detailed consideration to the recommendations contained in the Oireachtas Joint Committee Report on School Bullying and the Impact on Mental Health which was published last August. <\/p>  <p>  The Steering Committee consists of senior officials from the Department of Education, including the Inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service, representatives of the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU), the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU and other external experts and representatives of advocacy organisations which include BelongTo, Webwise, Parentline National Traveller Women&rsquo;s Forum, Women&rsquo;s Aid and the Independent Living Movement Ireland. The Steering Committee has held five meetings to date.  <\/p>  <p>  The Anti-bullying procedures for Primary and Post Primary Schools will also be reviewed and updated in parallel with this work. A working group comprised of representatives from each of the relevant management bodies and teacher and school staff unions, along with representatives from the National Parents&rsquo; Council Primary, National Parents&rsquo; Council Post-Primary, Irish Second Level Students&rsquo; Union (ISSU) and the National Anti-bullying Research Centre in DCU has been established to review the anti-bullying procedures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200076#WRO03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying of Children","counter":613,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200076#WRO03700"},{"type":"question","counter":614,"qnumday":237,"qnumall":"[23664\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200076#WRO03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress that has been made on the development of a new action plan on bullying; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1516","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":615,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, in February of this year I established a Steering Committee to review the 2013 Action Plan on Bullying.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose.  Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  <\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's projections of post primary school place requirements in Lucan show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short- to medium-term. <\/p>  <p>  However, in response to projected future need and to enrolment pressures in the area, my Department currently has 3 major projects underway for schools in this School Planning Area as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - St. Joseph&rsquo;s College Lucan &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is extension\/refurbishment to cater for 1,000 pupils (current enrolment of 904 pupils in 2021\/22)<\/p>  <p>  - Lucan Community College &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is extension\/refurbishment to cater for 1,000 pupils (current enrolment of 926 pupils in 2021\/22)<\/p>  <p>  - Griffeen Community College &ndash; project at stage 2b &ndash; project is new school for 1,000 pupils. There has also been additional interim accommodation approved for this school for 2022\/23 (current enrolment of 286 pupils in 2021\/22)<\/p>  <p>  While my Department is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional school places in Lucan, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors:<\/p>  <p>  - Duplication of applications &ndash; pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area<\/p>  <p>  - School of choice &ndash; pupils can&rsquo;t get a place in  their preferred school while there are places in other schools in the town\/area<\/p>  <p>  - Some towns\/areas have single sex schools and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils<\/p>  <p>  - External draw &ndash; pupils coming from outside the local area<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities. In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, my Department is engaging with patron bodies, including patrons of schools in Lucan, to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate further action to that already in train including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that principals of schools in the area have had a number of meetings to establish an overall picture of school place requirements for the next academic year.  My Department will continue to have close engagement with the relevant school patrons and authorities in order to monitor the situation and implement any solutions which may be required.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, my Department will continue to work to advance the planned and current projects in Lucan and to ensure sufficient places for both mainstream provision and for pupils with special education requirements both for the coming academic year and into the future.<\/p>  <p>   It is the responsibility of my  Department  to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  Parents can choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted.<\/p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to draft, publish and implement a school admission policy in accordance with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018. In schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in their school of first choice. <\/p>  <p>  The admission policy, including the selection criterion to be used where the school is oversubscribed, must comply with the Education Acts 1998 to 2018, be non-discriminatory and be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<\/p>  <p>  Where a board of management make a decision to refuse admission, a parent\/guardian can appeal that decision under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, and an independent appeals committee will be appointed to consider the appeal. The role of the section 29 hearing committee is to examine the application for enrolment and consider if it was correctly processed by the school, in accordance with the school&rsquo;s Enrolment Policy. The section 29 appeals committee cannot consider matters that are not provided for within the school&rsquo;s Enrolment policy. If a parent\/guardian considers that a school has erred in their processing of an enrolment application, a section 29 appeal committee can examine how the  application was processed by the school and identify if the school did not follow its Enrolment policy.  In cases where an error occurred the section 29 appeal committee will consider if the error had a material effect on the application. Where an error had a material effect on an enrolment application, the section 29 appeal committee can direct the school to enrol the student or adjust the students ranking on the waiting list.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a student, except in circumstances where an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 has been allowed and the appeals committee directs that the school admit the child concerned. <\/p>  <p>  A section 29 appeal must be made no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that if refused admission is due to the school being oversubscribed, and the parent\/guardian wishes to appeal this decision they must first make a written request to the school seeking a review of the board of management&rsquo;s decision.  This request for a review to the board of management is time bound and must be made within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.<\/p>  <p>  If refused admission is for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed, a parent\/guardian may, but are not required to, request a review by the board of management within 21 calendar days from the date of the decision by the school to refuse admission to the child.  Where a parent\/guardian has been refused admission for a reason other than the school being oversubscribed and chooses not  to seek a review by the board of management they may make an appeal to an independent appeals committee no later than 63 calendar days from the date of the school&rsquo;s decision to refuse admission.<\/p>  <p>  Full details on the section 29 appeals process for refused enrolment are available on the Gov.ie website at the links below:<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/8248c-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-due-to-a-school-being-oversubscribed\/<\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/31c4f-appeals-in-relation-to-refusal-to-admit-a-student-for-a-reason-other-than-the-school-being-oversubscribed\/<\/p>  <p>   In addition, Tusla Education Support Services (TESS) the Educational Welfare Service  is the legal body which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school placement for their child.

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.<\/p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.<\/p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.<\/p>  <p>  Participation in the scheme is voluntary and is therefore a matter for the Board of Management of a school whether or not it will participate in the programme in any given year. Furthermore, the Department cannot compel schools to participate in the programme. <\/p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[23967\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the HP Index data that is used in relation to the social context criteria for the special education teaching hours allocation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>As outlined in Circulars 20\/2022 and 21\/2022, the data which is being used to update the disadvantage component of the school profiles is the same data which has been used for the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) Identification Model. <\/p><p>This data is the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Small Area data, as represented in the Haase Pratschke Index of Deprivation (HP Index). <\/p><p>The key data source for primary schools is the Primary Online Database (POD) and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas, which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. <\/p><p>This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. <\/p><p>The use of the HP Index in the context of educational disadvantage is consistent with its use in the DEIS identification process and also its use across a range of Government Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":633,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[23968\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason that a school (details supplied) was refused special education teaching hours given that it has DEIS school status; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1595","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":634,"content":"<p>The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p><p>Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. <\/p><p>The SET allocation model has been in place since 2017.The allocation model, which was recommended by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), is designed to distribute the total available number of Special Education Teachers across primary and post primary schools based on the relative need of each school, as evidenced by a number of key indicators.<s><\/s><\/p><p>Special Education Teachers provide additional teaching support for students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes in primary and post primary schools.<\/p><p>The SET model is a fairer and more transparent way of allocating teaching resources to schools. <\/p><p>The number of teaching posts to support the SET model continues to increase. Budget 2022 provided an additional 620 new SET posts for allocation to primary and post primary schools in 2022\/23.  This will bring the total number of SETs in the system to 14,385. <\/p><p>The SET Model represented a significant shift in the way that students with SEN are supported in mainstream classes.  Previously, students needing additional teaching support required a diagnosis in order to access support which caused delays in providing the support and also imposed a burden on both schools and parents. The change in policy was welcomed by both schools and parents. The Model is based on the principle that those students with the greatest need receive the most support.<\/p><p>The model encourages schools to support students with SEN in mainstream classes alongside their peers.  In fact most students with SEN are enrolled these classes. This approach is also consistent with the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>When the SET model was introduced it was designed to be updated on a regular basis so as to distribute the total available resources across the school system based on profiled need. Because the level of student need may change in a school over time, some schools will gain under this distribution, with these gains balanced by equivalent reductions in schools where the model indicates reduced need. Re-profiling is the means of ensuring that new or increasing need in schools is met by transfer\/redistribution of teaching resources from other schools whose need has reduced as shown by the model.<\/p><p>Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p><p>Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p><p>Accordingly, a number of review processes have been put in place to support schools.<\/p><p>A process is in place to address circumstances where the school profile significantly changed following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increased.<\/p><p>The criteria for qualification for mainstream school developing school posts are set out in the Primary and Post Primary School Staffing Schedule for the 2022\/23 school year.<\/p><p>Schools who qualify for additional mainstream developing school posts in accordance with these criteria also qualify for additional Special Education Teaching Allocations to take account of this developing status. <\/p><p>It is also acknowledged that there are some circumstances, which may arise in schools, which fall outside the allocations for developing school status. <\/p><p>These relate to exceptional or emergency circumstances which could not have been anticipated e.g. where the school profile changes very significantly, or where other exceptional circumstances have arisen in a school and which may require a review of schools capacity to provide additional teaching support for all pupils who need it in the school, or of their utilisation of their allocations.<\/p><p>A process is available where schools can seek a review of their allocations by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), including the utilisation of their allocations, in circumstances where a school considers that very exceptional circumstances have arisen subsequent to the development of the profile. <\/p><p>If a school wishes to make an exceptional needs review appeal they may do so at the following link: ncse.ie\/for-schools<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01400"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[23991\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding additional accommodation for a school (details supplied) considering that the funding was approved in September 2019; when the works will proceed to e-tender; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1500","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>In relation to my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme 2019, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school to which he refers has been approved by my Department to proceed to Tender Stage.  <\/p><p>A letter has issued to the school authority in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":638,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01700"},{"type":"question","counter":639,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[24015\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP01800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of applicants from the post-primary schools in the fee-charging sector that applied for the post-primary schools Covid-19 minor works grant; the number that were successful in securing funding; the amount of funding that was provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":640,"content":"<p>As part of additional support in the context of COVID-19 a once-off COVID-19 minor works funding totalling &euro;17m issued to all eligible Post Primary schools in the free scheme during December 2021.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. The updated guidance for schools is also fully in line with the most recent guidance on non-healthcare building ventilation during COVID-19, published by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre November 2021. <\/p>  <p>  To provide additional support in the context of Covid-19 the payment of a minor works grant totalling &euro;45m for primary schools and special schools, plus a once-off Covid-19 minor works funding of &euro;17m for post-primary schools, was issued in December 2021. All recognised schools in the free scheme have received their grants and had the discretion to use the grant to meet their needs.<\/p>  <p>  Given that each school setting is different, individual schools are best placed to decide how best to use this funding to address their particular needs. Specialist advice\/assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect is an important source of support for schools.  This will help ensure that appropriate solutions are being put in place to address ventilation issues including advice on whether a HEPA Air Cleaner Unit is required to deal with a poorly ventilated room.  There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. <\/p>  <p>  Air cleaning devices are not a substitute for good ventilation but can be considered pending the completion of interventions\/works where poor ventilation persists. This is line with the Expert Group recommendations. Air filtration does not negate the need for natural ventilation and opening windows as required. Furthermore Mike Ryan of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Health Emergencies Programme has advised that schools not rely solely on air filters.<\/p>  <p>  In the case where a school has difficulty engaging a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect the Department can assist, with a dedicated ventilation team  available to support school principals in this regard.  Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements where the minor work grant does not cover the full cost of the works required.<\/p>  <p>  Outside of the minor works grant funding to date 27 schools have applied for additional funding under the emergency works scheme to assist with ventilation.

In 2021 nearly 38,000 children availed of the summer programme, an increase of 60% from the previous year.<\/p>  <p>  While, it is critically important to support a summer based programme in our special schools and special classes, it is also essential to ensure that the children with complex special educational needs (SEN) who are in our mainstream settings also have access to this critical support.  At the time when the &lsquo;July Provision&rsquo; was established, the concert of learning loss during school holidays was something which may have been considered to impact only those students in special schools and special classes. As our system has become more inclusive and many of these children with more complex needs now attend mainstream settings, it is recognised that they too will be impacted by school holidays and require that additional support to ensure they achieve their potential.<\/p>  <p>  A key objective of this year&rsquo;s scheme is to increase the number of schools offering the summer programme to their students. Steps have been taken to afford schools as much flexibility as possible, and to ease administrative requirements. This year there is provision to recruit newly qualified teachers graduating this summer as well as undergraduate student teachers who have registered with the Teaching Council under Route 5.<\/p>  <p>  To support and facilitate schools and principals with organising and running the programme, the 2022 Summer Programme allows principals to delegate these functions to other members of staff through the Overseer role and preparation hours. The Overseer and preparation roles provide an exciting personal opportunity for teachers to develop their leadership skills and experience with recognition at a whole-school level.<\/p>  <p>  Enhanced measures have been put in place to encourage participation of schools. These include:<\/p>  <p>  - A Centralised Application Process to reduce the administrative burden on schools.<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  - Provision to recruit final year student teachers graduating this summer and Route 5 undergraduate student teachers.<\/p>  <p>  - Guidance, information and support provided to schools to help design and deliver the programmes.<\/p>  <p>  - Capitation Grant Funding provided to cover the running costs of the scheme, including enhanced capitation for special schools and classes.<\/p>  <p>  This year, for the first time, there will be an online claims system for schools to submit payments details for those staff taking part in the school based summer programme. This will provide for faster and more streamlined payments to staff.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, with the assistance of the National Association of Management Boards in Special Schools (NAMBSE), the Department and Inspectorate recently hosted a webinar for Special Schools and provided a presentation on the supports and benefits of running a school based summer programme. The presentation focused on the positive outcomes for students that participated in the 2021 programme.<\/p>  <p>  While the number of special schools and classes taking part has risen over the last 2 years, we want to continue this growth in participation further. The Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to support parents in accessing summer provision and with schools to ensure that they have the resources and supports necessary to successfully run these programmes. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that not all schools will be in a position to provide a school-based programme, so a home-based programme continues to be available for students with complex needs where the school-based programme is unavailable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP02900"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[24065\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200077#WRP03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress that has been made to date in relation to the three schools project in Celbridge, County Kildare; if full agreement has been reached with Kildare County Council in relation to traffic management and road and bridge realignment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>The project to which the Deputy refers has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects. <\/p><p>A letter was issued by the Department on the 18th February 2022 to advise that the school in question had been included in the programme.

When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE has additionally provided my Department with projections of future requirements for classes for students with special education requirements. These are informing my Department's advance planning for special class accommodation.<\/p>  <p>  This advance planning is building on the significant work to date in delivering additional classrooms for students with special education needs.  Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects, unless local circumstances indicate that they will not be required. Typically, two classrooms for pupils with special education needs are provided in new primary schools and four classrooms are provided in new 1,000 pupil post primary schools, with pro-rata provision for schools of other sizes.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme. The main elements of this pipeline currently involve in excess of 1,300 school building projects for delivery under the Department&rsquo;s Large Scale and Additional Accommodation Scheme. These projects are currently in progress across the various stages of planning, design, tender and construction. Most of these projects are expected to be either under construction or completed in the period up to 2025 and are being progressed as quickly as possible. There are currently in excess of 250 school building projects at construction (on site) with a continuous stream of other projects at or near the tendering stage.  It is anticipated that 150 to 200 school building projects will be completed annually during the 2022 to 2025 period.<\/p>  <p>  The current status of approved projects is listed on a county by county basis on www.gov.ie and is updated on a monthly basis to reflect their progress through the various stages. <\/p>  <p>  The Special Education Teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.<\/p>  <p>  Under the allocation model, schools have been provided with a total allocation for special education needs support based on their school profile. <\/p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation is designed to give a fair allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the level of need in each school. <\/p>  <p>  Schools are front-loaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile. The allocations to schools include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. <\/p>  <p>  Both the Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to ensuring that all schools are treated equally and fairly in the manner in which their school profiles have been calculated.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.

Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements. <\/p>  <p>  Having considered the projected requirements, my Department then makes an assessment of the existing school accommodation capacity within that particular area and its ability to meet any increased demand.  A national inventory of school capacity, which utilises information from schools&rsquo; annual returns, is maintained by my Department and is supplemented by data on enrolment trends at individual schools as well as other indicators of potential capacity.  My Department&rsquo;s GIS is a critical tool in assessing such data in support of strategic planning for school accommodation needs.  The GIS facilitates the geospatial analysis of capacity relative to school place demand and the customised reporting of data at local, regional and national levels. <\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, at primary level national enrolments peaked in 2018 and are projected to decline by over 120,000 by 2033, as outlined in my Department&rsquo;s statistical report of November 2021: &ldquo;Projections of full-time enrolment Primary and Second Level 2021-2040&rdquo;.  In that same report it can be seen that post primary enrolments are forecast to peak in 2024 and then decline thereafter to 2039, by circa 90,000 places.  Although these projections do not account for arriving Ukrainian students, it is clear that at a national level there will be increasing levels of capacity within our existing schools infrastructure.  While local and regional variations will, of course, be relevant, the use of such capacity - to meet the needs of Ukrainian children in the first instance - will be an important element in my Department&rsquo;s strategic planning for capital investment in our schools. In this regard, a capacity survey at post-primary level has indicated available capacity of the order of 20,000 school places.  There is also very good capacity at primary level given the downward trend in demographics and this will be analysed at an individual school and town\/area level when a capacity survey of special schools and primary schools is undertaken at end May\/early June 2022.    <\/p>  <p>  Where the geospatial assessment of demand and capacity in an area indicates that additional provision is required my Department considers the options of extending the capacity of a school or schools, or of providing a new school or schools.  The timing and duration of the accommodation need is also considered in determining the optimum accommodation solution &ndash; for example a short-term accommodation requirement does not require a long-term accommodation solution. <\/p>  <p>  Separately, where a school considers that it has a requirement for additional mainstream or special education needs accommodation it is open to the school authority to apply under my Department&rsquo;s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) scheme.  The assessment of such applications is also informed by a geospatial analysis of demand and capacity in the relevant area, and a consideration of the timing and duration of the need.  The level of capacity in an individual school or in neighbouring schools is relevant when decisions on enrolment are being made.  It is important that capacity across a town or area is fully utilised before additional accommodation is approved.  <\/p>  <p>  While the main focus of resources over the last decade has been on provision of additional capacity to cater for increasing demographics, under Project Ireland 2040 there will be an increasing focus on the upgrade and refurbishment of the existing school stock. My Department is at the forefront of design with respect to sustainable energy in school buildings and this performance has been recognised at both National and International level with sustainable energy awards for excellence in Design and Specification. My Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency and they are based on solid energy research projects. Schools that are designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with current schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. The deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands.  The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives.

 It is important to note that entitlement to these supports is generally not contingent on the nature of the illness or disability but on the extent to which a particular illness or disability impairs or restricts a person&rsquo;s capacity to work. Budgetary provision is not made in respect of any individual illness or disease.  <\/p>  <p>  In March 2020, under the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 (No. 1) and subsequent regulations, the Government provided for entitlement to Illness Benefit for persons who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or who are a probable source of infection with Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has liaised with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to these emergency provisions, which require a Government Order for continued effect.  <\/p>  <p>  The rate of payment of the enhanced Illness Benefit payment in respect of Covid-19 is higher than the normal maximum personal rate of illness benefit, for a limited period.  The enhanced rate is &euro;350 per week, with additional payments in respect of dependent adults and children. <\/p>  <p>  Expenditure on this payment amounted to almost &euro;57 million in the period March to December 2020 and to &euro;106 million in 2021.  Expenditure in 2022, to end-April, was over &euro;141 million.  <\/p>  <p>  The enhanced rate is  payable for a maximum of ten weeks for those diagnosed with Covid-19.  In a case where a person continues to be ill beyond 10 weeks, standard Illness Benefit may be paid for an extended period, based on the person&rsquo;s continued eligibility.  Illness Benefit is the primary income support payment for people who are unable to attend work due to illness of any type and who are covered by Pay Related Social Insurance contributions.

In the means test, both schemes have an income disregard of &euro;140 per week. In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;350 are also disregarded, i.e., 50% of earnings in this band are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Earnings above &euro;350 are assessed in full.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 measures, will see from June:<\/p>  <p>  - An increase in the upper disregard of &euro;25 per week, from &euro;350 to &euro;375 for both payments<\/p>  <p>  - An increase of &euro;5.10 being applied to the general weekly means disregard entry point for the Disability Allowance. This increase will bring the entry point of the weekly means disregard for Disability Allowance in line with that of the Blind Pension, at &euro;7.60 per week.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of scholarships, such as those awarded by certain charitable organisations, which are not assessed as part of the means test for any social welfare payment.  These include payments under the 1916 Bursary Fund and under Higher Educational Scholarships for Adult Learners from Uversity, to a maximum of &euro;7,000 per annum.  Uversity is a registered charity that has been awarding Higher Education Scholarships to adult learners since 2018.  In addition disregards were introduced for persons in receipt of the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension who have been granted a bursary, stipend or scholarship towards completing a PhD in 2021\/22. <\/p>  <p>  Legislation does not provide for a disregard for funding from grants for artists and as such, any awards made through these types of schemes are assessed as income in the means test.  <\/p>  <p>  Any proposed changes to the means test for schemes, would need to be considered in an overall budgetary and policy context.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the age at which a person becomes eligible, there are a number of other differences between the Disability Allowance and Blind Pension schemes, for example, relating to aspects of the means test, taxation, access to the Free Travel Scheme and eligibility for concurrent payments.  <\/p>  <p>  With regards to capital in the assessment of means, my Department uses a formula, which is set out in legislation, to calculate a person's weekly means from capital.  For Blind Pension, and most other social assistance schemes, the formula is as follows: the first &euro;20,000 is fully disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.  The capital assessment formula applying to Disability Allowance is unique in the social welfare system, in that the first &euro;50,000 is fully disregarded; the next &euro;10,000 assessed at &euro;1 per thousand, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per thousand, with the remainder assessed at &euro;4 per thousand.

In determining the shortest most direct route, the relevant awarding authority shall establish:<\/p>  <p>   -  the method for measuring a route;<\/p>  <p>   -  the factors to be taken into account in establishing and measuring a route. <\/p>  <p>  The qualifying distance criterion for students to qualify for the non-adjacent rate of grant has been reduced from 45km to 30km, effective from the start of the 2022\/23 academic year.<\/p>  <p>  I have prioritised these changes for the 2022\/23 academic year and they will benefit thousands of students building on the improvements that have already been made and have been a priority for me since taking up my Ministerial appointment.<\/p>  <p>  This Department also provides funding for the Student Assistance Fund (SAF). The fund is available in various publicly funded higher education institutions. The SAF provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending third level. Students can be assisted towards their rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. <\/p>  <p>  The SAF is open to both full and part-time registered students on courses of not less than one year's duration leading to an undergraduate or postgraduate qualification.  Further details of the fund is available from the Access Office in the higher education institution attended.

Public hospitals will be supported by the NTPF in a number of different ways, including funding the operation of cataract clinics in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital and in Nenagh General Hospital. While the NTPF will seek to arrange over 150 different types of procedures in public and private hospitals, covering the full range of complexity on the waiting lists, there will be a particular focus on 15 procedures which, prior to NTPF engagement, accounted for more than 50% of the inpatient\/day case waiting list.

In following the Expert Group&rsquo;s advice, a person&rsquo;s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  However, every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

It is tough to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks which the above front-line workers faced. In recognition of the efforts of all workers, volunteers, and the general public during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in remembrance of people who lost their lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government announced a public holiday which took place on 18 March 2022. From February next year there will also be a new permanent public holiday established to mark Imbolc\/St Brigid&rsquo;s Day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Services","counter":929,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04100"},{"type":"question","counter":930,"qnumday":343,"qnumall":"[24029\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a child (details supplied) will receive an appointment with the children&rsquo;s disability network team in County Donegal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1463","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":931,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ambulance Service","counter":932,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04400"},{"type":"question","counter":933,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[24034\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that medical card holders who are resident in nursing homes are being denied their right to a public ambulance to transport them to either outpatient or inpatient hospital appointments and that families are being presented with accumulating bills from private ambulance providers.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":934,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[24035\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason that private ambulances are being utilised by nursing homes for the transport of medical card holders who cannot be transferred by wheelchair taxi to hospital in cases in which the national ambulance service or another ambulance service (details supplied) could provide this service either freely or for a nominal fee.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":935,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 345 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS), commonly referred to as Fair Deal, is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care. Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.<\/p>  <p>  The NHSS covers the cost of the standard components of long-term residential care which are: <\/p>  <p>  - Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person; <\/p>  <p>  - Bed and board; <\/p>  <p>  - Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of daily living; and <\/p>  <p>  - Laundry service.<\/p>  <p>  Costs not covered by the NHSS include those individually incurred for items like social activities, newspapers and hairdressing. This may also include medical services such as therapies and some medical equipment. A person's eligibility for other schemes, such as the medical card scheme or the drugs payment scheme, is unaffected by participation in the NHSS or residence in a nursing home.  In determining the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice. For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to state that residents of nursing homes should enjoy the same levels of support and access to services as when they lived in their own homes. It is acknowledged that the reason they require 24 hour levels of support is due to their level of dependency, which in turn may require access to clinical services including hospital and other outpatient appointments in the community. The HSE provides for a level of Intermediate Care Vehicles, which are used predominantly for non-emergency transport between acute hospitals for admission and discharge purposes. They would be reserved for those who would need specific support in transport. In other cases, normal transport arrangements apply. These arrangements (e.g. wheelchair taxi) are normally funded by the individual.<\/p>  <p>  Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home, as set out above. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income. The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200083#WRV04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":937,"content":"<p>Question No. 345 answered with Question No. 344.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":938,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200084#WRW00300"},{"type":"question","counter":939,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[24036\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200084#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of patients who are awaiting an appointment with a genetic counsellor in the department of clinical genetics, Crumlin Children&rsquo;s Hospital.","asker":"1495","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":940,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Within my Department, I have established a Rapid Response Team to actively monitor the impacts on agrifood supply chains and to contribute to the whole of Government response to this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I have also established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee, headed by Teagasc, to coordinate an industry response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs, and to develop contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises. While there are sufficient supplies of fertiliser and animal feed at present, price remains a concern.<\/p>  <p>  In March, the Government approved my proposal to support Irish farmers with a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multispecies sward initiative, worth over &euro;12 million. This package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser.<\/p>  <p>  Following discussions at EU level, including extensive engagement by EU Agriculture Ministers, the European Commission announced on 23rd March, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of measures to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers across the EU, in light of rising food prices and input costs. <\/p>  <p>  This includes an exceptional aid package to support impacted farming sectors, and I announced on 13th April that Ireland's allocation of &euro;15.8 million in exceptional EU funding would be deployed to support the pig and horticulture sectors.<\/p>  <p>  As you are aware the Government introduced a temporary reduction in excise duty on fuels, assistance on the price of electricity &amp;amp; gas, and a targeted and temporary grant scheme for hauliers, all of which will be of some assistance to farmers and the agrifood sector. On Marked Gas Oil (MGO) specifically, the Minister for Finance reduced the rate on MGO by 2c\/litre inclusive of VAT from 10th March. <\/p>  <p>  Effective from 1st May 2022 a further VAT inclusive 3 cent reduction for MGO will apply, bringing the overall rate of MOT to &euro;111.14 per 1,000 Litres.  This reduced rate fully offsets the 1st May 2022 increase in the carbon tax and will apply until 11th October 2022. While primary responsibility for taxation policy is with the Minister for Finance, I continue to work closely with him to ensure that the tax code reflects the Government&rsquo;s priorities for the agrifood sector and the economy generally.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this month, I brought a Memo for Information to Government on measures aimed to assist cattle and sheep farmers to produce fodder for next winter. <\/p>  <p>  The aim is to encourage farmers to grow more grass and conserve as much fodder (silage and\/or hay) during 2022 to prevent a fodder crisis during the coming winter and the impact that would have for animal welfare. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the detail of the scheme, and I will provide more detail on these measures in due course.<\/p>  <p>  I continue to engage with all our stakeholders and continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis, using all of the tools at our disposal. I believe we must support our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022051200085#WRX01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"}]
