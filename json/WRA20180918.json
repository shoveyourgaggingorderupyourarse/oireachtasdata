Standing still is not an option for the network.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres\u00a0on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.\u00a0An Post advises that\u00a0where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office. The reality is that by facilitating those who wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future.<\/p>  <p>  The agreement represents a\u00a0necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.\u00a0 Additional services that An Post propose to introduce through the network\u00a0include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities. Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it.<\/p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices.<\/p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there\u00a0will always\u00a0be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services.

Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out\u00a0a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions. The\u00a0pilot schemes are being currently rolled out in rural post offices.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;.

The annual report is available on the website of the Department of the Taoiseach. In relation to the Programme's commitments on climate change, the annual report records the publication of Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017, and first statutory National Adaptation Framework in January 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.\u00a0 The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low carbon economy by 2050.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In relation to our EU obligations, the 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) 406\/2009\/EC established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020. For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.\u00a0 The latest projections of greenhouse gas emissions, published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in May 2018, indicate that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by the ESD could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020.<\/p>  <p>  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.<\/p>  <p>  The ESD includes a number of flexibility mechanisms to enable Member States to meet their annual emissions targets. Using banked emissions allocations from the period to 2015, Ireland is projected to comply with its emissions reduction targets in each of the years 2013 to 2017. However, cumulative emissions are projected to exceed annual targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, which will result in a requirement to purchase additional allowances.\u00a0 While this purchasing requirement is not, at this stage, expected to be significant, further analysis is ongoing to quantify the likely costs involved, in light of the final amount and price of allowances required. <\/p>  <p>  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that \u00a0at\u00a0the absolute very least\u00a0we meet our 2030 target.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Plan is a living document that will be updated as on-going analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options. <\/p>  <p>  Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society. It will lead to a significant step change in funding available for climate action over the next decade. This funding commitment provides a clear opportunity for significant up-scaling in our investments to deliver deep emissions reductions in the coming decade and to further develop and implement the National Mitigation Plan and National Adaptation Framework. Reflecting the strong commitment of Government on this issue, almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.

Standing still is not an option for the network.<\/p>  <p>  In April this year An Post announced a renewed vision for the post office network which centres\u00a0on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network. The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members. In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the decision of\u00a0those who wish to leave the business is respected. These are\u00a0not decisions that have been taken lightly or without good reason. There are a number of reasons that postmasters\u00a0in Wexford, and around the country, are availing of this offer including age, low population levels as well as the fact that some postmasters are not even earning the minimum wage as a result of declining transaction\u00a0levels and mail volumes.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An Post advises\u00a0that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office. The reality is that by facilitating those that wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future. The agreement represents a\u00a0necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas. <\/p>  <p>  As part of its strategy for modernising the post office network, An Post has established a dedicated business unit within An Post, An Post Retail.\u00a0 Additional services that An Post proposes to introduce through the network\u00a0include a better range of Government services, financial services and e-commerce services for shoppers and small businesses. There is already a rapid expansion of banking services happening with the Smart Current Account and enhanced foreign exchange facilities. Post offices will have credit card services and will be able to provide loans to small business and personal loans. An Post is committed to ensuring that our post offices will be equipped with the range of services that will attract and retain footfall but these measures are meaningless unless the public use the services provided. Key to the survival of this renewed network is the willingness of all citizens to use it. <\/p>  <p>  Government business is the backbone of the network. In April this year the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection renewed her Department&rsquo;s contract with An Post to provide pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments at post offices. <\/p>  <p>  While Government policy is to offer Government services online, there will always\u00a0be a segment of the population that is not comfortable or proficient accessing online tools or services. The post office network is the obvious choice as the &ldquo;offline gateway&rdquo; for citizens with its nationwide network and existing strong relationship with offline citizens. Government funding of &euro;80,000 has been allocated to roll out a pilot scheme for Digital Assist which will see 10 post offices equipped to help citizens with online Government interactions.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, I have secured Government approval to explore how further services might be made available to our &ldquo;offline citizens&rdquo;. This would be delivered via a centralised procurement framework. A Working Group comprising representatives across Government Departments will be established to consider this issue and will report back to Government\u00a0by the end of year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fisheries Protection","counter":53,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB03800"},{"type":"question","counter":54,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[37620\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the progress made to date on a compensation package for eel fishermen.","asker":"1250","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":55,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP), including the closure of commercial fishing, was approved, in 2009, by the European Commission under EU Regulation 1100\/2007.

The policy focus is on the implementation of new renewable energy measures, such as the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH) to assist our efforts to accelerate the low carbon energy transition.<\/p>  <p>  Contingency planning has also commenced to explore\u00a0the potential\u00a0mechanisms and cost of addressing\u00a0our renewable energy targets within the framework of the\u00a0Directive. The Renewable Energy Directive makes explicit provision for\u00a0 countries to work together\u00a0 to enable targets to be met and one\u00a0mechanism involving statistical transfers allows Member States to reach their target by\u00a0purchasing credits from Member States that overachieve on their renewable targets to make up any\u00a0shortfall. Any purchases arising would\u00a0be made over a\u00a0number of years\u00a0and\u00a0the cumulative costs would not be known until\u00a02021. The Department is considering various Member States who may be in surplus and informal discussions\u00a0have taken place with a number of them. <\/p>  <p>  The 2014 Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP) sets out the Government&rsquo;s policy for the sustainable development of our abundant offshore renewable energy resources. Offshore renewable energy covers a number of technology types and includes wind (fixed and floating), wave and tidal, all of which rely on harnessing the motion of wind or water to generate energy.\u00a0 Of these technology types fixed offshore wind has reached the commercial stage, while floating wind, wave and tidal technology are still at the experimental stage globally. Floating wind has the potential to be deployed in deeper waters and as such could have potential for development off the south and west coasts of Ireland. Bottom fixed wind turbines are limited to relatively shallow waters. To date, Ireland has only one offshore fixed wind farm generating electricity in Irish waters. <\/p>  <p>  Between 2014 and 2017 capital funding of &euro;17.7 million was allocated by my Department under the OREDP for research and development of offshore renewable energy technology, with a further &euro;4.5 million allocated in 2018. Government funding supports Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to world class test facilities and infrastructure including the full-scale Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS), off the coast of Mayo.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition to Exchequer funding, the provision of a robust consenting regime, support scheme and development of an offshore grid policy are particularly pertinent in supporting our ambition for offshore renewable energy activities. <\/p>  <p>  The RESS was approved by Government in July and will now be subject to the EU state aid approval process. The first RESS auction will be held in 2019. The new Scheme has been designed to incentivise sufficient new renewable electricity generation to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the EU wide renewable energy target of 32% for 2030. Technology diversity, including solar PV and offshore wind, will occur naturally as the scheme matures and certain intervention levers may be used within each auction round to promote certain policy objectives such as community participation, community ownership and diversifying the renewable energy mix.<\/p>  <p>  Legislative proposals have been led by the Department of Housing Planning and Local Government to draft the Maritime Area and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill, including provisions\u00a0to address the absence of a regulatory framework to regulate offshore renewable energy developments beyond the limits of the foreshore (12 nautical miles). If we are to attract investment in the offshore renewable energy sector, it is critical that a robust, streamlined consenting regime is provided to regulate activities in the maritime area. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will also commence discussions later in the year to develop offshore grid connection policy in conjunction with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU)\u00a0and Eirgrid. The CRU have already published their Enduring Connection Policy (ECP) Phase I which takes into account shovel ready onshore projects. Phase II of the ECP is expected to include offshore applications for grid connections. Ireland is also a member of the North Seas Energy Cooperation Initiative at EU level. The key objective of this project is to enhance coordination and integration of national efforts of renewable deployment in addition to offshore grid planning. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s detailed policy measures and 2030 commitments on emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency will be set out in the upcoming first National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a draft of which is due in December 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Post Office Closures","counter":59,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB04400"},{"type":"question","counter":60,"qnumday":69,"qnumall":"[37614\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800054#WRB04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his plans to save the existing post office network in view of the recent closures of rural post offices and the plans for future closures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":61,"content":"<p>As Minister, I am responsible for the postal sector including the governance of An Post which is a commercial State company with a mandate to deliver a postal delivery service and a viable post office network.\u00a0I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and I am fully\u00a0committed to ensuring that a sustainable post office network is available to all our citizens for the medium and for the long term.<\/p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the post office network has been facing many challenges for some years now with a continuing decline in transaction numbers primarily driven by the move to online payments and online banking, as well as eSubstitution.

The latest projections from the EPA (published in May 2018) provide an updated assessment of Ireland&rsquo;s total projected greenhouse gas emissions out to 2030.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The EPA produced two scenarios when preparing the greenhouse gas emission projections, a With Existing Measures (WEM) scenario and a With Additional Measures (WAM) scenario. The WEM scenario assumes that no additional policies and measures, beyond those already in place by the end of 2016 (the year of the latest national greenhouse gas emission inventory), are implemented. The WAM scenario assumes implementation of the WEM scenario as well as further implementation of Government renewable and energy efficiency policies and measures, including those set out in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) and the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP).<\/p>  <p>  As per the latest EPA projections for the energy industries sector, projected emissions in the WAM scenario show an increase over the WEM scenario from 2020 to 2025. The Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy that supports peat being used for power generation ceases in December 2019 under the WEM scenario, and consequently peat used for power generation significantly reduces. Thereafter, the fuel type used for electricity generation is influenced by fuel price and in this case gas largely replaces peat in the power generation fuel mix leading to lower emissions. Emissions are higher in the WAM scenario based on the assumption that Ireland&rsquo;s peat power plants continue to operate with support for biomass provided for under the REFIT 3 scheme. This scheme includes the co-firing of peat and biomass for power generation which means more peat is used after 2019 to co-fire with biomass. The assumption of biomass co-firing with peat post 2020 is not included in the WEM scenario as the REFIT 3 decision for co-firing at the relevant peat power plants was made in April 2017 (after the 31 December 2016 cut-off point for policies and measures to be included in the WEM scenario).<\/p>  <p>  The use of peat for power generation will be progressively eliminated by 2030 by converting peat power stations to more sustainable low-carbon technologies. The Lough Ree and West Offaly plants will no longer receive support for their peat production under the PSO from the end of 2019. Both plants have been approved under the REFIT 3 scheme for PSO support for co-firing 30% of total capacity out to 2030, and it is expected that these plants will begin co firing on biomass in 2019. These two plants require the relevant planning permission to operate beyond 2019. The Edenderry plant has been approved for 30% co-firing support out to 2030, subject to renewal of planning permission. \u00a0Further increases in the percentage of biomass in the fuel mix of the peat stations is a commercial matter for Bord na Mona or ESB.<\/p>  <p>  The emissions from the three peat fired power plants are accounted for under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular. The projected shortfall to our targets is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself. In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU wide cost-effective basis.<\/p>  <p>  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030. Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction in 2005 levels of emissions by 2030. This is where we must now focus our efforts to ensure that, at the absolute very least, we meet our 2030 target. <\/p>  <p>  To meet these targets, Ireland's first statutory National Mitigation Plan, which I published in July last year, provides a framework to guide investment decisions by Government in domestic measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the Plan is to specify the policy measures required in order to manage Ireland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions at a level appropriate for making progress towards our long-term national transition objective as set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as well as to take into account existing EU and international obligations on the State in relation to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. <\/p>  <p>  This Plan very explicitly defined the scale of the challenge Ireland faces in decarbonising its economy and acknowledged that it was a first step and not a complete roadmap to achieve the national transition objective to 2050. Rather it began the process of development of medium- to long-term options to ensure that we are well positioned to take the necessary actions in the next and future decades. The Plan is a &lsquo;living document&rsquo; which is being implemented and updated on an on-going basis. <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, I am required, under the 2015 Act, to bring forward a new National Mitigation Plan at least once every five years. The latest date by which this must happen is, therefore, July 2022.\u00a0 I propose to initiate shortly the process of updating the current Plan in order to facilitate the detailed policy design required to realise the high-level of ambition articulated in the National Development Plan as well as to develop further cost-effective policy options to address Ireland's targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. This process will also be informed by Ireland&rsquo;s National Energy and Climate Plan, and by a new long-term low emissions strategy, both of which Ireland must prepare and finalise by the end of 2019 under the EU Clean Energy Package. I intend that the long-term strategy will further elaborate sectoral pathways for Ireland to meet its long-term decarbonisation objectives to 2050, as set out in the National Policy Position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800055#WRC01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Electricity Generation","counter":93,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800055#WRC01800"},{"type":"question","counter":94,"qnumday":82,"qnumall":"[37616\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800055#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"if his attention has been drawn to plans by Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB to generate electricity by use of large scale biomass and that such plans could result in the destruction of forests outside the State and lead to the generation of increased emissions of CO2; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1367","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":95,"content":"<p>As set out in the National Development Plan, the Government intends that, by 2030, peat and coal will no longer have a role in electricity generation in Ireland.

Prior to this, the power of appointment of State Solicitors had been vested in the Attorney General by Section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  State Solicitors are appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions under contracts for service and report to the Director and her senior staff. <\/p>  <p>  There are 32 State Solicitors areas.  Generally one State Solicitor is appointed to every county outside of Dublin.  Exceptions to this rule apply in Counties Cork, Galway, Kildare, Limerick and Tipperary.  In County Cork four State Solicitors have been appointed; one each for Cork City, Cork North East, Cork South East and Cork West.  In County Limerick two State Solicitors have been appointed; one for Limerick City and one for Limerick County.  Counties Galway, Kildare and Tipperary have all been divided into two State Solicitor areas.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin the Solicitors Division of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, headed by the Chief Prosecution Solicitor, provides a solicitor service to the Director.  The Division is staffed by solicitors directly employed by the Office and is responsible for the preparation and presentation of cases in the Dublin District and Circuit Courts, the Central Criminal Court and Special Criminal Court, the Court of Appeal and the High and Supreme Courts.  Outside the Dublin area the 32 local state solicitors provide a solicitor service in the Circuit Court and in some District Court matters in their respective local areas.<\/p>  <p>  When vacancies arise for State Solicitor positions they are advertised and following an open competition a contract is awarded for typically a 10 year period.  The contract awarded is a contract for service.  No oath is sworn on appointment; rather the obligations and duties of the State Solicitor are set out in their contract.  As the contract is not a contract of service (employment contract) the issue of full time or part time does not arise.  The contract places an obligation on the State Solicitor to discharge all of the criminal prosecution work in their area.  In larger areas such as Cork City and Limerick City because of the volume of work the State Solicitor will engage additional solicitor support to assist them in the discharge of their contractual obligations.  The contract allows the State Solicitor to engage in private practice subject to a range of restrictions.  <\/p>  <p>  There is no specific contractual prohibition on a State Solicitor acting as a contractor or subcontractor for a foreign State provided that the terms of any such contract or subcontract would not conflict with the terms of their contract as State Solicitor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800056#WRD00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1236"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","counter":113,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800056#WRD00700"},{"type":"question","counter":114,"qnumday":91,"qnumall":"[37540\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800056#WRD00800","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his meeting with Pope Francis.","asker":"1238","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":115,"content":"<p>I met with Pope Francis during his visit to Dublin Castle on Saturday 25th August.  <\/p><p>The meeting provided an opportunity for both of us to discuss a number of issues, though regrettably not in any great depth because of the short duration of the meeting. <\/p><p>I welcomed Pope Francis who thanked me for the warm welcome he had received on arrival.<\/p><p>We spoke of the legacy of pain and suffering caused by the failures of the Church and State in Ireland.

As detailed in the joint communiqu&eacute;, we discussed legacy issues, security cooperation, East-West matters, political stability, and future meetings of the BIIGC.<\/p><p>At the meeting, we reviewed the ongoing progress towards implementation of the Stormont House Agreement legacy framework and the legislative measures that are being brought forward in Ireland to implement and support this.  I also raised other legacy issues. <\/p><p>Both Governments recalled the commitments made in the 2015 Fresh Start Agreement to ending paramilitarism and looked forward to the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission.<\/p><p>On east-west relations, the conference committed to maintain the high levels of bilateral cooperation across a range of important policy areas and looked at where cooperation could be strengthened following the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU.  Officials have been tasked with taking forward this area of work with a view to drafting proposals for future east-west co-operation. <\/p><p>Both Governments reiterated our strong support for the Good Friday Agreement and reaffirmed our shared commitment to the political institutions it established.  We reaffirmed our joint commitment to securing the effective operation of power-sharing, devolved government in Northern Ireland, the resumption of the North\/South Ministerial Council and the participation of Northern Ireland in the British Irish Council at the earliest opportunity.<\/p><p>It was agreed at the conference that both Governments would meet again in the autumn.

Ireland has long been the OECD DAC, Development Assistance Committee, member which provides the greatest percentage of bilateral overseas development aid, ODA, to and through civil society organisations.  In 2016, the Irish percentage was 43%, compared to an OECD DAC average of 15%.  Indeed, in 2017, 51% of Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral ODA, over &euro;165 million was channelled to and through NGOs, an even higher percentage.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, prudential management of these Irish Aid funds is imperative to optimise the benefits for the poorest and most vulnerable and to ensure accountability to the taxpayer.  In particular, payments are dependent upon compliance with terms and conditions of grants, including receipt of satisfactory reports on previous funding and achievement of benchmarks.  My officials continue to engage actively with all NGOs in receipt of Irish Aid funding in relation to fulfilment of requirements for remaining payments this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has piloted a new grant management system across Irish Aid funds this year to ensure that programmes and projects funded by Irish Aid meet the increasing level of due diligence required both nationally and internationally.  Given the wide range of grant programmes which Irish Aid administers, it is not correct to generalise about the timing of grants to all NGOs.  Among due diligence requirements, grantees are required to maintain adequate levels of reserves and an appropriate level of dependency on Irish Aid.  Timing of grant disbursal is dependent on a number of factors, not all of which are predictable, including quality of input received from applicants, percentage of successful applicants meeting their benchmarks in a timely manner as well as internal capacity within Irish Aid. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800057#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Applications Administration","counter":198,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800057#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":199,"qnumday":123,"qnumall":"[37754\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800057#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the primary and secondary legislation which stipulates that a civil birth certificate is required for first passport applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[37755\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800057#WRE02400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if it is planned that SAFE level 2 shall be accepted as documentary evidence of both identity and citizenship replacing the need for applicants to submit civil birth certificates for the purpose of making a first-time passport application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.<\/p>  <p>  SAFE Level 2, SAFE2, registration is a process that allows a person to verify their identity for a number of public services provided by specified bodies.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Services Card and the relevant issuing process, which is managed by the Department of Social Protection, requires SAFE2 registration and verification.

The majority of these public servants currently have a compulsory retirement age of 65.<\/p>  <p>  Primary legislation is required for the new compulsory retirement age to be implemented and to that end, a Bill entitled the Public Service Superannuation (Age of Retirement) Bill 2018, was published on Monday 9 July and passed all stages in the Seanad on Tuesday 17 July.  The Bill is being treated as a priority and the intention is to secure enactment of the legislation as early as possible in the current term.<\/p>  <p>  The main provisions of the Bill are that:<\/p>  <p>  - The vast majority of public servants recruited prior to 1 April 2004 will have a new compulsory retirement age of 70;<\/p>  <p>  - Those public servants will continue to accrue retirement benefits up to the new compulsory retirement age of 70, subject to a maximum of 40 years' service;<\/p>  <p>  - The \"uniformed pension fast accrual\" group, i.e. Garda&iacute;, Firefighters, Prison Officers and the members of the Permanent Defence Force, will be unaffected by these changes.<\/p>  <p>  The new compulsory retirement age will not come into effect until the legislation is commenced.  In order to make some accommodation for public servants who reach the age of 65 in the period between the Government Decision of 5 December and the commencement of the necessary legislation, the Government approved some limited interim arrangements which became effective from the date of the Government Decision.  The interim arrangements (which have to respect the current statutory position of the compulsory retirement age of 65), through retire and re-hire, enable pre 2004 public servants who reach the age of 65 to remain in employment only until they reach the age of eligibility for the State Pension (Contributory), which is currently 66.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800058#WRF04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Staff Recruitment","counter":296,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800058#WRF05000"},{"type":"question","counter":297,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[37599\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800058#WRF05100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the areas of the public sector that are experiencing the most acute recruitment and retention problems; the measures he is taking to address these problems; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":298,"content":"<p>The subject of overall recruitment and retention issues in the public service was examined by the Public Service Pay Commission in their first report in May 2017.  After a comprehensive investigation, they found that \"In general, evidence suggests that there are not significant recruitment difficulties to the various large scale public service vocational streams.  However, there are problems in the case of some specific and specialist groups across the public service.\"<\/p>  <p>  This conclusion is supported by the strong growth in public service numbers since the ending of the Moratorium.  Between Q4 2013 and Q2 2018 the public service increased by 11% or over 35,000 staff from 288,217 to 322,868.  Included in these numbers are over 12,000 teachers, over 4,300 nurses, nearly 1,500 Garda&iacute; and almost 1,800 doctors and dentists.  Importantly, it should be understood that, this increase has been sufficient to replace all leavers (including retirements) from the public service while still growing overall numbers employed.<\/p>  <p>  As such the evidence suggests that the public service is a good employer offering competitive terms and conditions including flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.<\/p>  <p>  The second report of the Public Service Pay Commission, published on 4 September, went further and investigated recruitment and retention difficulties in some of the specific areas previously identified, starting with the health sector.  Where a difficulty was identified, the PSPC were to further examine the full range of causal factors, including, remuneration, planned future adjustments to remuneration under the PSSA, supply constraints on qualified staff, career structures, work environment, and HR practices etc.<\/p>  <p>  The main findings of the report were that there were no generalised recruitment and retention problems in respect of nursing and midwifery but some difficulties exist in meeting workforce requirements in specific areas, that training and promotion are the key influencers of migration and turnover in NCHDs and that there is a general difficulty in recruiting consultants, with certain specialities and locations experiencing more significant problems.<\/p>  <p>  There is a commitment between Public Service employers and staff representatives to meet within four weeks to discuss issues around implementation of recommendations outlined in the Report. Arrangements are being made for this engagement.<\/p>  <p>  Finally it is worth noting that the next report of the Public Service Pay Commission will explore recruitment and retention issues impacting on other grades and sectors of the Public Service, including the Defence Forces.

Arising from our two calls for apprenticeship proposals in 2015 and 2017 fourteen new apprenticeships have been developed in a wide range of sectors, including financial services, engineering, ICT, hospitality, logistics and accounting.  Further new apprenticeships across a wide variety of sectors including construction, engineering, horticulture and agriculture will get underway later in 2018 and throughout 2019.<\/p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, as the employment and economic situation continues to improve, we have seen strong growth in registrations across the craft trades nationally during 2017 with 4,508 at year end, which represents a 20% increase on 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This Government is also prioritising the expansion of traineeship offerings.

This applies to providers operating in the areas of further or higher education and training.  QQI is undertaking a re-engagement process with its legacy providers, the purpose of which is to renew this relationship and to ensure that providers have in place fit for purpose quality assurance arrangements that serve the needs of learners.  This is essential in order to ensure that all education and training activities meet appropriate quality standards and meet the learning objectives of participants.<\/p>  <p>  QQI, unlike other awarding bodies, does not provide programmes and related assessment methodologies to providers.  Instead, providers who engage with QQI must have their own capacity to design programmes and assessment methodologies based on awards standards set down by QQI and linked to the National Framework of Qualifications.  Through the process of re-engagement, legacy providers will have the opportunity to demonstrate that they have this capacity and equally importantly, that it is sustainable in the long-term.  This will help underpin the credibility and reputation of the education and training opportunities across the broader spectrum of the further education and training sector and contribute to the further development of the appropriate pathways through that system.  Important considerations that arise in that regard relate, for example, to the capacity that providers will be required to put in place to ensure that the infrastructure required to develop and deliver programmes are consistent with national standards and facilitate the assessment of the achievement of stated learning objectives by learners.<\/p>  <p>  QQI has worked closely with stakeholders from the Community and Voluntary Sector to identify appropriate solutions that balance the need to continue to facilitate this sector&rsquo;s education providers to support hard-to-reach learners, with the responsibility to ensure that all providers that engage with QQI are equipped to meet the same robust quality assurance standards.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy informing QQI's fee structure has been subject to extensive consultation and provides that the application of fees will be consistent, transparent and equitable.  It is also important that it reflects the amount and complexity of the work undertaken by QQI.  The level of fees to be applied for the purposes of re-engagement has been subject to extensive deliberation to ensure that they are consistent with this policy and are applied equitably.  It was determined during this process that it would not be possible to develop a fee waiver scheme which would be fair, equitable, objective and justifiable given the diversity of providers in this sector.

In the 2017\/18 school year over 117,000 children, including over 12,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 4,500 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres annually at a total cost of almost &euro;190 million in 2017.  <\/p>  <p>  There are 11 Bus &Eacute;ireann vehicles operating to various schools in County Louth and there are 145 Contractor&rsquo;s vehicles operating to various schools in County Louth.  <\/p>  <p>  In order to be considered roadworthy a bus must pass an annual Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness Test (CVRT), conducted under the auspices of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) at approved test centres around the country.  Bus &Eacute;ireann school transport providers are contractually obliged to ensure that their vehicle has an up to date roadworthiness certificate issued by an RSA accredited test centre when a contract is signed.  The contractor is obliged to keep their roadworthiness certificate current and up to date at all times and provide Bus &Eacute;ireann with evidence of this. <\/p>  <p>  All school buses in service - procured by Bus &Eacute;ireann to provide services under the School Transport Scheme - that are subject to roadside inspections, must have current roadworthiness certification at the time of inspection. <\/p>  <p>  A detailed contract is put in place for all contracted services &ndash; which includes numerous safety-related items.  There is a strict process in place before any vehicle or driver is added to the approved list for provision of services under the School Transport Scheme. Required documentation is checked and copies are held by Bus &Eacute;ireann offices.  This documentation includes insurance and insurance indemnity, valid Road Passenger Transport Operator Licence (with required vehicles added), valid Certificate of Roadworthiness (CRW), appropriate valid Public Service Vehicle licence (large\/small) (PSV) and evidence of Tax Clearance.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann contracts also include a stipulation that requires all contractors to have planned maintenance programmes, with checking intervals of not more than six weeks.  Every Contractor is also responsible as an individual bus operator, licensed by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, to ensure they comply with legislation in all respects.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to statutory requirements, Bus &Eacute;ireann arranges for additional sample auditing of contractors vehicles operating under the Scheme, throughout the year.  These additional quality assurance checks are carried out by independent vehicle inspection auditors, on both a targeted and random basis.  Almost one in five buses contracted to the School Transport Scheme are audited under these quality assurance checks, which are designed to monitor the condition and roadworthiness status of each vehicle checked. <\/p>  <p>  Any vehicles that fall short of the standards required during the audits are immediately withdrawn from further service until all identified issues are rectified by the contractor.  If contractors are found not to have carried out the required improvements to their fleet and systems, they face penalties up to and including termination of contract.<\/p>  <p>  Figures recently released to RT&Eacute; under FOI stated that 51% of the buses inspected by the RSA in the past year failed roadside safety checks.  Almost a third of them were found to have had major or dangerous defects.  It should be noted the figures do not exclusively pertain to operators contracted on the School Transport Scheme.  Many buses included in the figures were operating on privately engaged school services or other private hire work at the time of inspection.  The RSA have also acknowledged that the inspections were targeted at operators of known concern and the published figures reflect this.<\/p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann have robust requirements and checks in place to ensure a high level of safety at all times and in this regard they will be issuing a communication to TDs and Senators in the coming days to provide information on these safety requirements and checks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800060#WRH02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1351"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects Status","counter":423,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800060#WRH03100"},{"type":"question","counter":424,"qnumday":203,"qnumall":"[37381\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800060#WRH03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the position regarding the progress of a development at a school (details supplied) in County Cork.","asker":"1278","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":425,"content":"<p>The school building project referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rapid&rdquo; Design &amp;amp; Build programme.

They had ceased to exercise EU Treaty rights in the State in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations and Directive at that time.

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.<\/p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour. I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<\/p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society. For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities. In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and close to &euro;100 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.<\/p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone. Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding. These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general. We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan, which will see an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. Since 2014, approximately 2,200 new members have attested and been assigned to duties in communities throughout the country. By the end of this year it is expected Garda numbers will have increased to approximately 14,000 for the first time since 2011.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800064#WRM03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Expenditure","counter":717,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800064#WRM03500"},{"type":"question","counter":718,"qnumday":301,"qnumall":"[37490\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800064#WRM03600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the expenditure that has been incurred on Garda overtime in 2018 to the end of August; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":719,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the Garda Commissioner is the Accounting Officer for the Garda Vote and as such is responsible for the effective and efficient use of the resources at his disposal, in accordance with operational need.

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016-2021 is an ambitious 5-year programme, based on agreed Garda priorities, involving over &euro;60 million exchequer funding and benefitting over thirty locations around the country.

However, I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to take all forms of anti-social and drug-related behaviour very seriously.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continue to monitor all new and emerging crime trends in our communities and deploy Garda resources accordingly to address any problems that arise.<\/p>  <p>  Working with communities to tackle public disorder and reduce anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This approach includes a strong focus on quality of life issues and collaboration with local authorities to help address the causes of anti-social behaviour.  I might add that there is a range of strong legislative provisions available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat anti-social behaviour, including provisions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts, the Criminal Damage Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. There are also the incremental provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which provide, in Part 11, for warnings and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults and, in Part 13 of the Act, for warnings, good behaviour contracts and civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by children.<\/p>  <p>  Anti-social behaviour has no place in a civilised society.  For its part, the Government remains committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have all the necessary resources to tackle all forms of criminality in our communities.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that a very substantial budget of &euro;1.65 billion has been allocated to the Garda Vote for 2018 and close to &euro;100 million has been provided for Garda overtime for 2018, which inter alia supports Garda activity to tackle these types of problems.<\/p>  <p>  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to tackle these problems head-on, they cannot eradicate the problem of anti-social behaviour alone.  Specifically in relation to young offenders, it is also up to us as adults, particularly the parents and guardians of our young, to ensure that children are raised to be respectful and law-abiding.  These lessons begin in the home, are further reinforced in our schools and then by wider society in general.  We must all work together to ensure that such behaviour is never normalised and is tackled immediately. <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, Garda visibility is very important and this Government remains committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently undertaking a programme of accelerated recruitment, as part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened service through the Five Year High Level Reform and Workforce Plan, which will see an overall workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.

The first reported case of narcolepsy as a possible consequence of the Pandemrix vaccination was identified by the Swedish pharmacovigilance authority in August 2010.  The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), being the relevant regulatory authority for Pandemrix, continually monitored the reported adverse reactions of Pandemrix and advised member states accordingly.<\/p><p>It is important to remember the context in which vaccination against influenza type A (H1N1) was introduced.  On 11 June 2009, following consideration by its Emergency Committee, the WHO raised the Influenza type A (H1N1) alert to Pandemic level 6 which officially declares a pandemic.  In Ireland, children and young adults were the most affected groups.  Eighty percent of cases were less than 35 years of age.  More than 1,000 cases of confirmed Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza were hospitalised and 100 people were admitted to Intensive Care Units.  There were 29 deaths, all but two of which were in &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups and most had other significant underlying medical conditions.<\/p><p>The Department of Health activated the National Plan for Pandemic Influenza and, based on the advices of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee; &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; groups were prioritised for vaccination.  Vaccination of children was prioritised as the rates of influenza were highest in those groups at that time.  The public pandemic vaccination campaign ended on 31 March 2010.  Over 1.1 million pandemic vaccinations were recorded giving a 25% uptake for the total population.  Since the 2010\/2011 influenza season H1N1 has been incorporated in the seasonal flu vaccine used in Ireland.<\/p><p>A copy of the report can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>health.gov.ie\/blog\/publications\/final-report-of-the-national-narcolepsy-study-steering-committee-2\/<\/i>. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800066#WRO07300","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Motorised Transport Grant","counter":905,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800066#WRO07400"},{"type":"question","counter":906,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[36995\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800066#WRO07500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"his plans to reinstate the motorised transport grant for new applicants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":907,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant schemes in February 2013. <\/p>  <p>  My colleague, the Minister for Health and I brought a Memorandum to Government on proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme towards the end of the last D&aacute;il session.

Tobacco Free Ireland sets a target for Ireland to be tobacco free (i.e. with a prevalence rate of less than 5%) by 2025.   <\/p>  <p>  Tobacco Free Ireland contains a number of recommendations to assist smokers in quitting tobacco use.  One of those recommendations is to examine the evidence regarding the outcomes of the use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy ('NRT') and other approaches.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department requested HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment ('HTA') of the clinical and cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical smoking cessation products and services. The HTA was published in 2017 and found that all the pharmacological interventions were effective compared to no treatment and that a prescription only drug called varenicline was the most effective drug on its own. However, the HTA also found that using a combination of varenicline and NRT was the most effective pharmacological intervention and that people using this combination were over three and a half times more likely to quit than those who were in a control group and did not receive this treatment. <\/p>  <p>  Group behavioural therapy, individual counselling, intensive advice and telephone support were all found to be effective behavioural interventions with group therapy found to be the most effective of these interventions. The addition of a behavioural intervention to a pharmacological intervention improved the effectiveness of the intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The HTA recommended that smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of varenicline, either alone or in combination with NRT, for smokers who want to use a pharmacological support. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to e-cigarettes and vaping, although the HTA found that results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is currently a lack of evidence to recommend their use as a smoking cessation aid and at present no e-cigarette product is licensed as a medicinal product in Ireland. The safety of e-cigarettes is an evolving area of research; while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on its long-term safety has yet to be established.  In the absence of additional evidence confirming the effectiveness of e-cigarettes, the HTA recommended that the HSE smoking cessation services should seek to increase the uptake of combination NRT treatment among those for whom varenicline is contraindicated, not tolerated or not preferred.  <\/p>  <p>  The results of the HTA are informing the development by the HSE, in conjunction with the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee, of national clinical guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  Current evidence-based means of quitting include behavioural support and pharmacotherapies.  The HSE provides and promotes these safe and evidence-based services, supports and aids to help people to quit.  The HSE recommends that those wishing to give up smoking uses its cessation services as the first port of call.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the emerging research on all products, so as to inform decisions around any future additional regulation in this area. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800068#WRQ02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pharmacy Services","counter":1010,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800068#WRQ02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1011,"qnumday":399,"qnumall":"[37083\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800068#WRQ02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if changes which have recently been made by which pharmacy assistants can no longer cover for the senior pharmacist for a short period will be reviewed (details supplied); the rationale for this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1250","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1012,"content":"<p>The Pharmacy Act 2007 established the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) and the functions of the Society are set out in the Act.

The Strategy aims to improve dementia care to allow people with dementia to live well for as long as possible and have services and supports delivered as well as possible. A review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy was published in May this year and has identified what has been achieved so far and sets out further work required to further implement the Strategy. This work will feed into the estimates process for 2019 and subsequent years.<\/p>  <p>  In parallel with the Strategy, a National Dementia Strategy Implementation Programme (NDSIP) was agreed by the Department of Health, the HSE and Atlantic Philanthropies. &euro;27.5million was committed to the Programme over a three year period across a number of initiatives, including dementia specific intensive homecare packages, an education and training programme for GPs and Primary Care Teams, and an information and awareness campaign which seeks to challenge public misconceptions about dementia and the challenges facing people living with dementia.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the HSE&rsquo;s National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. The project did not look at the generic services that people with dementia or their families and carers may use or the quality of the identified services.  However, it provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these community supports, in 2014 the HSE introduced Dementia-Specific Intensive Homecare Packages (Dementia-IHCPs) to test the feasibility of providing a high level of support to people with dementia with complex needs to facilitate them to remain living at home. These were initially co-funded by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies and now fully funded by the HSE, which has committed to continue to provide approximately 120 packages at any one time. At the end of July, there were 171 active Dementia-IHCPs, while 361 people with dementia had availed of an IHCP. In addition to the IHCPs, people with dementia are also able to avail of standard home care services on the basis of need and within the resources available.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health secured &euro;6.26 million through the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans to develop a number of projects which are designed to expand public awareness of dementia and to improve care for people with dementia.

The Strategy contains 35 priority and additional actions and its implementation is being led by the National Dementia Office in the HSE. The office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Progress made to date and future plans, are recorded in the mid-term review of the Strategy's implementation, which was published in May this year.<\/p>  <p>  The Strategy&rsquo;s implementation was boosted at the time of its launch through a joint programme of investment by the HSE and the Atlantic Philanthropies. This &euro;27.5 million investment allowed for a number of key actions within the strategy to be resourced and implemented. It funded the PREPARED programme, which offers education and clinical resources for GPs and Primary Care Teams; intensive homecare packages for people with dementia; the Understand Together awareness campaign; and the establishment of the National Dementia Office, which has an important role in implementing the Strategy. The Office has made substantial progress towards developing evidence-based care pathways for people with dementia. Additional projects are being funded through &euro;6.26 million in Dormant Accounts funding secured by the Department of Health in the 2016, 2017 and 2018 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plans.<\/p>  <p>  In 2016 and 2017, the National Dementia Office partnered with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland on a project to map dementia-specific community-based services and supports. It provides a useful snapshot and baseline study into what, where and when dementia services are being offered. The study has also been used to inform a service finder hosted on the National Dementia Office&rsquo;s website. This allows people to search for dementia-specific community services in their area. There are gaps in access to services and a large variance in what services are provided across the country. The National Dementia Office has met with senior HSE officials in each Community Healthcare Organisation region to highlight gaps in each area and to develop local action plans to improve service provision.<\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Office has also developed a needs analysis framework to support local dementia service planning and development. This framework is a mechanism to help the Office direct time, energy and resources into dementia care that most appropriately meets the needs of people with dementia. It will be used to make dementia service development more responsive and consistent across the country. <\/p>  <p>  The National Dementia Strategy calls for the HSE to consider the provision of dementia advisers, based on the experience of demonstrator sites. In order to fully capture the experience of demonstrator sites and inform the future development of this service, the National Dementia Office commissioned an external evaluation of the service. The evaluation, by University College Cork, began in November 2017 and is expected to be finalised by September 2018. Initial results indicate that a majority of people with dementia are satisfied with the information, advice, support and signposting provided by dementia advisers. The service has brought normality to their lives, provided understanding about dementia and given people with dementia the confidence to ask questions. The appointment of additional dementia advisers will be considered when the results of this evaluation are available. <\/p>  <p>  A priority action in the National Dementia Strategy is the appointment of key workers to coordinate each patient's care and promote continuity, and ensure that the patient knows who to access for information and advice. It is proposed that the key worker will be responsible for the coordinated planning and delivery of individually tailored care plans, developed in consultation with the person, their family carers and a range of health and social care practitioners. The key worker will also provide expert knowledge and leadership in dementia. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health has secured funding through the 2018 Dormant Accounts Action Plan to continue funding in 2019 for the Dementia Community Activation Coordinator post which has been co-funded through a partnership between the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the HSE during 2018. The Community Activation Coordinator is working with national organisations and key community stakeholders to support community dementia champions across Ireland. The Coordinator will seek to grow the number of champions and people within communities to take action to create sustainable dementia inclusive communities.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the specific requests for funding referred to by the Deputy, the level of funding available for the Department of Health in 2019 and the quantum of services to be provided by the HSE will be considered as part of the national Estimates and budgetary process and National Service Planning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1177,"content":"<p>Question No. 457 answered with Question No. 369.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Data","counter":1178,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1179,"qnumday":458,"qnumall":"[37303\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of women that received mesh implants here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1180,"qnumday":459,"qnumall":"[37304\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the steps he is taking to address the concerns of women that had mesh implant procedures carried out here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1354","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1181,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 458 and 459 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Health I am committed to putting in place the measures necessary to ensure that both the current use of Transvaginal mesh implants (TVMIs) in surgical procedures in Ireland, and the ongoing clinical management of women who have had these procedures in the past are in line with international best practice and emerging evidence.  At my request, the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) is preparing a report which will make recommendations in relation to the clinical and technical issues involved.  I am informed that following policy actions in relation to mesh by health authorities in the NHS and in Northern Ireland in July 2018, as set out below, further engagements with the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Agency, the professional bodies and colleagues in other jurisdictions were needed for the purpose of finalising the report.  I am informed that the CMO&rsquo;s Report is anticipated to be completed in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Pending finalisation of the report, a number of significant system actions in relation to mesh implants have already been advanced.<\/p><p>The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the Health Service Executive on 20 July 2018 to request that the Executive put immediate measures in place to: <\/p><p>1.  Pause the use of all procedures involving uro-gynaecological\/transvaginal mesh implants for the management of Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) or Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) in HSE funded hospitals, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so. <\/p><p>2.  Ensure that in situations where expert clinical judgment is that there is an urgency to carry out the procedure and no suitable alternative exists, surgery should proceed only if a delay would risk harm to the patient and should be based on multidisciplinary team decision and fully informed consent.<\/p><p>This pause is to remain in place pending confirmation of implementation by the Health Service Executive, working in conjunction with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), of three urgent recommendations relating to:<\/p><p>(i) Surgical Training, <\/p><p>(ii) Informed Consent and <\/p><p>(iii) the Development of an agreed Dataset of Mesh Procedures.<\/p><p>The Department also wrote to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Continence Foundation of Ireland on requesting that they assist the HSE in progressing these recommendations on an urgent basis.<\/p><p>The HSE has published information for patients on its website concerning the pause.<\/p><p>It is acknowledged that there may be concerns that restricting the availability of mesh procedures, particularly SUI mesh procedures, which are widely accepted to be less invasive and more effective than non-mesh alternatives will delay access to treatment procedures for distressing symptoms. Advice received in relation to this is that uro-gynaecological mesh procedures are largely elective procedures and it is not anticipated that a postponement of weeks \/ months will materially affect health outcomes for the majority of women affected. Given the limited number of surgeons and units carrying out these procedures in HSE funded hospitals, it is anticipated that the Executive will be in a position to indicate to the Department that these recommendations have been implemented within a number of months.<\/p><p>The decision to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures in HSE funded hospitals followed a review by Department officials, together with representatives of the HSE and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), of the NHS England decision of Tuesday 10 July to institute a similar &lsquo;pause&rsquo; in their use. This decision in the NHS followed a recommendation by the Independent Medicines and Medical Devices Safety (IMMDS) Review established in February 2018 by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, the Rt. Hon Jeremy Hunt MP. On Wednesday July 11, a pause was instigated by health authorities in Northern Ireland. <\/p><p>It has been clarified by the NHS that there is no concurrent change in the evidence base concerning these devices. The recommendations of the IMMDS to NHS England arose because of a lack of certainty or confidence that critical clinical governance measures to assure the safety of mesh procedures are demonstrably in place. The Department considers that similar concerns in relation to the visibility and consistency of such measures apply equally in the public health system here.<\/p><p>There is understandable public and patient anxiety about the ongoing safety of mesh devices in light of the considerable publicity that this issue has received and this has been heightened by recent developments in the NHS. It is important that this be addressed as comprehensively as possible.  A pause on the use of mesh procedures, pending confirmation by the Executive that the recommendations as set out above have been implemented, is considered proportionate and necessary to provide public assurance that these procedures are being carried out in accordance with internationally accepted good practice. <\/p><p>The advice of the HPRA to the Department is that it is supports a temporary restriction on all procedures involving uro-gynaecological\/transvaginal mesh implants, pending the introduction of the further clinical mechanisms proposed relating to the delivery of care for patients. The regulatory status of uro-gynaecological mesh implants at a European level remains unchanged in that they are CE marked medical devices. As such, the benefit-risk profile for the devices is considered positive. Ensuring that the use of transvaginal mesh is appropriate and as safe as possible requires, not only that the device is safe and performs as intended, but also that the healthcare system has appropriate measures for patient selection, treatment and follow-up in place. <\/p><p>In relation to the provision of appropriate aftercare for women suffering from mesh complications, including appropriate diagnostic facilities, this has already been identified as one of two priority recommendations for immediate advancement by the Executive in the course of preparation of the CMO&rsquo;s report.  The CMO wrote to the Acting Director General of the HSE, and to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (IOG), the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), and the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) on May 28 2018,  requesting that the Executive commence work on (i) the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials and (ii) clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications, in conjunction with the IOG, the RCSI and the CFI.<\/p><p>The HSE has confirmed that work has commenced by the National Women and Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in the HSE to progress all of the recommendations above.  A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the NWIHP on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website.<\/p><p>The experiences of women concerned will be an essential element to informing the assessment of need and identifying the aftercare services required. I am informed that a Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations.<\/p><p>This work is ongoing and will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. It will also include an examination of the role of and requirement for specialist diagnostic services such as translabial scanning. The outcome of this work will clarify if there is a need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any shortfalls identified at national level, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad.<\/p><p>The information provided by the HSE is that approximately 700-800 procedures are carried out annually for pelvic organ prolapse repair and similar numbers of sling procedures for stress urinary incontinence are performed. However, the HSE Hospital In-patient Enquiry (HIPE) system does not record the numbers of these procedures that involve the implantation of a mesh device.<\/p><p>The HSE advice is that all patients who have experienced complications due to mesh devices are advised to contact their consultant&rsquo;s clinic in the first instance.  Each hospital group has nominated an individual to coordinate a response to this group of patients.  If patients are having trouble accessing information they can contact the National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme at <i>smi.nwihp@hse.ie for help.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Care Packages Funding","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":460,"qnumall":"[37309\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a situation in north County Dublin by which home care hours have been allocated and approved and carers are available and ready to do the work but the funding has not been approved;\u00a0if his attention has been further drawn to the fact that there are several persons waiting for funding to be approved in this manner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1261"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Children's Hospital Expenditure","counter":1185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05812"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":461,"qnumall":"[37310\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800070#WRS05825","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the original budgeted cost of building the national children's hospital; the cost incurred to date on the project; if it is in-budget when compared to the original budget; if not, the amount by which it overspent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1187,"content":"<p>As announced in April 2017, the budgeted capital cost of the design, build and equipment programme for which the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is responsible is &euro;983m, of which &euro;916m is Exchequer capital and &euro;67m is to be funded through commercial and philanthropy sources.

In this capacity, the Department of Health is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the many challenges resulting from Brexit. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health and its agencies including the HSE have been conducting detailed analysis on the impacts of Brexit in the area of health and intensive Brexit preparedness and contingency planning is underway. <\/p>  <p>  A key issue will be to ensure that there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis. Priorities include ensuring continuity in the supply of medicines and medical devices, ensuring access to services, manpower in our health services, continuation of existing cross border health co-operation and public health arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across the European Union is enormously helpful &ndash; to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry. Ensuring continuity in the supplies following the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU is a priority. The issue of customs is of relevance as it relates to additional food safety controls and medicines. The implications of Brexit for networks and organisations such as the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed are also under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  Contingency planning for a no-deal or worst-case outcome was identified as an early priority and is now well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate economic, regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern.<\/p>  <p>  This work has provided baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations. This is enabling the modelling of potential responses under different scenarios, such as one where a withdrawal agreement, including a transitional arrangement, is concluded and where a Free Trade Agreement is the basis for the future relationship between the EU and the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In line with this approach, the Government has already approved a number of key Brexit preparedness measures focused on East-West trade and has mandated the presentation to Government before the end of September of detailed and costed proposals on the staffing, IT, infrastructural and operational requirements for the implementation at ports and airports of the necessary customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary checks required as a result of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. In total 51 reports analysing the effects of Brexit across a broad range of sectors and in some cases setting out responses have been published to date by Government Departments. All these reports are available on a dedicated Brexit webpage at: dfat.ie\/brexit. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1374,"content":"<p>Question No. 531 answered with Question No. 465.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Staff Recruitment","counter":1375,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03300"},{"type":"question","counter":1376,"qnumday":532,"qnumall":"[37558\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the estimated cost in 2019 of recruiting 170 extra speech and language therapists and 100 additional occupational therapist posts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1377,"content":"<p>I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly on this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":1378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1379,"qnumday":533,"qnumall":"[37564\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800073#WRV03700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there are plans to reduce or completely remove the home help service provided by the HSE and to allow private companies to provide home help services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1283","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1380,"content":"<p>The Home Support Service is an increasingly important part of the supports for enabling older people to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and for facilitating their discharge from acute hospitals.

Commission Implementing Regulation 262\/2015 (CR 262\/2015), which came into effect on 1 January 2016, lays down the rules governing the identification of equidae.  This legislation was transposed into national legislation in Ireland via the European Union (Identification of Equidae) Regulations (S.I. 62 of 2016) (as amended).<\/p>  <p>  Article 12(1) of CR 262\/2015 provides that all equine animals must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the animal, and in any event, before moving permanently from the holding of origin.  The passport must generally accompany the equine on movement.<\/p>  <p>  Equines for which passports were issued with effect from 1st July 2009 must be implanted with a microchip by a veterinary practitioner and the number of that microchip must be recorded in the passport of the animal and on my Department's central equine database, thereby establishing a link between the animal and its identification document.  However, equines identified with a passport prior to that date are not required to be implanted with a microchip.  Accordingly, the absence of a microchip does not necessarily mean that an equine is not identified properly.<\/p>  <p>  Equine passports are issued by Passport Issuing Organisations (PIOs) approved by my Department.  Information available from these organisations suggest that high rates of compliance with the identification rules are being achieved.<\/p>  <p>  Enforcement of equine identification legislation is primarily undertaken by authorised officers in my Department and across the various Local Authorities, who liaise with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and officers of the Revenue Commissioners Officials, as required.  Authorised officers from my Department engage in checks at sales venues including marts and fairs, as well as at horse slaughter plants and at export points including ports and airports.  These compliance checks are ongoing and will continue to be undertaken.<\/p>  <p>  The presence of a microchip in an equine cannot be established visually.  When checking for the presence of a microchip in an equine, it is necessary to physically handle and scan the animal.  From a health and safety perspective, this action should only be undertaken by personnel who are competent in the handling of equines.  In that regard, where a member of  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na requires an equine to be scanned, s\/he should liaise with veterinary staff in the relevant Regional Veterinary Offices (RVO) of my Department who will assist in the scanning of the equine.

I am acutely conscious of the value placed by communities in both rural and urban areas on services provided by post offices and I am fully\u00a0committed to ensuring that a sustainable post office network is available to all our citizens for the medium and for the long term.  While I completely accept that the recent announcement of closures will have an impact on the communities\u00a0served,\u00a0it is important to be put the announcement of these closures into context.  <\/p>  <p>  It is widely accepted that the post office network has been facing many challenges for some years now with a continuing decline in transaction numbers primarily driven by the move to online payments and online banking, as well as eSubstitution.  Less than 2 years ago,\u00a0I was presented with a future for An Post and the post office network that was uncertain and extremely bleak.  The potential for a complete shutdown of postal services with the loss of thousands of jobs was undeniable.  Immediate action was needed and since then there has been significant work undertaken to restructure the company. <\/p>  <p>  As part of this process An Post announced, in April this\u00a0year,\u00a0a renewed vision for the post office network which centres\u00a0on the availability of new services in a modernised, revitalised network.  The announcement was supported by an agreement reached between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union (IPU) executive following months of intensive negotiations, and was subsequently endorsed by 80% of IPU members.  In its negotiations with An Post, Postmasters sought both the modernisation of the network and a voluntary redundancy package for those who wanted to leave the business.  An Post advises\u00a0that where a post office closes, 70% of the business transfers to a neighbouring office.  The reality is that by facilitating those that wish to exit the business, neighbouring offices are further supported thereby ensuring a more sustainable network for the future. <\/p>  <p>  The agreement represents a\u00a0necessary first step in reinvigorating our national post office network and making it a viable sustainable, modern and vibrant network for the future, capable of adapting to the changing environment in which it operates by providing a service that meets the needs of communities across the country, particularly in rural areas.<\/p>  <p>  An Post has done extensive\u00a0work combining business and demographic data with\u00a0local knowledge to produce a network plan which actively supports the future of rural Ireland.

The most recent data, for the year 2016, are available on the EPA's website at: <i>www.epa.ie\/pubs\/reports\/air\/airemissions\/ghgemissions2016\/#d.en.63244<\/i>. <\/p><p>According to this data, the breakdown of emissions by sector in 2016 is as follows: <table><tr><th>Sector<\/th><th>Mt CO2eq.<\/th><th>% of total 2016 emissions<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Agriculture<\/td><td>19.85<\/td><td>32.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Energy Industries<\/td><td>12.56 <\/td><td>20.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Transport<\/td><td>12.29<\/td><td>20%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Residential<\/td><td>6.05<\/td><td>9.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Manufacturing Combustion<\/td><td>4.55<\/td><td>7.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Industrial Processes<\/td><td>2.15 <\/td><td>3.5%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>F-Gases<\/td><td>1.27<\/td><td>2.1%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commercial Services<\/td><td>0.99<\/td><td>1.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waste<\/td><td>0.96<\/td><td>1.6%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Public Services<\/td><td>0.87<\/td><td>1.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total ETS<\/td><td>17.73<\/td><td>29%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total Non-ETS<\/td><td>43.81<\/td><td>71%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The 2009 Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) established binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for EU Member States for the period 2013 to 2020.  These targets concern emissions from most sectors not included in the EU ETS, such as transport, buildings, agriculture and waste.  For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20% below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD, and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  For 2030, the recently agreed EU Effort Sharing Regulation sets out binding annual greenhouse gas emission targets for each Member State for the period 2021 to 2030.  Ireland&rsquo;s target under this Regulation will be for a 30% reduction on 2005 levels of emissions by 2030.<\/p><p>The latest EPA report on greenhouse gas emissions projections, published in May 2018, indicates that Ireland complied with its annual emissions reduction targets limits in the period 2013 to 2015,\u00a0but exceeded its annual binding target for the first time in 2016.  The report indicates that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by Ireland's 2020 targets could be between 0% and 1% below 2005 levels by 2020, in the context of a target that emissions should be 20% below their 2005 levels.  While this is very disappointing, it is not surprising given the recent pace of economic growth, with increases in emissions from the agriculture and transport sectors in particular.<\/p><p>The projected shortfall to our target is further exacerbated by both the constrained investment capacity over the past decade due to the economic crisis, and the extremely challenging nature of the target itself.  In fact, it is now accepted that Ireland&rsquo;s 2020 target was not consistent with what would be achievable on an EU-wide cost-effective basis.  With this in mind it is crucial that the focus of our efforts must now be to ensure that we, at the absolute very least, meet our 2030 target. <\/p><p>As a means to addressing Ireland&rsquo;s emissions reduction challenge, I published Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory National Mitigation Plan in July 2017.  It has established the framework for the development and implementation of medium-to-long-term policy options so as to achieve progressive emissions reductions in each of its four key sectors with the most significant contribution to national emissions (Electricity Generation; the Built Environment; Transport; and Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use). <\/p><p>It is important to note that the National Mitigation Plan is a living document that will be updated as ongoing analysis, dialogue and technological innovation generate more and more cost-effective sectoral mitigation options.  This continuous review process reflects the broad and evolving nature of the sectoral challenges outlined in the Plan, coupled with the continued development and deployment of emerging low carbon and cost effective technologies across different sectors of the economy.  Such a process will be critical towards managing to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic activity. <\/p><p>Building on these strategies, the publication in February of the National Development Plan, reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s strong commitment to transitioning Ireland\u00a0to a low carbon, climate resilient economy and society.  Almost &euro;22 billion will be directed, between Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, to addressing the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient society.  In addition, the National Development Plan allocated a further &euro;8.6 billion for investments in sustainable mobility.  This means that well over &euro;1 in &euro;5 spent under the National Development Plan will be on climate mitigation and this capital investment will enable us to deliver a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions over the period to 2030, as well as\u00a0realising opportunities for sustainable economic growth. <\/p><p>To reflect the significant\u00a0policy developments since the National Mitigation Plan, in particular\u00a0with the publication of the National Development Plan, I\u00a0published an update on climate mitigation policy -<i>Investing in the Transition to a Low-Carbon and Climate-Resilient Society 2018-2027<\/i>, which coincided with the <i>Empowering Communities for Climate Action <\/i>event on 20 June and is available to download on the DCCAE website. <\/p><p>In terms of expenditure, both the National Mitigation Plan and the National Development Plan explicitly recognise that\u00a0reliance solely on Exchequer expenditure schemes is neither affordable nor adequate to the scale of the challenge to be addressed, and climate mitigation action will require a targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation measures, regulation and behavioural change.  In certain cases, taxation policy may have a stronger role to play in changing individual or business behaviour and investment decisions, including harnessing non-Exchequer finance. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":1673,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ04500"},{"type":"question","counter":1674,"qnumday":635,"qnumall":"[37866\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ04600","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the extent to which it is expected to use waste to energy in electricity generation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1675,"content":"<p>Latest data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)\u00a0 indicate that\u00a0waste to energy accounted for 1% of gross final electricity consumption in Ireland\u00a0in 2017, with a\u00a0 total of 78 MW installed generation capacity from the\u00a0municipal waste to energy plants in Co.

At its heart is a commitment to transform Ireland into a low carbon society and economy by 2050 and envisages a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the energy system by 80-95% relative to 1990 levels by 2050.  The White Paper identifies the importance of diversifying Ireland's energy generation portfolio and largely decarbonising the energy sector by 2050 but also recognises that some fossil fuels will remain significant elements of Ireland&rsquo;s energy supply in that transition period.  Furthermore, the National Mitigation Plan 2017\u00a0restates the Government's commitment to move from a fossil fuel based electricity system to a low carbon power system.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Overall, provisional SEAI analysis shows that 10.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s energy requirements in 2017 were met from renewable sources with renewable electricity generation accounting for 30.1% of electricity demand in the same period.  Given Ireland's baseline starting point\u00a0 in the reference year of 2005, when Ireland was in the bottom quartile of renewable energy in Europe, Ireland has made significant progress and is expected to achieve over\u00a080%\u00a0of its\u00a0renewable energy target by 2020.  The SEAI has also estimated that the contribution of renewables avoided &euro;276 million of fossil fuel imports in 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland aims to increase renewable energy in transport by increasing the use of sustainable biofuels and by the increased deployment of Electric Vehicles (EV).  An EV Grant Scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland\u00a0(SEAI), is in place to provide grant aid of up to &euro;5,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery EV or Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV).  A new grant to support the installation of home charger points for buyers of new and second-hand EVs is in place since January 2018.  Other significant initiatives to advance Ireland's level of renewable energy include\u00a0the new\u00a0Renewable Electricity Support Scheme\u00a0and the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.<\/p>  <p>  In June of this year the EU agreed an EU-wide binding\u00a0renewable energy target of 32% out to 2030 and Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this ambition will be informed by the development of Ireland&rsquo;s first integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), a draft of which will be submitted to the Commission in December. <\/p>  <p>  The agriculture sector has a key role to play in helping Ireland meet its renewable energy targets.  Bioenergy will be an important part in the renewable energy mix for Ireland and thus displacing fossil fuel usage.  The sector is a key supplier of bioenergy feedstock including forest thinnings and animal by-products such as residues from the meat processing industry, slurries and other agricultural by-products.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) currently offers funding under the Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme for planting fast growing species.  In addition, DAFM provides supports for farmers wishing to avail of Renewable Heat technologies in the form of supports for biomass boilers and air-source heat pumps.  Grant aid is also available for solar panels used for electricity production (photovoltaic) and water heating.  Energy efficient grants for the dairy sector are also being provided through the SEAI.<\/p>  <p>  In addition Bord Bia operates Origin Green, Ireland&rsquo;s national sustainability programme for the food and drink sector.  The Programme sets out meaningful and measurable sustainability goals which help the sector reduce their environmental impact and achieve efficiencies in the daily running of their businesses.  Complimentary programmes like these delivered across a number of Government Departments are crucial in delivering our climate and energy ambitions as laid out in the National Development Plan and Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","counter":1680,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ports Development","counter":1679,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1680,"qnumday":637,"qnumall":"[37015\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800077#WRZ05200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if there has been a financial investment through public funds in Rosslare port and harbour in the past five years.","asker":"1259","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1681,"content":"<p>Rosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts, but is instead operated as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann. <\/p><p>The planning and funding of infrastructural requirements is an operational matter for the port and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and the company has invested significant funds in the Port over the years.

This measure enhances the previous provision, and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years). This further expansion delivers on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. <\/p>  <p>  The practical provision of a second year of ECCE required either an increase in the upper age limit for ECCE, or a reduction in the lower age limit. The latter was chosen and is consistent with the law in this country with regard to school starting age and the associated policy of the Department of Education and Skills. This minimum age was chosen based on national experience and a review of international practice. It also had regard to the regulatory environment for early years care and education in this country and issues such as child development readiness and adult-child ratios. The upper age limit will remain the same (i.e. a child is not eligible if they reach the age of 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year).<\/p>  <p>  This new measure addresses the previous situation with three entry points (September, January and April) which gave rise to a significant fluctuation in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of (between 61 and 88 weeks depending on the date of birth of the child). A single entry point will ensure a programme that is equitable in terms of entitlement for all children and helps streamline the administration process, making it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year and making it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children. <\/p>  <p>  As with any large scheme at national level, clear rules are required to ensure transparency and objectivity in administration. It is a feature of administrative schemes that where cut off points relate to age and birth dates, the age parameters may not suit some applicants. In this regard it should be noted that parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child. A decision may be made to utilise only one year of the programme for various reasons.  For example, some parents of children born in the first quarter of the year, may prefer for their child to start school at 4 years of age rather than 5. These parents may therefore opt for 1 year of ECCE only. <\/p>  <p>  I accept that the use of age limits in a scheme such as this creates a situation whereby a child can fall just outside the age range. My Department has no immediate plans to revise the ECCE lower age limit beyond the changes already introduced in September 2018. A consideration of any future change would need to have regard to a wide range of issues as to what is in the best interests of all of the children participating in the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800079#WRBB05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Payments","counter":1829,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800079#WRBB05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1830,"qnumday":687,"qnumall":"[37371\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800079#WRBB05700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when the Tusla family services grant will be paid to an education centre (details supplied).","asker":"1248","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1831,"content":"<p>Tusla, the Child and Family Agency administers funding to support the provision of counselling services to vulnerable children and families.

The only limitation to retaining an OFP payment is an upper earnings threshold of &euro;425.  If earnings are below this threshold, the OFP recipient can work whatever number of hours suits the family circumstances, and the appropriate rate of OFP, relative to the earnings received, will be paid.<\/p>  <p>  Working Family Payment (WFP) may also be payable, where a minimum of 19 hours per week is worked.  Again, there is no upper limit on the hours worked, but an earnings threshold applies (this varies depending on the number of children in the household).  It is clear, therefore, that policy is aimed at supporting and encouraging work where this is a viable option for lone parents.<\/p>  <p>  Rent supplement plays a vital role in housing families and individuals, with the scheme supporting 27,400 recipients at a cost of &euro;180 million in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or income increase.  Income from employment and Working Family Payment (WFP) in excess of the standard Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) weekly rate of payment attracts an additional income disregard and the income is assessed as follows; the first &euro;75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes.  The standard weekly minimum rent contribution for a one parent family is &euro;30 with many recipients paying more than this amount due their assessable means (part-time work etc.), after the appropriate disregards, being above their appropriate SWA rate.<\/p>  <p>  This overarching policy concern of security of tenure is being addressed via the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP).  HAP has been designed to simplify the current system of housing supports, and it allows households that get full-time employment to remain in the new scheme (rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, i.e. for 30 hours or more a week).  Under HAP, a &lsquo;differential rent&rsquo; based on household weekly income is paid in the same way rents are charged to tenants in local authority housing.<\/p>  <p>  The strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support, and is being facilitated with the introduction of the HAP.  The transfer of long-term recipients of rent supplement to HAP is expected to be completed by 2020 in line with targets set out in Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800081#WRDD00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Supplement Scheme Eligibility","counter":1931,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800081#WRDD00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1932,"qnumday":721,"qnumall":"[37145\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800081#WRDD00600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the reason for the non-payment of rent support in June and July 2018 in the case of a person (details supplied); if payment will be reinstated at an early date and arrears paid with particular reference to the likelihood of the person becoming homeless in the absence of further assistance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1933,"content":"<p>The purpose of rent supplement is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation, where they are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.<\/p>  <p>  The person concerned was in receipt of rent supplement from 01\/11\/06 to 31\/5\/18 at the monthly rate of &euro;669.98, with a total of &euro;10,7301 paid to date.

The campaign was aimed at ensuring that there is better public awareness of the important service the Department provides in determining employment status and to help develop a better understanding of the scale and nature of false self-employment.  The main advertising campaign ran over a two week period, with digital and social media promotions continuing for a further two weeks.  The campaign directed people to a dedicated page on the Department&rsquo;s website as a first step.<\/p>  <p>  The new web page attracted more than 10,500 visits during the campaign with an average time of over three minutes spent on the page which is regarded as very favourable.<\/p>  <p>  Scope section received some 50 calls and 30 emails during the campaign from individuals who had become aware of the service directly as a result of the ad campaign.

While I understand this figure was calculated as approximately 37% in 2012, the latest EU Gender Pension Gap figure (including second and third pillar pensions),\u00a0amounts to\u00a026% in Ireland.  The equivalent figure across the EU is 37%, and so the Irish figure is significantly lower than the norm across Europe, rather than higher as suggested in the details supplied with the\u00a0question.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that most of this gap refers to differences in payments from occupational and private pensions as conversely, the gap between average State pension payments to men and women over 66 made by my department is currently 1%.  This reflects the different dynamics of 4 state pension payments &ndash; 3 of which benefit women more than men, and one (the State pension contributory) which benefits men more than women.  Changing patterns in working lives over the decades are expected to continue to see the outcomes for male and female retirees converge over time.<\/p>  <p>  Another EU statistic is\u00a0the gender gap among over 65s in the &ldquo;At Risk of Poverty and Social Exclusion (AROPE)&rdquo; indicator.  This gap\u00a0is 2.0% in Ireland, compared to 5.6% in the EU, and is the 4th lowest among the 28 Member States.  The three countries with a lower\u00a0gender gap in this measure than Ireland,\u00a0all have a bigger Gender Pension Gap than we do.<\/p>  <p>  As a general policy, the Government intends to introduce a Total Contributions Approach (TCA) to establishing level of entitlement for all new state pension contributory claims from 2020 onwards.  Separately, I announced on 23rd January an interim TCA for those affected by the 2012 rate-band changes.  Under this approach, a person who reached pension age after 1 September 2012 (i.e., who is among those affected by the new ratebands introduced from that date) and who has a 40 year record of paid and credited social insurance contributions, subject to a maximum of 20 years of credits, will qualify for a maximum contributory pension where they satisfy the other qualifying conditions for the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Up to 20 years of HomeCaring credits, and\/or 10 years of other qualifying credits (e.g.,\u00a0when unemployed or ill) may be used, subject to the total number of credits not exceeding 20 years.  This approach is expected to significantly benefit many people, particularly women, whose work history includes an extended period of time outside the paid workplace, while raising families or in a caring role.

There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system.<\/p>  <p>  Firstly there is the contributory principle which links the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and their entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid, subject to legislative provisions, where a particular contingency arises, and without a means test.  <\/p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle where the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more likely to have an income need as a result of circumstances that have arisen in their lives.  In this regard, it should be noted that most PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  It should also be noted that access to Widow&rsquo;s\/Widower&rsquo;s\/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory Pension is available to those who have been married or in a civil partnership only, and that scheme will not benefit someone who has been single all their life. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the benefits and pension system is to provide a person with an adequate income.  The rate of payment is set with this objective in mind, and the fact that there are a number of ways one can qualify for a pension does not mean someone may qualify for multiple PRSI-funded payments at the same time.  As is common with social security systems across the world, the Irish social welfare system generally applies the principle of one person, one full payment. <\/p>  <p>  It can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time, e.g., an unemployed person may also become sick and incapable of work.  The PRSI paid by the person and their employers only provides coverage for one payment at such times.  Under the legislation for the schemes, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, generally he or she can receive only one core payment.  Amending the social welfare system to allow Illness Benefit (or Jobseekers Benefit if they are unemployed) to be paid in addition to a pension such as a Widow&rsquo;s pension would be a significant change to the system, as it would in effect be a double payment, providing certain people with the income currently paid for two people, and would greatly increase costs.  This extra cost would have to be financed from either an increase in the rate of PRSI contributions, an increase in the Exchequer subvention to the scheme, or a reduction in the rate of payments. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of supports in the social welfare system which benefit widows, including those of working age such as the Fuel Allowance Scheme. To receive Fuel Allowance, Widows pension recipients must also satisfy the other conditions for that payment, i.e., be unable to provide for their heating needs from the resources of their household, live alone or only with one of a list of exempted persons, and satisfy a means test. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, a widow aged between 60 and 65 years, whose late spouse\/civil partner received the Household Benefits package from this Department, may qualify for that package if they otherwise satisfy all other conditions and receive a relevant qualifying payment. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1359"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Meals Programme","counter":2021,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2022,"qnumday":751,"qnumall":"[37529\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the status of a meals grant application by a school (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2023,"content":"<p>The school meals programme provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,580 schools and organisations benefitting 250,000 children at a total cost of &euro;54 million in 2018 representing an increase of &euro;6.5 million over the previous year.

Carers are entitled to an extra half-rate carer&rsquo;s allowance if they care for more than one person and a respite care grant for each care recipient.  <\/p>  <p>  Credited contributions, normally known as credits, are awarded to recipients of carer&rsquo;s benefit and of carer&rsquo;s allowance where they have an underlying entitlement to credits.  Recipients of these payments qualify for credits where they have at least one paid contribution in the previous two years or have had credited contributions in that period.  Credits are also awarded to workers who take unpaid carer&rsquo;s leave from work.  <\/p>  <p>  Credits protect social insurance entitlements by bridging gaps in an employee&rsquo;s social insurance record, where they are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods spent caring.  In combination with paid PRSI contributions, credits assist employees in qualifying for short-term schemes and enhance the level of benefit for long-term schemes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, all carers, including those who do not qualify for a payment or for credits, may qualify for the homemaker scheme.  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme is designed to help homemakers and carers qualify for state pension (contributory).  Years spent caring on a full-time basis are disregarded when calculating the state pension (contributory) rate of payment. <\/p>  <p>  Through the award of credits and the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme, the social insurance system already gives significant recognition of the service provided by carers.

This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by roughly &euro;1 billion every 5 years.

If the age for the State pension (contributory) and the State pension (non-contributory) were both reduced to 65 from 66, rather than the reintroduction of State pension (transition), there would be an additional cost as the State pension (contributory) does not have the retirement criterion that the State pension (transition) did.  There would, therefore, be an additional cost to the Social Insurance Fund, paid in respect of people who would still work while aged 65, in addition to receiving the State Pension (contributory).  There would also be an additional cost in respect of those with insufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for the State pension (contributory) who, prior to 2014, would still have to work until 66 to qualify for a pension.

There are two basic principles which underpin the Irish social insurance system. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the State pension non-contributory is a means-tested pension funded from taxation.  Secondly, the State pension contributory, which is not means-tested, but is based on social insurance contributions, is paid from the Social Insurance Fund.  Accordingly, it is important to ensure those qualifying for the State pension contributory have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions, paid or credited, over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.<\/p>  <p>  The idea of a universal State pension, paid at full rate to everyone over 66, regardless of their contributions or their means, has been proposed on a number of occasions, and officials in my Department have examined such proposals a number of times.  There are significant issues regarding the scope such a pension would have, particularly in respect of its interaction with public service pensions, and with occupational pensions in companies that were previously part of the public service.  Additionally, consideration would have to be given to the treatment of retirees who are not resident in the State, but who have built up a contributory pension entitlement over the years that they worked here and paid PRSI.  There are also potential legal issues regarding treating occupational pensions differently when they are in the public or private sector.<\/p>  <p>  These factors make precise costing of such a pension challenging.  However, it is clear that regardless of decisions made regarding these factors, the cost would be very substantial, and officials in my Department believe that the additional cost could be expected to be over &euro;1 billion per annum, and potentially substantially more depending on some of the factors I mention above.  <\/p>  <p>  Clearly, this would either be very expensive or, if introduced on a cost-neutral basis, require very significant diversion of funds from elsewhere, e.g. a large reduction in the current rate of the State pension, substantial increases in the rate of PRSI deductions, or equivalent measures reducing tax relief on occupational and private pensions, which would impact very significantly upon the take-home pay of the workers affected, and act as a disincentive to such pension provision. <\/p>  <p>  The biggest beneficiaries would be people who, not only contributed less to the Social Insurance Fund, but who have significant additional means, resulting in their not qualifying for a non-contributory pension, which is paid at up to 95% that of the maximum contributory pension rate.  Those who contributed most to the system, including those with no additional means, and widows depending on a single pension from the state, would receive no benefit at all from the additional spending involved.  However, such people could be significantly impacted by any subsequent restraint in increases in the rate of the pension caused by the larger state pension bill faced by the Exchequer.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to pension entitlements would have to be considered in the overall budgetary context. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Illness Benefit Applications","counter":2075,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE06800"},{"type":"question","counter":2076,"qnumday":769,"qnumall":"[37774\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800082#WREE06900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if arrears of qualified adult allowance and qualified child allowance are due to a person (details supplied) in regard to an illness benefit claim; if so, when the arrears will be issued; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1365","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":2077,"content":"<p>The Department experienced some delay following the introduction of a new system for Illness benefit.

Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers.<\/p><p>In addition, local authorities also have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003, the Housing Acts and the Planning and Development Acts, all of which may be relevant where fire safety concerns arise in residential developments. Fire services may inspect buildings in cases of defects or complaints in respect of fire safety.  They work with building owners to ensure immediate risks are addressed, and put a plan in place for works to bring buildings into compliance. They have enforcement powers for cases where co-operation is not forthcoming, or progress cannot be made on an agreed basis.  Given these clear statutory roles, it is the local authority that the residents concerned should engage with.<\/p><p>In the interest of supporting owners and residents living in developments where concerns regarding non-compliance with fire safety requirements arise, it was agreed that a review be undertaken by an independent fire expert to develop a framework for general application.  In August 2017, the <i>Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings <\/i>was published, which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern.

The Survey, which covers metropolitan housing markets in nine countries (Australia, Canada, China, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States), uses data for the third quarter of 2017 and covers areas in Ireland with a population of 50,000 people or more. It reported that, relative to household income, Ireland has the most affordable housing costs compared to all other countries included in the Survey. It does, however, point to a significant affordability challenge in Dublin and an affordability issue in Cork and Galway. <\/p>  <p>  As Minister, I have been clear that we need to address housing affordability, recognising the pressures that exist for low- to middle-income households, particularly in Dublin and certain other of our main urban centres. The delivery of targeted affordable housing, for purchase and rent, was a priority topic at the Housing Summit which I held with Local Authority Chief Executives in July. It is also featured prominently at the post-Housing Summit meeting with Local Authority Housing Directors of Service and at a Forum I held with Approved Housing Bodies on 17 September.<\/p>  <p>  A three-pronged, targeted approach to affordable housing provision is being pursued, aimed at households earning low to moderate annual gross incomes at a maximum of &euro;50,000 for single applicants and &euro;75,000 for dual applicants.  Firstly, in terms of affordable housing for purchase, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing. This Scheme will be delivered by local authorities developing sites in key locations. The Scheme will be complementary to other Government schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, I am also determined that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. There is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live aswell as work. Cost rental is an important component of progressive housing systems around Europe. <\/p>  <p>  In this regard, I have announced details of a major cost rental project with the potential to deliver over 300 cost rental homes at Emmet Road, Inchicore, as part of a mixed-tenure development of some 470 homes in total. In parallel, the Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working on a smaller-scale cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, the tenders for which will issue shortly.  Learning from these pilot projects, cost rental will now be rolled out across other suitable sites.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, in order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I am providing &euro;75 million in Exchequer funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  The bids received from local authorities under this first call are now being assessed and I expect to make initial funding awards next month.  <\/p>  <p>  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites for at least 10,000 new affordable homes from local authority-owned land.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has now launched the Land Development Agency, which will be aiming to deliver some 150,000 new homes over the next 20 years. The new Agency has an immediate focus on managing the State&rsquo;s own lands to develop new homes, and regenerate under-utilised sites, and will deliver at least 40% of any housing potential on such lands for both social and affordable housing purposes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800083#WRFF06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing Provision","counter":2153,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800083#WRFF07000"},{"type":"question","counter":2154,"qnumday":794,"qnumall":"[37415\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800083#WRFF07100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his Department has assessed the nature of the delays being experienced in respect of local authorities signing contracts with developers for Part V properties for social housing; and the measures he plans to implement to expedite same.","asker":"1253","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2155,"content":"<p>My Department keeps the January 2017 Guidelines on Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 under review, in consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is in contact with housing authorities in relation to whether there are any delays in signing contracts for new build homes pursuant to Part V agreements.

The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.<\/p><p>- Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy.

The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes. <\/p><p>- Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from the Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.

Accordingly, the information requested is not available in my Department, but may be obtained directly from the individual local authorities concerned.<\/p><p>Since 1 January 2016, my Department has received 124 housing-related staff sanction requests from Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council, 120 of which have been approved, with 4 pending. Posts that are pending, in general, are awaiting supporting information prior to a final decision being taken.<table><tr><th>Local authority <\/th><th>2016 <\/th><th>2017 <\/th><th>2018 @17\/9 <\/th><th>Total <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City Council<\/td><td>15 <\/td><td>23 <\/td><td>33 <\/td><td>71 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire - Rathdown County Council<\/td><td>4 <\/td><td>2 <\/td><td>17 <\/td><td>23 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council<\/td><td>2 <\/td><td>8 <\/td><td>15 <\/td><td>25 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin County Council<\/td><td>5 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>0 <\/td><td>5 <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total per year <\/td><td>26 <\/td><td>33 <\/td><td>65 <\/td><td>124 <\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800084#WRGG01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Accommodation","counter":2175,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800084#WRGG01400"},{"type":"question","counter":2176,"qnumday":803,"qnumall":"[37634\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800084#WRGG01500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the allocation and spend of the Traveller accommodation budget of each local authority from the inception of the programme through to 2008, in tabular form.","asker":"1215","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":2177,"content":"<p>In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.

My Department has recognised the need to support local authorities in their efforts to increase both capacity and output in this regard. In addition to substantial capital and current funding provided under Rebuilding Ireland, additional dedicated co-ordinated support resources including the Housing Delivery Office, my Department is providing a range of additional staff related supports including:  <\/p><p>- Local authorities have designated Vacant Homes Officers to act as a central point of contact and to provide information and advice for owners of vacant homes and also to deal with queries from members of the public in respect of private residential vacant properties in their administrative area.  My Department has provided funding for each local authority (&euro;50,000 per annum, for a period of two years (i.e. a total of &euro;100,000 to each local authority for 2018 &amp;amp; 2019)) to support the work of a Vacant Homes Office. The provision of central funding will allow for focus to be given to the role of the Office in establishing a co-ordinated approach towards the implementation of their Vacant Homes Action Plans and will reinforce the capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Vacant Homes Unit to liaise with and seek information\/statistics from a dedicated contact point within each local authority. The Vacant Homes Office is expected to play a key role in the co-ordination of this work within the local authority.<\/p><p>- Earlier this year my Department advised local authorities of arrangements for the appointment (where required) of a dedicated staff member to provide assistance in seeking out potential properties; establishing relationships with local property agents and landlords; supporting those homeless households to exit emergency accommodation and secure a tenancy. An allowance towards the staffing cost of this officer is recoupable from the Department via the homeless services (&lsquo;Section 10&rsquo;) recoupment arrangements.<\/p><p>- The Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and a range of different leasing schemes funded by the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) all provide local authorities with administrative payments in respect of new households entering the schemes and for certain on-going monitoring and management expenses. The purpose of these payments is to recognise the resources required by local authorities in respect of the set up and management of tenancies under these programmes. <\/p><p>- Local authority in-house professional services assigned to the delivery of new capital funded social housing build projects can be recouped from the Department at a percentage of the approved tender cost, with the actual percentage depending on the services provided.  Services covered include architectural and other design team professional services, contract monitoring and management and the assigned certifier role.

The Scheme complements other Government Schemes which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the new Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that cost rental homes become a major part of our rental landscape in the future to fill a gap between social housing and the rental market, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.

Key highlights of this capital investment include:<\/p>  <p>  - The on-going management, development and operation of our 87,000 hectare National Park and Nature Reserve Network.<\/p>  <p>  - The expansion of Wicklow Mountains National Park with the purchase of 4,900 acres (or 1,983 hectares) of the Dublin Uplands, in the area known popularly as the Featherbeds. This land increased the total size of the National Park to over 22,000 hectares. The Department completed the purchase in December 2016 for &euro;800,000.00<\/p>  <p>  - &euro;390,000 was spent in 2017 on consolidating National Parks property. The Department purchased an OPW property in Corofin for future use in respect of the Burren National Park, and purchased 800 acres at Altnabrockey in Mayo to consolidate its holding in the Wild Nephin.<\/p>  <p>  - Trail maintenance continued with on-going upgrades to the popular Diamond Hill in Connemara National park, the resurfacing of the Blue Road at Shrahduggan in Ballycroy National Park and on-going clearance of scrub and invasive species in a number of National Parks and Nature Reserves.<\/p>  <p>  - Upgrading of the road network in Killarney National Park and the restoration of the historic windows and essential maintenance and restoration works to the roof of Muckross House.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to 2018 expenditure by my Department, the Deputy will be aware, that such expenditure is presently on-going  and subject to internal verification and monitoring processes. Adjustments may fall to be made between subheads as part of this process and all figures are subject to audit by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  2018 expenditure will include the conclusion of the multi-million euro investment in the restoration Killarney House and Gardens. Following on from the successful opening of the restored ornamental gardens in April 2016 and the opening of the 3 Historic Rooms of Killarney House in July 2017 the Department&rsquo;s phased completion of the Killarney House &amp;amp; Gardens project at Killarney National Park will conclude with the formal opening of the 18 Room Visitor Centre and Exhibition on the 28th of September, 2018. Roughly 55,000 people have visited the rooms since their opening in July 2017 with more than 375,000 visitors to the Garden since their opening in April 2016. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to such direct investments by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department has been proactively working in partnership with other State agencies, to further develop the Park and Reserves Network and support marketing initiatives such as the Wild Atlantic Way and Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East<\/p>  <p>  In December 2017, the Department announced the expansion of Ballycroy National Park with the addition of the Wild Nephin area, expanding the total size of the National Park to over 15,000 hectares. This was the culmination of constructive engagement between Coillte and the Department addressing a long-standing strategy to align key environmental assets. The National Parks and Wildlife Service will now manage this transfer of land and a public amenity conversion plan will be put in place. Overall, the project reflects the on-going commitment of all stakeholders to improve the recreational potential of this area whilst ensuring the highest standards of nature conservation. Work in this regard is on-going.<\/p>  <p>  In January 2017, the Department entered into Strategic Investment Partnership with Fa&iacute;lte Ireland, aimed at enhancing and promoting the tourism offering at Ireland&rsquo;s National Parks and also conserving and protecting the natural environments of the National Parks for the enjoyment of future generations. Since then, more than &euro;400k has been expended on scoping and feasibility studies for the development of capital projects. In July of this year, as part of this partnership, we published Experiencing the Wild heart of Ireland &ndash; A Tourism Interpretative Masterplan for the National Parks and Nature Reserves.  The Plan sets out a framework that will guide the phased development of enhanced visitor experiences and improved visitor facilities at our National Parks and Reserves, taking into account our  conservational objectives and based upon research into international best practice.  <\/p>  <p>  The plan recommends a suite of capital projects of varying size (from smaller scale interventions such as installation of viewing platforms to larger projects such as the development of new boardwalks and trails, to the construction of new visitor centres). From these proposals, projects will be funded jointly by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and F&aacute;ilte Ireland through a multi-million Euro investment package over the coming years. The first such project, a &euro;2.1m investment in Wild Nephin- Ballycroy National Park was announced on the 31st of August, 2018 to develop a continuous 53km walking cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the National Park.  At present a section of the waymarked Western Way (200km linear trail from Galway to Mayo) runs north-southwards through the eastern portion of Wild Nephin providing a continuous 53km walking cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way.  This project will eliminate the need to walk the busy R312 by creating a spur which will provide a more direct and safe route on quiet tracks through bogland and forests. The outcome of this project will be an off road continuous cycling and walking trail in challenging terrain which will link the popular Great Western Greenway with the Wild Atlantic Way.  This 56km section of the Western Way has potential to be walked\/cycled for its full 56km and be promoted internationally as a unique, off road Grade 3 trail of scale to meet the rising demand for challenging outdoor recreational activity that is away from it all. The funding will provide opportunities for existing and new private sector operators in bike hire, guiding, outdoor recreation and will in time, support the accommodation and food sectors. The experience will appeal to domestic and international visitors that seek an off-road, wild experience on the western edge of Europe. Importantly, the project will ensure that the area is accessed in a sustainable way, protecting the habitat and directing tourists through a managed route.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to its interactions with Faillte and Coillte, the Department has successfully operated a joint management arrangement the Trustees of Muckross House since the early 1980s. As part of the Department and the Trustees ongoing commitment to the development, conservation and presentation of Killarney National Park, a regular programme of jointly funded capital projects are undertaken.  A restoration of the of the Victorian Servants&rsquo; Dining Hall and Laundry Room in the basement of Muckross House was commenced last year and is due to finish shortly. It is estimated that the total costs associated with this restoration project will be in the order of &euro;400,000.  This latest project at Muckross House follows on from the significant investment in refurbishing the original metal-framed windows, which also included repairs to the roof, chimneys, gutters and downpipes, during 2016 and 2017.  These capital investment projects at Muckross House, derive directly from the Memorandum of Agreement between the Department and the Board of Trustees, providing tangible evidence of the cooperation of a Government Department and a locally based not-for-profit body.<\/p>  <p>  Under \"Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage, 2018 &ndash; 2027\" capital investment of some &euro;50m has been earmarked for the National Parks and Nature Reserves. This investment ensures long term protection of the National Parks and Reserves and my Department is delighted to have this opportunity for investment and implementation of measures to protect our habitats, landscapes and wildlife.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800084#WRGG05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"question","counter":2216,"qnumday":817,"qnumall":"[37126\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018091800084#WRGG05500","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason an action (details supplied) under the Action Plan for Rural Development was not delivered by the timeline committed to; the revised timeline by quarter and year for delivery of this action; if no revised timeline has been set to date, the reason therefor; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":2217,"content":"<p>Significant progress has been made in the consultations with key stakeholders on the new National Heritage Plan for Ireland (Heritage Ireland 2030).
