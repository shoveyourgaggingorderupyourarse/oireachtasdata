He is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.<\/p> <p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.<\/p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of 18 April have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  No matters arise that will not come up under correspondence.<\/p> <p>   We will proceed to correspondence.  There are three categories.<\/p><p>Category A is correspondence relating to the briefing document and opening statements.  Nos. 2149A and 2150A from the Office of the Garda Commissioner, dated 3 May and 7 May 2019, are the briefing document and opening statement for today's meeting.  Is it agreed to note and publish these?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers, follow-up to meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.<\/p><p> No. 2121B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills.  It is dated 16 April 2019 and provides information on the arrangements for the internal audit for education and training boards, ETBs, and the steps taken by the Department to resolve any issue.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; provides an update on the internal audit arrangements of the City of Dublin ETB and the ETB internal audit unit.  We note this and will publish it.  We know there have been difficulties and we are pleased the Department is starting to give this matter greater priority, attention and resources.  We will take this into consideration as part of our periodic report.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises there is an increased budget, as I have mentioned, and that the Department is jointly commissioning a wider review of internal audit in the sector to ascertain the longer-term support required to deliver an ongoing and appropriate internal audit function.  We have mentioned this.  One unit is based in Cavan and there are difficulties recruiting people to travel throughout the country.  The Department is examining this issue, which we welcome, but we will consider this as part of our periodic report because, as I have stated, we have not been happy with the internal audit function in the ETB sector and it is good that it is now being addressed.<\/p><p> No. 2122B is from Mr. John McCarthy, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  It provides a detailed response requested by the committee to a number of matters raised at our meeting with him on 28 February 2019.  We will note and publish this.  Any member who wants to comment on it is welcome to do so.  We will take the contents into consideration when finalising our report on housing issues.  A lot of information has to be incorporated in the report.<\/p><p> Deputies Catherine Murphy and Cassells wish to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#A00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I was going to make exactly that point.  There is some information that would be useful for the report.  In recent weeks, an issue with regard to the cost of turnkey as opposed to direct build was revealed and we should include it.  It is something that was raised here and we got an undertaking that the categories would be published separately.  On average, it costs about one third more to buy turnkey as opposed to a direct build.  Given the scale of the housing crisis, direct build would certainly be a big part of the solution.<\/p> <p>  How do we intend to go about publishing the report?  It was to be a dual report on the national broadband plan and the work we have done on housing.  We have had hearings on both.  I realise an announcement was made.  We had a meeting scheduled yesterday to look at the draft report but a majority of the committee decided not to go ahead with it.  What way will we proceed?  There is a valuable contribution to be made in the work we have done on broadband, particularly on the forerunner to the national broadband plan, which was the metropolitan area networks.  The draft report is a start but there are significant gaps that we need to address.  We will have to meet and go through the gaps.  Is it intended to publish the housing report separately?  Is it intended to have a dual report?  What will we decide to do?  What is the plan of action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#B00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>For the public record, we had a private meeting scheduled for yesterday to discuss documents produced by the secretariat as a result of the various meetings we have held in recent months.  One of these documents is on broadband and the metropolitan area networks and the other is on housing.  The timescale would have been quite tight with regard to discussing it yesterday and finalising it today - after our meeting with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na - with a view to getting absolute clearance for publication next week.<\/p> <p>  I always took the view that we could not publish it within 48 hours of the local and European elections.  It was always going to be a tight squeeze to get it out eight days in advance of the elections, which is the middle of next week.  When the Government announced its intention to appoint a preferred bidder for the national broadband plan, and we can now see there is a highly charged political debate between the Government and the Opposition, I felt that for the Committee of Public Accounts to wade in to discuss and finalise a report on broadband might be perceived as the committee wading into a current political controversy.  I took the view that I do not want the committee to be accused of this.  We might not have had agreement in any event because different views are held by Government members and Opposition members.  I felt the most prudent thing to do was to hold it over.  We will certainly complete our work but I felt that in the politically charged debate during these days I did not want to involve the committee at this time.  We will certainly complete our work as soon as is practical.  As Chairman I felt it was better not to proceed.  The secretariat phoned around and two thirds of the committee agreed to postpone.  We will come back to it.<\/p> <p>  I also felt that a lot of the information that came out on Tuesday may have been relevant to incorporate in our report, which we would not have been able to sign off within 24 or 48 hours of the documentation becoming available.  I felt the prudent thing to do was to let the political side of it get out of the way and then the Committee of Public Accounts would do its work, as it always does, outside of the current political controversy.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge publicly that Deputy Catherine Murphy was keen that the meeting should have proceeded as scheduled and I accept this.  The majority took the opposite view.  I accept that a significant part of the work prepared by the secretariat was on the metropolitan area networks but because it was connected to broadband in the same report I felt we could not go into it in this political climate.  The idea was, subject to agreement of the committee, that we would publish two reports simultaneously on the same day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>When are we talking about doing the housing report?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#B00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>As soon as is practical.

Deputy Catherine Murphy and I have consistently made the point on the contribution towards other housing aspects.  My county is mentioned with regard to the failure of the mortgage to rent scheme.  Traveller accommodation is also mentioned.  There is a plethora of issues that could be examined.<\/p> <p>  At our meeting with the Secretary General, I raised points in respect of the local property tax take.  The Taoiseach has made a particular pledge that all property tax will be retained locally so that local authorities running a surplus will no longer have to contribute to the equalisation fund.  When I asked the Secretary General about this he had no idea how it would be achieved.<\/p><p>In that respect, we are talking about a serious amount of money.  It is a serious matter for the holder of the most prominent office in the country to say that and it is an issue that has not been addressed.  Political promises have since been made in local election manifestos that all councils under Fine Gael will cut local property tax.  When we examine the documents that have been brought forward, we see the strain certain Departments and councils are operating under and their failure to achieve what they should be achieving.  I am telling members of the committee that the documents raise even more questions.  One could have a fresh debate on them.  I look forward to using them in the compilation of the committee's report.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#B01200","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and invite Deputy Cullinane to comment on the general issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#C00200","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I will cover the two issues.

Obviously, we have the letter from Mr. Robert Watt, that is, the memo that was published yesterday.  Given that we now have that letter, how do we intend to deal with it in the context of our broadband report which essentially is unfinished business?  I know that it will deal with a lot of other issues also.  We have a number of options, including that we proceed with our report as is and deal with the letter separately or we deal with it and the questions it raises as part of an ongoing process and perhaps incorporate our examination of Mr. Watt's concerns into the report.

We listed all of the projects, starting with the national children's hospital and on through ten major projects.  We had a discussion with Mr. Watt on the national broadband plan.  A member of the committee - perhaps it was the Deputy - asked him whether he thought it should go ahead.  He said it was more than his job was worth to answer that question in public.  Clearly, he has now indicated publicly.  As a result of the discussion we had on capital projects, we are writing to him for an unredacted version of all correspondence because we have previously discussed the particular matter.  I think the Committee of Public Accounts will today formally request an unredacted version.  When we receive it, we can decide on the next step to be taken.  Obviously, there is information he did not want to share on the day and there might now be an opportunity to have a full discussion on that information now that it has been published in the meantime.

It is good that there is robust engagement between that Department and others.  Then there is the response of the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is a welcome development.  The Comptroller and Auditor General had, in fact, called for that type of reporting and such issues to be published in advance of major projects being completed because the Government decides based on all of the information it has received what is the best course of action.  This is the first time I have seen a letter that is so stark in its critique of a project which at that point had not been signed off on.  As this is new, how do we as a committee examine it?  It is a political decision that was made at Cabinet level, but at the same time fundamental questions were raised about value for money.  Value for money is exactly what we consider which normally involves a look-back.  Obviously, the Comptroller and Auditor General also engages in a look-back, but now that the issue is live and given that the letter was so stark and Mr. Watt was so clear in his concerns about the project, we need to look at it in a way we have not done before.  We have not seen such a robust letter from a Secretary General before.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#C00700","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I concur with Deputy Cullinane's views.

The correspondence is very important and if there is further correspondence from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment that was not issued, we will want to see it as it will help to inform our consideration.<\/p> <p>  In case people ask why is the committee which normally looks back looking for a contract, the reason is that significant expenditure has been incurred on this project in recent years.  Therefore, the national broadband plan, the cost of tendering, the cost of consultants, the cost benefit analysis, the first draft of the plan and the revised draft when the European Union forced the Government to remove the 300,000 houses Eir stated it would cover have had implications in terms of further expenditure.  We are looking at the expenditure that has been incurred to date and want to see whether what has been done to date will result in the achievement of value for money.  Obviously, that will have implications for future expenditure.  We are absolutely acting within our remit in looking at all expenditure incurred in previous years lest anybody doubts why we are doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#C00800","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I was one of the members who agreed that the meeting should be deferred, partly for personal reasons in that I was attending a funeral, but I did not agree to it being deferred for political reasons.

Roads are more predictable, and local authorities, which very often lead the development of roads, have fine-tuned the work on those.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the point that Deputy Cassells made about the local property tax, the more complicated one makes something, the more one gets away with it.  Local government funding is just so confusing.  The Government in the last general election talked about not introducing any new taxes.  No new income taxes were introduced, but there are things in this that really should be a cause of concern.  I do not think that when local property tax was introduced there was an expectation that it would fund housing or roads.  It was not sold as such.  The point has been made that it is a local property tax, is wholly retained in one particular area and is not a replacement for subvention for projects that comes from central Government.  We now have a Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  We were told that the purpose of that committee was that if the Opposition makes demands for things to be done, and Deputy Cassell's party has been criticised by Fine Gael quite heavily on this, the committee would have a responsibility to look at them to see if they are possible.  Why do we not ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to have a look at what the cost would be of making this a wholly local property tax, as opposed to a replacement for the grants that come from various Departments?  That would be a valuable and ongoing piece of work for that committee.  I know we are supposed to leave our politics outside the door when we come in here, but we in the Social Democrats did our own budget, as other parties do, in advance of the budget being announced.  We included in our budget an amount for the cost of precisely such a proposal.  However, it is only when one goes looking at this that one realises how costly it is, so we should do that.  We should ask the Committee on Budgetary Oversight to look specifically at the local property tax.

This topic frustrates me.  We should spend a month on it because we deal with it maybe once a year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General  in his report always refers to the myriad funding going into local government, but the matter comes in and out of here in half a day.  We should spend a whole month on it because it has the biggest impact on local people's lives bar none.  That self-funding aspect for housing and roads was a huge sleight of hand that the ordinary person would not have understood in the context of aspects of local government that were previously funded through a central fund from the Custom House.  Counties such as Meath, Kildare and Dublin were now having to fund this themselves out of people's local property tax, as opposed to the funding coming from a central fund.  That was a huge issue, and the impact is of course that there is less money to spend on some other aspect of local services.  People ask where their local property tax is going, but suddenly these moneys are being used to fund what had previously been funded through a central Government fund.  That is the sleight of hand.  These are the kinds of things that need to come out into the public domain in order that people can understand the significance of what is being done in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the impact it is having on local services.  It is a question of how one squares the circle of promising people there will be no increase in their property tax, that the Government is actually going to reduce it, and that counties such as Dublin and Meath can retain all their property tax but the Government will somehow find the money to fund services in Leitrim and Longford as well.

I am delighted to see every line we write is scrutinised so closely.  I am impressed.  It is good.  We will come back to this as part of our assessment of the response from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  There are three items related to our inquiries regarding the ongoing review of matters in Waterford Institute of Technology.  No. 2125B, from Mr. William Beausang of the Department of Education and Skills, gives an update requested by the committee on the next steps regarding the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from telecommunications software systems group at Waterford IT, which was not completed for legal reasons relating to the remit of the Higher Education Authority.  The Department is prepared to examine issues by the contributors to the HEA report if contributors give their permission to forward their information to the Department.  In parallel, the Department is continuing to examine matters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry in Waterford IT and has raised a number of questions about WIT's governing body.  Mr. Beausang advises that the Department will keep the committee updated when there are further developments.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence No. 2140B - as I said, there are three items related to this topic - is from Ms Stephanie Goode of the Department of Education and Skills, confirming that the Department has received responses mentioned in the last item from the governing body of Waterford Institute of Technology to the questions posed by the Department.  Ms Goode advises that the responses are currently under active consideration by officials in the Department.  It is agreed that we will note and publish this.<\/p> <p>  Also related to this matter is No. 2136B from Mr. Paul O'Toole, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, regarding the authority's draft report on WIT regarding the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  The HEA previously advised the committee that it was unable to complete the review as it did not have the legal powers to do so.  Separately, the HEA did not agree to release the draft report to the Right to Know group following an FOI request.  Mr. O'Toole advises that this decision was partially overturned by the Information Commissioner on appeal.  That is good.  Somebody was doing their job.  The Information Commissioner determined that chapters 1 to 4 of the draft report should be released.  Mr. O'Toole enclosed a copy of this document for the information of the committee.  He does draw our attention to possible legal difficulties if the Right to Know group or others, such as this committee, publish this item.<\/p><p>I propose that we publish Mr. O'Toole's letter but that we do not publish the related document at this time.  We might get agreement to that.

I welcome that Mr. Beausang's letter responds to the concerns in our letter.  We ended up in a situation where we had the draft report, which was redacted with all the conclusions left out.  Essentially, all we got was the context, the terms of reference and so on.  We did not get any of the conclusions or recommendations that would have formed part of that report.  Mr. Beausang's letter indicates that the Department may follow through with some form of examination of this issue themselves.  Mr. Beausang sets out the powers that the Department of Education and Skills and the Minister have.  My reading of what Mr. Beausang has said is that the Department has not concluded yet and that it has not settled on what the course of action will be, but that it will make some recommendation to the Minister, which may be to appoint under the Act a special investigator to investigate the claims.<\/p> <p>  There is a bit of a worry, however, in the reference going back to the whistleblowers and those people who came forward and made protected disclosures, which is fair enough.  The Department indicates that the advice is to go through the normal procedures in Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, to make protected disclosures.  I believe that the horse has bolted pretty much on that.  I have no difficulty with this being set out as an option, but the people involved have already made protected disclosures to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and we have to protect the integrity of the process.  There would be a concern if people came forward, made protected disclosures to a State body and then were told to go back to the institute.  This, however, is set out as an option.  The correspondence states also that the individuals can resubmit their disclosures to the Department, which would in turn inform whether or not the Department advises the Minister to appoint a special investigator.  It seems that an awful lot of responsibility is being put back onto the whistleblowers and onto those people who made disclosures.  I assume these are all busy people and are concerned that they were left hanging.  The committee will be aware that some of them have been in contact with me.  They may decide that they will not follow through on this.  We do not know.  It is a little bit unsettling that the correspondence seems to be putting a lot of onus on what the whistleblowers and those who made disclosures should do rather than on the Department following through.  I suggest that this committee recommends to the Department that it proceeds with appointing an investigator.  We wanted a report.  The issue of concern for us was that the HEA did a report that was outside the scope of its powers.  That is acknowledged.  The Attorney General has acknowledged this.  The Department, however, has set out that it has the power under the Act.  None of this has ever examined the details of the private company and what it did.  It was at all times the activities of the institute and the interactions between the institute and the private company.  This is what Mr. McCloone had looked at, what the Comptroller and Auditor General had looked at and what this committee looked at in our hearings on the matter.  I would suggest that we strongly recommend that the Department does this.

As indicated in the diagram, which can be now brought on screen, almost two thirds of the expenditure was related to payment of salaries, wages and allowances, which totalled &euro;1.076 billion in 2017.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na spent &euro;327 million on pension and gratuity payments to retired garda&iacute;.<\/p> <p>  Apart from standard administration costs, expenditure was incurred on operational inputs, including transport, communications and other operational equipment, and building, maintenance and servicing of stations and other buildings.  Unlike other large Votes, the account does not analyse spending in terms of output programmes such as traffic policing, fraud investigation or other specialist functions.<\/p> <p>  At the end of 2017, approximately 16,200 whole-time equivalent staff were employed, of which just under 14,000 were garda&iacute; or trainees, and 2,200 were civilian employees with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The Vote for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is one of the few Votes that routinely receives a Supplementary Estimate towards the end of the year.  A Supplementary Estimate of a little over &euro;44 million was voted for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2017.  At the end of the year, the amount remaining unspent was &euro;14.2 million.  Of this, &euro;8.9 million in unspent capital funding was carried over to 2018, with the remaining &euro;5.3 million liable for surrender.<\/p><p> The statement of the Accounting Officer on internal financial control discloses non-competitive procurement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of &euro;28.5 million worth of goods and services in 2017, included a significant level of procurement that was not compliant with public procurement rules.  This is a recurrent issue in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The statement on internal financial control also discloses significant financial and other risks faced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as well as the steps taken to address those risks.<\/p><p> Chapter 7 examined the systems in place to manage overtime spending in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2017, overtime payments totalled &euro;132 million or 12% of the overall Garda pay bill.  This level of spending was up to three times the level of spending on overtime in other police forces and three and a half times the overtime cost of &euro;38 million incurred by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2014.  In addition, actual expenditure exceeded the Estimate provision for overtime in each of the five years to 2017.  Excess spending on overtime was the main reason for the Supplementary Estimate in 2017.<\/p><p> Our review found that the management practices in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to control the overtime budget were ineffective.  We concluded that the data recording and collation systems in use were deficient.  While they record the basic information needed to authorise and support the correctness of the overtime payments, they failed to provide the basis for the analysis required to effectively deploy staff resources, monitor use and identify potential economies and efficiencies.  We also found that, while some measures had been introduced to curb overtime costs in the first half of 2018, there was no detailed plan for how the overtime bill could be substantially reduced and sustained.  When the report was being finalised, the Accounting Officer stated in response to this finding that several initiatives were currently being piloted that had the potential to achieve better control of overtime use.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>Commissioner Harris, can we have your opening statement, please?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#J00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557388800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I take my statutory function of Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seriously.  I am strongly focused on ensuring that the public money invested in us is spent efficiently, effectively and appropriately.  As an organisation with a &euro;1.7 billion annual budget, it is vital that we collectively demonstrate that we are providing value for money.  For me, that means maximising our policing impact for the benefit of the public within the budget given to us by Government.  It is also critical that we spend public money in line with accounting and governance best practice.<\/p> <p>  I am strongly of the view that our budget is our budget.  Since I became Commissioner in September of last year I have continually stressed to managers at all levels of the organisation the need for us to stay within our budget.  This can best be seen in the reduction in discretionary and administrative overtime spend in last three months of 2018, a move which achieved substantial savings for the Exchequer.  The savings achieved by these measures have carried forward into 2019 as the actual spend for the first quarter of &euro;21.7 million is some &euro;6 million less than the corresponding quarter in 2018.  While we are largely on target for overtime spend, it requires constant monitoring and vigilance to ensure there is no slippage.  I met senior managers last week to stress this point to them again.  Even yesterday, I discussed budget matters with the Association of Garda Superintendents and Inspectors at length.  While these controls have had an impact on the delivery of policing, overtime is still available, especially for specific policing and security operations around organised crime and violent dissident republicans.<\/p> <p>  The introduction of mandatory 15 minute parading time is a significant proportion of the Garda overtime budget and is a fixed cost that I have no influence over at the moment.  For example, in 2019 approximately &euro;22 million of our overtime budget of &euro;95 million will be spent on the 15 minute parading time.  This effectively means that our real operational budget is only &euro;73 million.  There is also overtime associated with Garda members securing and attending courts, securing prisoners and escorting people from the country.  Again, these are regarded as non-discretionary activities.<\/p> <p>  In any event, for the proportion under our control we must ensure we stay within budget.  This means making hard choices and decisions.  For the 2017 accounts, and specifically the significant overspend on overtime in that year, there are several factors that contributed to this, such as the aforementioned mandatory 15 minute parading time as well as the major 24-7 policing resources required to protect lives and communities as a result of the outbreak of the vicious and ongoing gangland feuds.<\/p> <p>  I fully accept the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to the effect that the 2017 overspend on overtime is not sustainable and demonstrated the need for stronger controls and governance as well as the requirement for modem systems to monitor same.  In addition to the controls we have already put in place we will address these issues through a number of additional measures.  The introduction of a roster and duty management system, which is being piloted in a Dublin division and will start rolling out across the organisation later this year, will improve our ability to plan, control and manage the deployment of personnel and consequently the expenditure on overtime.  This should result in savings in overtime through more effective and efficient resource allocation.  The full roll-out of this programme will not occur until the end of 2020.  Our new divisional policing model, which is currently being piloted in four divisions, includes a greater investment in Garda staff with financial expertise who can provide local management with better information and data on their overtime and other expenditure.  Our workforce plan will advance workforce modernisation and see us deploy our personnel where they are needed most, again leading to operational efficiencies.<\/p> <p>  Information and communications technology initiatives such as our investigation management system, which has started to roll-out, and our mobility project, which this year will enable approximately 2,000 garda&iacute; to access Garda systems remotely, will reduce the time garda&iacute; have to spend on paperwork and focus their times on policing activity.

Obviously, that was the year there was a pay deal for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It was understandable.  However, the 2014 figure increased by three times in three years.  I understand 100% the position on the fixed costs of the Garda in respect of parading.  Will the Commissioner explain what that is?  Many people do not understand why that is necessary for every garda.  There are other fixed costs, which we understand the need for as well.  We often deal with accounts from different organisations, but to have a trebling in the space of three years in highly unusual.<\/p><p>Is there something specific to 2017 regarding the management of the agreed pay deal?

In some ways, that is a fixed cost.  It will cost us around &euro;22 million this year.  As the number of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na grows, that cost will continue to increase if the agreement on the 15 minutes stays in place.  That was a considerable cost in that year.  In addition, a rent allowance was built into salary in that year and also became pensionable.  That was added to the hourly rate so actual overtime became more expensive, in and of itself.  A one-time allowance became pay and that increased the hourly rate.  Those two factors contributed and also, as I said in my opening remarks, a vicious drugs feud which required an extraordinary response from the organisation was ongoing that year .  I will now ask Mr. Twomey to outline some of the operational impacts of that during the year in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Drew Harris"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557388800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>The operational element of it involved the armed support unit in the Dublin Metropolitan Region, DMR.

That has since been established and there is now a permanent armed support unit in the DMR.  The feud was an emerging issue at that time and we took the decision to respond immediately.  That meant redeploying resources into the DMR on a temporary basis and this led to increased operational demand.  In addition, we had only begun the process of backfilling our national units and there was a shortage of staff in particular areas.  We had to supplement those staff because they were the ones who were actually investigating these serious crimes.  We also put additional resources into our drugs and organised crime bureau in the form of a special crime task force.  This also resulted in the need to temporarily transfer people from other areas.  They were the main operational issues that contributed to the spike in that year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2019050900002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Twomey"},{"type":"speech","time":1557388800,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I understand that there were specific issues relating to the year in question.  We all remember what was happening in the context of the drug-related feud at the time.  There was a request made to the Department of Justice and Equality for an additional &euro;44.2 million.  There was a great deal going on at that time and serious issues had arisen.  There is not one member of this committee who does not have friends or know people who are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In the main, they are great, hardworking people and there were serious concerns around pay and conditions at that time.  Those issues were dealt with and that is not the point I am making.  We had an issue that was building from 2014 to 2017 and the overtime bill trebled in 2017.  In fairness, the Garda Commissioner has made comments on overtime in the past six months and has referred to the need to manage the budget.  The committee obviously respects that but the process by which we manage operational areas that are demand-led is important.  There are issues arising in Drogheda at the moment and Brexit has the potential to give rise to increases in demand.  This committee looks at expenditure retrospectively but we also look at processes.  How do we ensure that there will not be elasticity <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the Department, with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na submitting repeated requests for additional funding based on demand requirements?  Can we actually do that?  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na cannot predict what is going to happen next and neither can I.  How do we ensure that there are processes in place to ensure that additional expenditure is justifiable?  Overtime is necessary but there must be processes in place to prove that.<\/p><p>The information pack provided to us today shows that one garda earned &euro;76,000  in overtime.  Obviously, that is extraordinary and we understand that.  Once we know that the processes are in place to allow for elasticity, with the Department seeking supplementary budgets and so on, that is the key issue.

We are a growing organisation.  The budget is growing, as is the size of the organisation.  In overall numbers, our previous high point was in 2009.  When one adds Garda staff to the number of members of the force, we are now in excess of that high point.  We are as large as we have ever been and more expansion is planned.  It is for me to direct the priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  A lot of the overtime budget seems to get caught up in practices over which we have no discretion and that takes money away from the operational drive that I want from the overtime.  The 15-minute briefing time payment drains money from the overtime budget and effectively leaves us with between &euro;72 million and &euro;73 million for overtime.  That is considerably less flexibility than we had in 2017 in respect of budgets.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the documentation compares us with other jurisdictions but with respect, in other jurisdictions the police services no longer take on some of the duties which still fall very squarely on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and take up our overtime budget.  I refer to things like garda&iacute; escorting prisoners to and from courts, a practice which has been largely eradicated in other jurisdictions.  We are facing enormous pressures in terms of serious criminality and are having to supplement our policing effort to prevent serious crime.  At the moment, we obviously have a very difficult issue in terms of ongoing, vicious drug feuds.  In that context, it is up to me and members of my senior team to review how we are spending our money and determine whether it could be better spent.  We need to decide if things could be done differently or in a way which would not actually cost as much or consume as much overtime.  That is not just about things that we think we could divest ourselves of responsibility for but also the manner in which we take on other operations and adopting a different profile in respect of those.  There is a hierarchy of priorities in terms of how we spend our money.  We have to focus on serious criminality, particularly where lives are in danger and there is serious risk of harm.<\/p> <p>  The deputy Garda commissioner is engaged in a project at the moment involving a deep analysis of where our overtime budget is going.

Having looked through this, I believe no public representative could fail to justify overtime that is necessary to protect people.  It is demand led.  We cannot sit here and say otherwise.  On the other side of the fence, we would say, \"Lads, why are ye not doing something about all this?\"  This is about the process of accountability.  I refer to the management information system Mr. Harris mentioned.  Divestment, civilianisation of certain components, and IT also jump out very much.  There seems to be a great deficiency in IT.  This is a message to go back to the Department.  We have seen this previously.  Capital investment in IT will result in multiple efficiencies and savings down the road and result in greater outcomes.  Take, for instance, the normal Garda sergeant or inspector affected by this.

Someone might come back to me with that clarification and I will continue on if the committee does not mind.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to the Galway station, in which I would have a particular interest, and the Kevin Street Garda station, where we have a very new and welcome Garda station.  I will not go in a parochial direction on this but there were significant changes and significant costs.  As with the national children's hospital and lots of other projects, why was this not foreseen?  Page 15 informs us that amendments were made to the original design that required structural works and in addition, there were other design changes to meet requirements of the Garda and so on.  Could somebody come back with a note on this? Was there a competitive procurement process in the beginning?  What happened after that and what was the cost increase?  I am thinking of the children's hospital situation where a price was given and then changed.  It appears that some issues can arise in a project but it depends on what the changes are, why they were not foreseen and why elements were not included in the original design.  A passing comment on this is that I have no idea why the Galway station came out so close to the road.  I could not let this pass without making a comment on it.

Last September, I moved to Ireland from Manchester and I am privileged to have taken up the role as CEO of Ulster Bank.  I have worked in financial services for almost 39 years in a variety of roles, including in retail, corporate, operations and risk management.  In my previous post, at the Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, I was managing director of NatWest and RBS personal banking, where I was responsible for leading the team for the day-to-day banking needs of approximately 15 million customers throughout the UK.<\/p> <p>  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley, chief financial officer and deputy CEO, and Mr. Ciaran Coyle, managing director of personal banking.  In the invitation letter, the committee expressed an interest in Brexit preparedness and the accountability framework for the banking sector, which I will cover in my opening statement. <\/p> <p>  I begin by providing some insights into the progress we are making in Ulster Bank.  Our strategy is to continue to leverage our parent and to build a stronger, safe and sustainable bank, offering high-tech and high-touch solutions to provide effortless everyday banking services that our customers value, and to be there for them for what matters to them.  We believe that a blend of digital and physical banking is the winning combination because our customers tell us that is what they want and value.  To support our strategy, we continue to focus on innovation.  We have expanded our partnership with Dogpatch Labs, a leading co-working space for technology start-ups.  Some of our colleagues are developing their entrepreneurial talent and creativity to deliver innovative solutions for our customers.  We recently co-hosted a fifth annual Hackathon, a weekend which brought together members of the community, including the tech community, to design innovative banking solutions for customers. <\/p> <p>Underpinning, and fundamental to, our strategy is the continuation of transforming our culture to one where customers are consistently at the heart of everything we do, served and supported by professional colleagues. <\/p> <p>  Since Ulster Bank&rsquo;s previous appearance before the committee, we have made tangible progress on our priorities.  In respect of lending to support our customers and the economy, a core part of our strategy is to help our personal customers to buy a home and to save money by switching to lower rates.  This aligns with our investment to improve the service and offer market-leading fixed rates.  Last year, we saw a 13% increase in new mortgage lending to &euro;1.13 billion.  That momentum has continued into this year.  We also lent approximately &euro;1.4 billion to our business customers and, with a good start to 2019, we expect that figure to grow this year.  Our Lombard asset finance business saw volumes increase by more than 40%, or almost &euro;200 million of new lending.  We were conscious that 2018 was a particularly challenging year for the agrifood sector and introduced a weather fund to support customers in a year of unprecedented weather events.  We expanded our relationship with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland through its Brexit loan scheme and joined the BGF backers for businesses.  We also intend to participate in the new future growth loan scheme. <\/p> <p>  We continue to see more customers change the way they bank.  Today, seven out of ten active personal current account customers choose to bank using digital channels and in the first quarter of this year, we have seen a 31% increase in mobile payments and transfers compared with quarter 1 2018.  We are listening to what our customers want from us and innovating to make our customer experience effortlessly everyday and brilliant when it matters.<\/p><p>In the past year, we have introduced new applications and services such as: ClearSpend, which gives businesses better control of their expenses; Manage my Mortgage for our residential mortgage customers, enabling them to make changes to their mortgage online and from the comfort of their home; and Cora, our new artificial intelligence-driven digital banking assistant to help answer customer queries 24-7 every day of the year.  We have also been adding more features such as FaceID and paperless processes for our everyday banking products, making the digital experience simpler and more secure for customers.<\/p><p> As I mentioned, our strategy is both high-tech and high-touch.  We have invested in our physical presence, expanded our mortgage broker panel and increased the number of mobile mortgage managers across the country, offering flexible meeting times and locations, chosen by our customers.  We have five mobile banks, a community protection adviser and our team of community bankers.  We are continuously improving our branch network and 41 branches have seen investment.  We plan more this year.  New needs arise for our customers and last year we launched Friends Against Scams.  We are committed to playing our part in the fight against fraud so we trained colleagues across the bank.  We are educating customers on how to protect themselves against the horrific practices of scams which, when they happen, can impact consumers and our customers so badly.<\/p><p> Since our previous appearance before the committee, we have made progress on reducing our non-performing loans, NPLs, which stand at just over 10% of the total, but there is more to do.  Our regulators have set out capital requirements for NPLs and those requirements mean that over the coming years we will need to increase the capital we hold up to a point where we will have to hold enough capital for the full amount of the non-performing loan.  That capital is then tied up and we cannot use it to support loan growth which would contribute to the Irish economy.  To be clear, our priority is to work with our customers to put in place long-term sustainable arrangements so that as many customers as possible can remain in their home and paying off their mortgage.  We have invested in additional resources to ensure that every customer has every opportunity to engage with us to enter into a long-term solution.  We have found that when customers have worked with us, a solution can be found for four out of five, meaning they can remain in their homes.<\/p><p> We have also made significant progress on our customer remediation programmes to put right our wrongs of the past and learn from our mistakes.  We completed a thorough process to identify all impacted tracker mortgage customers and we do not anticipate any new or additional impacted upon groups of tracker customers to emerge at this point.  We have made redress and compensation payments to all tracker mortgage examination customers for whom we have contact details.  The thorough review identified other issues relating to errors on the accounts of business and mortgage customers that we will have resolved by the middle of this year and end of this year respectively.  Let me take the opportunity now, as this is my first time in front of the committee, to sincerely apologise for our past mistakes and the impact they had on our customers.<\/p><p> Turning to Brexit, the subject is top of mind for many customers, although many of our business customers tell us also that shortages of both skilled and unskilled labour is a bigger issue.  Supporting our customers is a top priority and we continue to do this, first, by communicating what we can do to support them to understand the impacts of Brexit and, second, drawing to their attention all the Government and agency supports available, which are excellent.  We see different types of businesses that can adapt and which are adapting.  Many are well-prepared and have sound contingency plans.  There are particular challenges for some customers who export to the UK or who use the UK as a land bridge to the European market.  Where additional resources and guarantees are required in respect of customs and tariffs, for example, we are ready to support our customers.<\/p><p> We continue to monitor the impact of the UK decision to leave the European Union on the bank and our customers and have been preparing for a number of scenarios, including a no-deal position, as part of our contingency planning as a stand-alone bank and as part of RBS.  There has been no material impact noted to date; however we are conscious of the potential for future impacts on the bank, our customers and our operations.  A bank-wide Brexit response programme has been mobilised to assess those impacts and to develop contingencies under a number of Brexit scenarios to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers well.  Regardless of the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, our aim is to support customers with the same level of service and range of products as we do today and to help them address any related challenges.<\/p><p> The committee also asked me to address the topic of the accountability framework.  I welcome the introduction of the senior executive accountability regime and I know from my experience in the UK how such a regime can make a difference to promoting stronger accountability, ethics and culture in financial services.  Increased accountability will be better for our customers and for society as a whole and while a senior executive accountability regime alone will not transform culture within the banking industry, it will help.<\/p><p> I will finish on the topic of culture.  Much has been said about banking culture at this committee and at other fora in recent times.  We in Ulster Bank have learned many lessons.  We got things wrong and we are fixing mistakes from the past and learning from them.  We are absolutely committed to rebuilding trust with our customers and Irish society.  We recognise we have much to do and we are changing.  We are making different decisions today from those we may have made in the past.<\/p><p> In Ulster Bank we have defined our culture as \"the way we do things\" and it is consistently living our values to act in the best interests of our customers, colleagues and stakeholders.  Our four core values &ndash; serving customers, working together, doing the right thing and thinking for the long term &ndash; guide our priorities, activities and decision making.  We have strengthened our risk and control environment to reduce the possibility of errors occurring.  We are building a customer-focused culture where colleagues are encouraged to help customers be financially fitter and to speak up if and when see things that might look wrong or if they have any concerns.  Tone from the top is something I and my leadership team are conscious of every day.  This is one of the reasons I have personally committed to completing the Institute of Bankers professional diploma in leading cultural change and ethical behaviours in financial services and sitting on the Irish Banking Culture Board.<\/p><p> I am pleased to report we have made progress over the past 12 months across our customer, operational and financial metrics, along with the continued execution of our strategy to transform Ulster Bank.  We are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019050900002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557356400,"counter":673,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Howard on what is her first appearance before the committee as chief executive.  I wish her well and every success, although I know she is well settled into her role at this stage.  I welcome her colleagues, Mr. Paul Stanley and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Coyle, and I thank the witnesses for the comprehensive responses to the questionnaire we received in advance of the meeting.  I also thank Ms Howard for her opening statement.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the matter of NPLs and the work that must be done to reduce non-performing loan ratios.  The opening statement indicates the current NPLs level is just over 10% and it is acknowledged in the replies in section 4 of the questionnaire that the regulators expect banks to reduce the level of NPLs towards the European average and have set out capital requirements that must be adhered to in respect of those loans.  Will Ms Howard outline her understanding as chief executive of where it must go in terms of the NPLs ratio, when it needs to do this and how it intends to get there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019050900002#D00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557356400,"counter":674,"content":"<p>There is not a specific target set by the European Central Bank but it is clear that any bank with NPLs in excess of a 5% level is regarded as having a high number of NPLs.  The banks are expected to have a plan to reduce those towards the European average.  We have seen that European average reduce more recently to between 3% and 3.4%.  That is sound risk management for any bank.  Although we do not have a specific target, we absolutely understand our commitment to reduce our level of NPLs.<\/p> <p>  As the Deputy notes, we have made progress.  The last time representatives of the bank were before the committee, the level was approximately 17% and it is currently 10.3%.  It is important that I highlight our first priority, which is to help customers with a non-performing loan - a mortgage - to get into a long-term and sustainable solution.<\/p><p>Accordingly, we have always contacted customers who are in arrears.<\/p><p> We have also committed additional resources to ensure that we can contact all of our customers who are in a non-performing status so that they can engage with us and we can help as many of them as possible.  We have employed additional resources because the economy is stronger, unemployment is at a lower rate of just under 5%, many of our customers who are in a non-performing status have higher available incomes and house prices have increased significantly.  Against that background, we have found that when customers fully engage with us, which includes completing a standard financial statement, we can offer a long-term solution to four out of five customers that keeps them in their homes.  Sadly, we cannot find a long-term solution for one in five customers who engage with us that keeps them in their homes.  It is almost an impossible situation.  In such circumstances, we work with the customers on an individual basis and examine other options.  These might include mortgage-to-rent or a voluntary surrender.<\/p><p> Our priority is to help customers, but we need to reduce our number of NPLs.  While there is no target, there is an expectation that we reduce them.  We believe that is right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019050900002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Jane Howard","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557356400,"counter":676,"content":"<p>The bank's current rate in respect of NPLs is 10.3%.  We have heard from a number of other banks that they have attached particular significance to the end of this year.  Has that been communicated to Ulster Bank?  Is there a figure it needs to reach or is there pressure on it to reduce the number of its NPLs significantly by year end?  That would most likely only be achieved by way of a step change reduction through a portfolio sale.  Ulster Bank has already undertaken portfolio sales, but that type of sale is controversial.  While the Central Bank, the Department and bank CEOs always tell this committee that protections travel with the loan and the mortgage contract remains unchanged, we have also heard from the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, which have outlined a number of specific instances where they felt that customers were disadvantaged when their loans were sold on.  The most significant change is the change in attitude.  While Ulster Bank may make every endeavour to reach a restructuring arrangement with a borrower, the same may not hold true for the fund that purchases the loan because that fund takes a much shorter-term view regarding the loan's return.  Is there an onus on Ulster Bank to reduce its NPL rate further this year?  If so, are further loan portfolio sales on the table and actively under consideration?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019050900002#E00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557356400,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I might start and Mr. Stanley might wish to add something afterwards.

It will principally comprise PDHs because most of our non-performing buy-to-lets are effectively gone at this stage.  The key for us is working with our customers on trying to find out whether, due to the points that Ms Howard has mentioned, there are long-term sustainable solutions for them.

Has the bank promoted it sufficiently?  It is a two-year offer, so it is not long term.  At the time, however, it was by some distance the lowest rate on the market.  I believe it still is the lowest even though others are coming closer to it.  I had hoped that it would start something of a price war in mortgages, although our guests might not have welcomed that.

We are finding that more than 80% of the new mortgages that we are writing today are on the fixed rate.  Customers tell us that they like the rate and that it gives them certainty of payment.  The latter is important to our customers.

The Deputy is right about the two-year fixed rate.  We also have the lowest four-year fixed rate in the marketplace.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we have seen good momentum in the business.  I will help the committee to understand what we have done.  For nearly a year, we have had an extensive marketing campaign across media - outdoors, radio, cinema, etc.  Judging by our marketing team and market analysis, this has had the exact level of impact that we wanted.  In recent months, we invested in and launched a new online portal to make it easier than ever for customers to switch to the new rate.  If an existing customer is on a variable or fixed rate, he or she can go online from the comfort of home and change to any of our new rates in a matter of minutes, 24 hours per day, when it would previously have taken a couple of weeks.<\/p> <p>  Regarding performance, when we last appeared before the committee, we mentioned that our natural stock in this market was approximately 14%.  We were slightly behind that figure then.  At the end of the first quarter of this year, though, we had a drawdown market share of over 16% and our approvals were slightly higher than that.  To build on Ms Howard's point, we are hearing from our customers that they like the clarity and certainty regarding what they pay.  Effectively, rates remain important to our customers.  We are making other changes beyond the rates to make the process of coming to us easier and faster.

We have information that Cerberus and Cabot, which is the servicing agent employed by Cerberus, are taking a very strong approach to the bank's previous buy-to-let customers.  They are appointing fixed asset receivers and giving former customers 30 days to clear all of their arrears or they will appoint fixed asset receivers.  The bank has employed two fixed asset receivers.  Deputy Michael McGrath is right, and we are saying this over and over again, that it is not about the protections that travel with the customer and the mortgage, it is the attitude.  The bank has appointed two fixed asset receivers.  The vulture is taking a policy decision to tell customers to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will put in place fixed asset receivers.  Does the bank have anything to say on this?  It has hung out it customers high and dry.  It has fed them to these vultures.<\/p> <p>  The bank knows fine well these were non-performing loans.  That does not mean they were not being paid, it means the customers were not able to pay the full amount and that they were in arrears.  The idea of any bank telling people to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will take its property is absolute madness.  That is what Ulster Bank has done to almost 2,200 customers who have tenants.  When fixed asset receivers are appointed, those tenants will be evicted.  That is what is happening here.<\/p> <p>  I have a letter from Cabot to a mortgage holder that states Cabot has noted there are arrears owing on an account mortgage - in the number and amount of X - and to assist the person in clearing these the following payment options are available but the letter then just gives the IBAN and BIC details of the bank.  The letter then states that failure to contact the office on receipt of the letter and clear the arrears in full within 30 calendar days from the date of the letter will leave Cabot no other option but to appoint a receiver over the secured property.<\/p><p>I can read Ms Howard other letters where former customers of Ulster Bank with multiple properties are in positive equity and are trying to sell the loans, but Cabot is saying \"No\".  They are willing to sell the properties and pay off the full amount but Cabot is saying it does not care.  It is telling them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will appoint a fixed asset receiver.<\/p><p> We are told this is now policy within the vulture funds to which Ulster Bank handed its customer accounts, yet the bank has washed its hands and said it has nothing to do with it any more.  N&aacute;ire - shame on it for what it has done.  We warned it that this was going to happen.  This is what vultures do.  Has Ulster Bank no regard for people who made the bank profitable during good times and who are finding it difficult to make full repayments?  They are looking for a bit of time or support but are definitely not looking for this type of attitude.  In fairness, it is an attitude that Ulster Bank would not show to its customers.<\/p><p> How many buy-to-let customers does the bank have?  Can Ms Howard imagine her bank writing to customers tomorrow morning to tell them to clear their arrears within 30 days or it will repossess their homes?  People would take their accounts from the bank overnight and they would say they are having nothing to do with that.  However, the bank outsources its dirty work to the vultures and it is about to do it again.  Shame on it.  That is why we need this committee to pass my legislation, which will put in place a statutory responsibility to do what Ulster Bank should do anyway, that is, live up to the standards of the Central Bank, which says it should ask for permission before it sells to a vulture.  I ask Ms Howard for a response on how Ulster Bank has treated its customers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2019050900002#G03200","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1557356400,"counter":767,"content":"<p>The Deputy referred to the future loan sale.

The Senator referred to the ATM fee.  If a person wants to take money out through an ATM then it is a lesser charge of 35 cent.

If someone chooses to use the chip and pin payment, a direct debit or a standing order it is 20 cent.  The Senator also commented on our contactless payment charge, which is 1 cent.  The cost to us of effecting a contactless payment is not materially different from a person paying with chip and pin, but we recognise that in the market more and more people are using contactless payments for transactions under &euro;30.  It is quicker for customers and better for retailers.  We want to encourage that.  We give the contactless charge at a more discounted rate because we can see this is where the market trend is going.  On our overall fees versus those of our competitors, as Ms Howard has said I cannot comment on the cost base of our competitors and what their commercial decisions are.

The results here are lower in terms of consumers trusting banks.

What that did at a senior level was to make peoples' accountabilities and responsibilities very clear.  The current plan is for that to be introduced here in the first quarter of next year at the executive level.  It will also extend to board members, which it does not do in the UK, so we will go further here in Ireland than in the UK.<\/p> <p>  Culture is everything we do all the way from strategy down to how we serve the customer.  It is the way I behave, and the way the executive team behaves.  It is what we do and what we do not do.
