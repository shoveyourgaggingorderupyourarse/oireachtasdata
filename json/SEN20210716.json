Since we mark today what is more than likely our last day sitting in this Chamber and the start of the recess, noting that everybody's work in committees and elsewhere will continue, I want to take the opportunity, on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to thank Mr. Martin Groves and all the staff for their unfailing courtesy over the past year.  It has been a difficult year for everybody.  I thank the members of the Opposition and of other parties and none for their collaboration throughout the year.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his courtesy and his non-partisanship in chairing the proceedings.  I thank the Leader for her inspirational leadership.  She has done her utmost to secure any debate requested on any side of the House.  We are all proud of her leadership in this House.<\/p><p>It is important to mention the number of new Covid cases announced yesterday.  The number spiralled quickly.  The notion of personal responsibility comes to the fore strongly in that there is only so much the State can do and only so much that can be done through vaccination.  It is great to see the portal opening for those aged over 25 but we all have to take personal responsibility as we proceed.<\/p><p>I wish Senator Hoey the best of luck.  She is getting married today.  I believe it is her third attempt.  Everyone will join me in wishing her health and happiness on her big day.<\/p><p>I took the opportunity to join the demonstration outside the convention centre on the use of peat in the horticulture industry.  It included everyone from nursery workers and mushroom farmers to strawberry farmers.  Senator Boyhan has raised this frequently in the House, as have I.  It is beyond me how nothing has been done to try to resolve the problem given that growers and so much of our employment, food and food security are dependent on peat.  Those affected have no option but to import horticultural peat from Lithuania and Holland at a great cost to the environment and at a great financial cost.  Responsibility extends across four Departments.  It needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p>We had a long debate on Jadotville last night so I do not intend to raise the matter again.  Suffice it to say that there was a high level of respect for members of our Defence Forces.  An article in the <i>The Irish Times<\/i>today states the number of patrol days cancelled by the Naval Service this year is already four times greater than the number for 2020.  A total of 148 days were lost in the first five months of the year.  This shines a light again on how those within our Defence Forces are treated in terms of employment conditions and salaries.  Something needs to be done about it soon.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#B00100","speaker":"1689"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":10,"content":"<p>On behalf of Fine Gael, I thank the Cathaoirleach.

I am referring to all the back-and-forth and late nights.

I also thank Senator Gallagher, assistant Government Whip.<\/p> <p>One of the most frustrating things in politics is the time it takes to deliver projects.  In this regard, we can all list a thousand projects we have been involved with over years.  This day week, I will welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to Galway to turn the sod on the PorterShed development on Market Street.  It is a co-working innovation space over two levels.  Funding has been granted to fit it out and do associated works.  This project has been ongoing since 2018.  It is great to see it being delivered.  PorterShed started on the Ceannt Station grounds in Galway as an innovation hub.  It has been a great success.  It has encouraged start-ups, supported job creation and attracted significant investment to the west.  It received support from the Government under the regional enterprise development fund.  It is great to see the project coming to fruition.  The PorterShed has to move to a new location to facilitate the development of lands at Ceannt Station, which is part of a strategic site within Galway city.  There is to be a new development there.<\/p> <p>I have raised on several occasions the issue of planning and requested a debate thereon.  Perhaps that can be prioritised in September.

We had bad news during the week with the refusal of planning permission for the P&aacute;irc na Mara development at Cill Chiar&aacute;in, Connemara, an area that is crying out for jobs.  It is an unemployment blackspot.  The day of the refusal was a dark day.  I hope there will be an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is part of the long process of getting anything built and developed in this country.  My concern is that the problem is getting worse, which will deter Irish and foreign investors.  Therefore, we need to prioritise planning in the autumn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#B00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the way he has conducted his business over the past year.

I thank Mr. Martin Groves, our clerk, and his staff for the way they keep us on track.  Without them, I do not know where any of us would be.  I ask Mr. Groves to tell his staff that we really appreciate them, the staff of the Bills Office and, more important, the greater Oireachtas family.  We have ushers here.  We have security people and people who clean these offices every day.  We have many support-team staff.  There are staff from the Office of Public Works who keep this building and these grounds.  Sometimes they are forgotten.  Politicians are great at talking about themselves, what they want and their hurts but it is important to remember there are many people in the big Oireachtas family.  I acknowledge them for the role they play in keeping the light burning and this place open for us.<\/p> <p>I want to be positive as we finish our term but I would like to put down an indicator of concern for the Leader concerning how we do our business in this House.  We have talked about Seanad reform, enhancement and renewal.  Opposition Members are not very many, as the Leader knows, and the Government has the numbers.  The Government Members do not even have to be here every day; we all know that.  We know the numbers, we know the position on votes, and we know the records.  That is not a criticism of anybody because many who are not in this House are at this very moment in their offices doing work.  Others are in committee rooms during committee business.  I understand, appreciate and acknowledge that but it is important to remember that there will come a time when some people on the other side of the House will be on this side.  I spoke to some Green Party Members recently.  We remembered when they sat at the back and got no look in.  We all have an equal and democratic mandate to represent the people who elect us.  I suggest, on a positive note, that we need to sit down and examine how we are doing our business.  That is important.  Everyone has a voice, experience and something to add value to the proceedings of the House.  I realise the Leader respects that but I just wanted to say it.<\/p> <p>I wish the Taoiseach and Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage well as they open, at 2 o'clock this afternoon, a housing scheme under Tuath Housing in partnership with D&uacute;n Laoghaire&ndash;Rathdown County Council.

I wish the British and Irish Lions rugby team well during its trip to South Africa.  It is the &ldquo;British and Irish Lions&rdquo; and not just the &ldquo;British Lions&rdquo;.  This is an example of how our two islands have come together under a sporting banner and displayed all that is good and positive in our celebration of commonalities.<\/p><p>Having said that, I received a communication of great concern yesterday from a person in my area.

I am reaching out to you as a thankful South African who has had the privilege of living in beautiful Clane for almost two years.<br \/><br \/>Today I address you on behalf of the South African community whose very Constitution and Bill of Rights was drafted in Dublin some twenty years ago.<br \/><br \/>The situation in South Africa is [currently] volatile and desperate, streets are littered with the remnants of looting and the mayhem that has taken place since Sunday across parts of [our beautiful] country.<br \/><br \/>Factories have been burnt to the ground and food supply chains have been cut. <br \/><br \/>The police and army are not equipped to deal with the current lawlessness.<br \/><br \/>Whilst the smouldering buildings have captured the skylines, South Africans from all walks of life are standing shoulder to shoulder to protect their communities and what is left of the economy.<br \/><br \/>The next couple of days is crucial and will cement South Africa&rsquo;s future.<br \/><br \/>My hope is to spread the word about what is really going on, it is not racially motivated but a political attempt to overthrow the current government, to avoid the prosecution of corrupt officials who [have], at long last, [been] brought to book.  <br \/><br \/>Sadly the communities that will be most affected are the...communities who have fought so tirelessly for democracy.<br \/><br \/>Please [please] can you shine a light on this issue.   <\/blockquote> <p>I am very pleased and honoured to shine a light on those concerns.  We have a great deal in common with South Africa.  My uncle, Fr. Gabriel Finnegan, is one of the many priests from this country who have continued to devote most of their adult lives to South Africa, including during those difficult days of apartheid.  I am shining a light, therefore, on something which has not received the publicity it ought to have.<\/p><p>Turning to another subject, I read with delight that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFine Gael is expected to open a Northern Ireland branch by [the] autumn and will try to find common ground with other &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; political parties in the region.  [This] move comes after a motion was passed at [its] ard fheis...Dublin Rathdown TD Neale Richmond said the party&rsquo;s move would &ldquo;widen Fine Gael&rsquo;s political role&rdquo; across the island.  &ldquo;Over the last couple of years, we&rsquo;ve had a proactive [presence in] Northern Ireland...which has really bought into the shared island initiative&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>I would never tell other parties what to do.  When a party makes a move like that, however, for the normalisation of politics I commend it as a public representative.  Well done to Fine Gael for taking that step.

The moderate voice will grow and will win someday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#C00200","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>As this is our last day, I extend my thanks to the Cathaoirleach for the way in which he has conducted proceedings throughout the year.  I express the appreciation of all the members of our Sinn F&eacute;in group in that regard.  Equally, I extend my gratitude to the Leader.  While it is fair to say that we do not agree a lot of the time, the approach she has taken has always been constructive.  It is worthy of recognition and I appreciate it.  I again express that sentiment on behalf of our entire group.  Most importantly, I thank all the staff of the Seanad, particularly Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and their team.  I also thank the team in the Leader&rsquo;s office, Orla Murray and all her colleagues.  It has been an especially challenging year for them.  It has especially been so in the last couple of weeks, given the amount of legislation and the number of late nights which have resulted.  It is important to put that on record on the record.<\/p><p>I also give a shout-out to the IT staff.  I do not know about the rest of the Members of the House, but when I have been working from home the people in the IT department have come to my rescue on more than one occasion.  I also thank the people who film us every day.  I will bring in one disappointing note that not everyone may be aware of.  The people working on filming lose their jobs every summer.  They do not have permanent jobs.  They are let go and rehired again.  We must address, as a group, the idea that we have people employed on precarious contracts working in this building.  It is completely unacceptable.  I ask for all-party support to address this aspect.  I also wish Senator Annie Hoey well on her big day.  I extend my good wishes to everybody in the Chamber.  While we have had a fair degree of debate, I hope that everybody appreciates that it has always been political and never personal.  That is the approach of the Sinn F&eacute;in team and the approach of everybody in this Chamber.  That is the way it must be.<\/p><p>In the time I have left, I raise a concern for when we return.  The Leader will be aware that there has been a fair degree of concern about the directly-elected mayor of Limerick.  To be frank, there seems to be cross-party recognition that the role now is not what it should be.  It appears that it will be a role which will be very expensive and have little power and responsibility.  All the power seems to be directed towards the new role of director general, a role which will attract pay of no less than &euro;171,000 a year.  The people of Limerick voted for a directly-elected mayor.  They want that mayor to have the powers to tackle key issues like housing, transport and planning for our city&rsquo;s future.  Unfortunately, those powers are not there now.  It is, of course, in the Government&rsquo;s gift to grant them.  It is an extremely important issue because other cities are going to look to Limerick to see how this initiative works out.  If we end up not releasing those powers from central government, then it will be a disappointment not just for the people of Limerick but for the future of direct local democracy.  Therefore, I ask for a debate on this issue.<\/p><p>Turning to the later debate on the Health (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2021, the one area which concerns me is that enough thought does not seem to have been given to the front-line workers and the young workers, in particular, as we reopen.  For the most part, they are unvaccinated.  It does not seem that enough thought has been given to this aspect.  It was hugely disappointing to see that those young workers and their unions were completely excluded from those talks with the hospitality sector.  I direct people to an excellent article in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>today by Denis Cotter.  He takes a strong line against the hospitality lobbyists, whom he feels did not represent many small businesses.  There is something to be said for that argument.  Above all, however, I ask that we bear in mind the vulnerability of our young workers labouring on the front line of hospitality.  As we reopen, proper thought does not seem to have been given to how we are going to protect those people.<\/p><p>Again, I thank everyone and I wish everyone well for the summer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#C00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I extend our best wishes to Senator Norris and we hope he will be back in full health in the autumn and in here with us.

It is shocking to think that thousands of people are still unaccounted for as a result of the flooding that has taken place there.  I do not know the exact causes of it but it is yet another reminder of how fragile our environment, built and natural, is and the vital need to protect, sustain and support it.<\/p><p>I will raise the issue of yesterday's High Court decision overturning An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision to grant planning permission for a medically supervised injection facility at Merchants Quay in Dublin.  I understand there are genuinely held concerns about a supervised injection centre.  There is a school in the area in question.  I am a mother of three small children and I get the need to try to protect and shield young children from what happens on our streets.  However, the point of a supervised centre is to take people from the streets and bring them to a place that is safe and that will save lives.  It is uncomfortable for many people when we talk about addiction, particularly drug addiction.  There is a real sense of it being \"over there\" but addiction is in all our communities, not just in Dublin but throughout the country.  I pay particular tribute to 2FM's Louise McSharry for her very powerful post yesterday because she talked about her family and the fact that addiction is not just somewhere else but is within people's families.  <\/p><p>My colleague, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, expressed strong concern yesterday that the HSE does not have a plan B for this issue.  We understand a mobile unit for supervised injection centres is not planned and that lives could be lost.  We need the Department of Health and the HSE to substantively respond in the wake of this High Court decision because it is a major setback in looking after those who suffer from addiction in this country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#C00400","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I was also very disappointed by the decision regarding the supervised injection facility.  A plan B is urgently needed.  However, I note that while we may be disappointed by that High Court decision, as others may be about other decisions, it is also very important that, regardless of our feelings on the matter, we recognise the independence of, and checks and balances within, our judicial and planning systems.  I say that in the context of the many statements we hear that the system needs to change.  That system is part of a democracy.  It is very difficult and we will often be disappointed by specific decisions but those are battles that we then need to win in the narrative, in engaging with people and in producing alternatives.  It is important that as part of the architecture of democracy in the State, we bear in mind the importance of that independent judicial system.  That is not to compromise anybody who will speak about this matter but to remind us of that fact as we go into the autumn.  On the importance of our planning architecture, I will say the same thing I always say, which is that policy is about the decisions we make and how we live together.  Part of that decision-making structure is citizens' involvement in the planning process.<\/p><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for an imaginative and ambitious chairing of this Chamber in a very difficult year.  He is still finding new ways to bring the Seanad forward.  I thank the Leader for a very fair and strong engagement with all of us.

I join the calls for fair conditions for those who work in, and with, this House, including the broadcasting unit and our secretarial assistants.<\/p><p>In the past year, we have very often dealt with matters that connected with the challenges of the day, week, month and the present moment.  That is what happens in a crisis.  However, when we come back in the autumn we will need to look to the future.  While we have all been battling the changing landscape around Covid and its immediate challenges, the bigger discussion is about what happens next and what kind of island and Europe we will have next.  All over the country, discussions are taking place locally about what kind of city, town or community we want to have.  Those are very important discussions that will need to be centre stage, be they on climate, housing or reimagining care and our public services.  I hope that in the autumn we will be able to turn our minds towards putting a stamp on the discussion about what the future should be.  If we do not do so, we will find that it has already been tied up and decided and may again be more of the same.  It is very important that we keep that transformative thinking and put an imprint on it.  <\/p><p>I am very honoured to represent this House and Parliament in Europe as part of the future of Europe initiative, which involves parliamentarians from each national parliament discussing with citizens, and others, what the future of Europe should be.  It is important that not just parliamentarians but everyone and, indeed, all the citizens of Ireland should have an input into discussions on the future of Europe.  I call on people to engage and submit ideas on the <i>europa.eu <\/i>website so they are part of the discussion on shaping the places in which they will live.  I urge all Members, as parliamentarians, to take a moment to look, think and add their very good ideas too.  <\/p><p>My final point is on an issue that will shape what kind of world we come back to in the autumn.  It is the decision that will be made on 27 July and whether Ireland will be one of a tiny handful of countries that will stop the temporary sharing of intellectual property to allow a scaling up of vaccine manufacture and access.  The vulnerable should not be set against workers and businesses.  Everybody benefits if we scale up vaccine manufacturing and, crucially, millions of lives around the world may be saved if we do so.  I ask that Ireland will not be one of the few countries that will go down in history as unnecessarily prolonging this global pandemic by one or two years.  That decision will be made on 27 July.  I hope that Ireland does the right thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#D00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I join with Members in thanking Martin, Bridget, Carmel, Ilinca, Ethan, Aisling and, of course, Grace in my office, and all the staff of the Oireachtas for their tireless work.

Senators Gavan and Higgins raised an issue relating to some of the staff who work in this House.  Our recording staff only contacted me in the last week.  I am not sure if some of the people in this House are aware that we as a State worked with RT&Eacute; as a State operator in the last number of years to conduct an internal audit of all of its staff going back for decades.  A tremendous number of those people, who were independently employed in RT&Eacute;, had to be given retrospective contracts, employment rights and PRSI.  Tax liabilities had to be paid to the State on behalf of RT&Eacute; for a significant number of employers who were deemed not to be self-employed contractors but actually employees of RT&Eacute;.  It is about time we did exactly the same thing in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I will ask the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to conduct a survey of all those it would call \"casual\" staff in these Houses.  We rely on them day in, day out.  They are the people behind the screens and behind our boxes.  I do not mean that an individual recording this is casually employed.  It is not good enough that a State employer, which is exactly what RT&Eacute; was and what we are in these Houses, treats people in such an insignificant manner.  That is something that we should do and I will write to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission on their behalf.  I acknowledge the Senators' persistence in this area.  I know they are dedicated to it, as we all are.<\/p> <p>Senator Sherlock brought up the High Court decision yesterday.  I know that we are all supposed to be incredibly careful about the separation of powers and I will be.  It bloody well shows that we still have significant stigma about a medical condition and medical treatment in this country.  I would call it arrogance but maybe it is ignorance of people who genuinely still believe that addiction only happens to certain people in certain communities of a certain type.  In fact, the vast majority of people who suffer from addiction are the hidden people in every single town and community that we live in and we either choose to ignore them or just not acknowledge them.  Yesterday's decision was an awful shame.  The Senator is right that we need the HSE to step up to give us plan B.  It should not be something that we plan for in three years or five years but something that we plan for in three weeks or three months.  I acknowledge the Senator's contribution.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin raised the solidarity in sport that we often see.  I thank him for his good wishes for our attempts to open a branch.  We have had one in Ulster University for a year or so now and it is going well.  This is a new adventure for us and I hope it goes well, not for political purposes but for integration, co-operation and sharing ideas.<\/p> <p>Senator Boyhan talked about Seanad reform.  I thank him for acknowledging that I try to be as co-operative as I can.  I hope that we do not ever use our majority.  It is there but it is irrelevant.  We should all use our co-operative skills in this House to try to get legislation passed.  It is testament to the fact that there is not politicking in this Chamber that we can get our business done and start at 9 a.m. and have a late night be 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.  The politicking that goes on in the other House is why they are there until 3 a.m.  Maybe they have much to learn from us.  We acknowledge that we are using the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I thank Senator Boyhan for his co-operation over the last months.<\/p> <p>Senators Kyne and Higgins talked about planning.  We will have a new process for fast-track planning and good planning.  All of the flaws that have been obvious to some Members and more obvious to some of us later in the day have been highlighted in the last couple of months.  I hope that we get a good new process.  I acknowledge Senator Boyhan's good wishes for the housing for all strategy, because we are all pinning our hopes on it delivering in the next couple of months.  It will be launched next week or the week after.<\/p> <p>Senator Kyne referred to the PorterShed development.  I am looking forward to many more of those types of organisations so that we can see remote working happening live and not in people's bedrooms, halls or landings.  It is good to see something happening live while we are still talking about remote working.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin talked about the peat harvesters who we met outside Convention Centre Dublin the other day.  This is an example of something that we are doing to try to reduce our carbon footprint resulting in an increase in our carbon footprint and bringing about something that we have all said we want to do away with, which is carbon leakage.  I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Minister because I think she is doing a wonderful job but doing another report for another year on something that we all see as plainly obvious is not the answer, so we need to do something far more specific and far sooner.<\/p> <p>I join with Members' good wishes in thanking our staff.  We do it this time every year or at Christmas.  It is not just that we acknowledge and appreciate them during those times.  There are some incredible and special people who work on this campus.  We are incredibly lucky to have them because their care, attention, empathy and concern for all of us is evident in the interaction that we have every day.  I acknowledge it and thank them sincerely.  We appreciate it.  It makes working in this environment much nicer than it otherwise would be.<\/p> <p>Darren Fitzgerald is one of the ushers.  I acknowledge a task that he has set himself.  If you look at his Instagram page, you will see that he has a little daughter.  She is only four.  She has cystic fibrosis.  I do not know if any Members know of his interest in golf but he is obviously a keen golfer.  He is doing 65 Holes for 65 Roses, which is an appeal by Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, so all sponsorship would be welcome.  I acknowledge and commend him on doing that.<\/p> <p>I wish our colleague, Senator Annie Hoey, and her new husband-to-be today every success and happiness.  The sun will shine on her today and hopefully it will for many years to come.<\/p> <p>I send our best wishes to Senator David Norris.  He obviously has not been around a lot in the last while.  He needs to protect and mind himself.  Hopefully he will be back to us in September, hale and hearty.<\/p> <p>I wish colleagues a good rest during the summer.  We will continue to do all the work that we always do during the recess.  It has been a trying year.  I know that we have grated on each other's nerves somewhat, especially some of the people who have been trying to keep us safe.  I know I have certainly grated on some of their nerves by trying to get back to normal.  Hopefully everybody will have a good rest and we will be back in our own Seanad Chamber in September.  I am looking forward to it.<\/p> <p>I know we can use the words \"I had the real privilege\" too often after we meet people.  I had the real privilege of meeting a remarkable woman yesterday, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.  For such a young woman to have the burden of the people of her country on her shoulders and to take it with such gusto and to have such an impressive campaign in the last general election in Belarus left me genuinely in awe of her.  I am much older than her but I pale in comparison.  She is a remarkable woman.  Today is the Day of Belarus Women's Solidarity.  She explained to me yesterday that the women in her country have held her up and have kept the resilience campaign in that country alive with the energy that it has.  I asked her how she did it.  She said that it is not that they have been given hope but that they have no choice but to fight for themselves, for their children and grandchildren because the alternative is accepting that all they will have if they do not fight is the dictator and Lukashenko's regime, which they live under every single day.  I was in awe when listening to her.  Some of us had the pleasure of meeting her yesterday.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the solidarity of all of us with the women of Belarus today.  We stand with them and with the political prisoners.  We hope, support and pray for them.  I do not say that to be facile, because the only way they will overthrow him is with real sanctions and clout from the EU.  We can offer solidarity, light our candles, stand beside them and hope that they get what they are working for daily, which is common decency and a normal standard of living with normal conditions and livelihoods.  They should be able to go to do a decent day's work and not have to live with the peril of having the KGB knock on the door and drag people out of their houses daily.  I acknowledge her visit.  She is a remarkable politician in this day and age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#E00100","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Leader for raising the issue of women's solidarity in Belarus.

In addition, there is a commitment to bring new homes, which are currently exempt from this tax, into the taxation system.  It is necessary to enact this legislation before the summer recess.  This is required to enable the Revenue Commissioners to make the essential technical and administrative preparations to implement the various changes to the LPT regime that are contained within the Bill before the valuation date of 1 November 2021.<\/p> <p>Ideally, legislation to give effect to reform of the local property tax would have been enacted in 2020.  However, the process leading to the formation of the Government, and finalisation of the programme for Government, took longer than anticipated.  Last year, our immediate focus was, appropriately, on the response to the Covid pandemic which meant there was not sufficient time to implement the LPT commitments during the remainder of 2020.  The Minister, therefore, deferred the revaluation date for local property tax of 1 November 2020 to 1 November of this year.<\/p> <p>The local property tax was introduced in 2013 and was designed to serve a dual function.  First, to provide a stable funding base for the local authority sector and incorporating appropriate elements of local authority responsibility.  It reinforces local democratic decision-making and encourages greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.  Second, the local property tax has broadened the tax base in a manner that does not directly impact on employment and has replaced some of the revenue from transaction-based taxes with an annual recurring property tax.<\/p> <p>Perhaps the most significant proposal in the Bill is a revised method for calculating LPT liabilities contained in section 24.  A key challenge encountered during both the work of the review of the tax in 2019 and the more recent analysis is the significant variation of property price increases geographically and, in particular, the uneven pace and rate of increases in residential property values throughout the country since the original valuation on 1 May 2013.  A guiding principle informing the design of the LPT is simplicity for taxpayers and Revenue, which collects the tax.  In that regard, the new basis for calculating LPT liabilities builds on the existing band structure and is a variation of one of the approaches examined in the 2019 LPT review, which was listed as scenario 5 in the report.<\/p> <p>The new approach will maintain the number of bands at 20.  Band 1 will be expanded from &euro;0 to &euro;200,000 and band 2 will contain valuations from &euro;200,000 to &euro;262,500.  The LPT charge will be fixed at the current charge for bands 1 and 2, which are &euro;90 and &euro;225, respectively.  The other bands will be widened by 75% to create bands of &euro;87,500, which will be increased from the current range of &euro;50,000, with a lower mid-point rate charged to maintain the existing broad structure.  Currently, a higher rate applies to properties valued at more than &euro;1 million, with the first &euro;1 million charged at 0.18% and everything in excess of that at the higher rate of 0.25%.  Properties are charged on a self-assessed valuation of the individual property.  Under the proposed approach, it is likely that owners of high value properties, that is, values of more than &euro;1 million, would benefit from reductions in LPT liability due to the widening of the bands and the reduced rate.  To address this, a higher rate will be applied to properties valued at more than &euro;1 million by charging it at a higher mid-point rate on bands above &euro;1.05 million - these are known as bands 12 to 19 - and introducing a third rate for properties valued at more than &euro;1.75 million.<\/p> <p>An important principle underlining the LPT is that by keeping the number of exemptions low, it helps to keep the tax rate low for those who are liable to pay it.  Sections 10, 13, 14 and 15 of the Bill accordingly provide that the exemptions for first-time buyers and homes in unfinished estates will lapse.  Section 16 provides that the current exemption in respect of pyrite-damaged properties will cease to apply for new applicants after the end of a two-year period following the enactment of this Bill.  Any taxpayer qualifying before that date may avail of the exemption.<\/p> <p>In relation to damaged properties, the Government has been very active in addressing the problem of pyrite damage and the more recent manifestations of mica-related damage in some western counties.  Since 2014, approximately &euro;166 million has been provided for the pyrite remediation scheme for certain eastern counties and County Limerick.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Sean Fleming:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In recognition of the stressful situation facing homeowners affected by pyrite and mica in certain counties, section 18 of the Bill provides for a similar temporary exemption from LPT for homes in those counties that have been damaged due to the use of defective concrete blocks in their construction and are eligible for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. <\/p><p>Section 20 of the Bill provides that property valuations will be reviewed every four years, rather than the current three years.  This provides a balance between the timely capture of changes in the property market and the need to limit compliance and administrative costs. <\/p><p>Section 21 provides that all new residential properties built between valuation dates will be retrospectively valued, as if they had existed on the previous valuation date.  Revenue will provide assistance to property owners to determine the value.  This will maximise the LPT base and ensure equity. <\/p><p>Section 38 implements the 2019 review group recommendation that the income thresholds for LPT deferrals be increased to &euro;18,000 from &euro;15,000 for a single owner and to &euro;30,000 from &euro;25,000 for a couple. <\/p><p>Section 37 provides for a reduction in the rate of interest on deferred LPT from 4% to 3%.  The Bill contains a number of other measures intended to improve the administration of the tax.  These amendments are in the nature of minor and technical adjustments. <\/p><p>In conclusion, I thank Senators for their attention.  I look forward to hearing their contributions on the Bill, which I commend to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#F01000","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":33,"content":"<p>As we had a good discussion about this at the finance committee last week, I will be brief.  First, it must be acknowledged that this review has probably been long overdue, since 2013.  I say that in relation to the revaluations.  The longer we leave revaluations to be carried out, the harder it becomes to bring in the change.  The other significant thing is that this Bill brings into the tax net more than 80,000 properties on which property tax has not been paid since 2013.  Anybody who has served on a local authority and who has tried to balance the books on an annual basis will know that had that money been available, it might have allowed councils to defer the property tax increases of up to 15% that they have experienced.<\/p> <p>We also had a good debate with the Minister.  While the Minister is only collecting it, one of the huge issues around property tax is how it is distributed afterwards.  We know the 20% equalisation fund will be phased out over the period.  However, the whole argument is on the baseline figure of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and on the self-funding element the Department uses an ongoing basis.  The local property tax was introduced to restore local democracy, to make councillors responsible for their decisions and to have them in charge of their spending.  When they lose the top 20% - and probably another 30% or 40% - based on baselines and the self-funding element, realistically we are not restoring that democracy.  There is an opportunity there because there is a commitment from the Government that the top 20% will not be in existence any more after this year.  <\/p> <p>The Minister of State can come back on this but is this a change to the definition of a residential property?  A number of people have been on to me about the definition of an acre, as well as about which structures on that acre are valued and which are not.  Much of it comes down to whether it is of benefit to the residential dweller.  Is it of benefit to their enjoyment in respect of that residential development?  The specific question I was asked was in relation to Covid-19.  We have seen many instances of people building offices or converting sheds outside into offices.  Is that considered to be adding to the residential enjoyment or is it not?  Could the Minister of State tease out some of the details of the exact definition during the process?  <\/p> <p>I will probably come in again later on during the amendments.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#G00300","speaker":"1640"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  It was acknowledged during the financial crisis that the broadening of the tax base was important.  At the time, it was one of the recommendations of the International Money Fund, IMF.  The household charge and the LPT brought in a system of guaranteed income from households across the country.  There were anomalies that became evident as time went on, including the fact that newer properties were not brought into the net post 2013.  It was unfair on those that were paying that others were left out.<\/p> <p>On the postponement of reviews, there was a concern as property values rose that people would end up paying more.  The postponement of reviews and of leaving things the same meant that was not an issue up until this.  The proposals will allow for changes to the methodology on the bands and the rates, which also is welcome.  Any tax should be fair, equitable and kept under review.  Anomalies should be closed.  The impact of the tax should be assessed.  Exemptions should be considered again where issues of fairness arise.  I welcome that all moneys collected locally will be retained within the county.  That is important, particularly for high-population and wealthier counties.  However, the impact of equalisation also needs to be considered and the State must provide the funding needed for counties with lower populations.  Such counties still have a large number of services that need to be provided and if they generate a lower level of LPT, that creates a shortfall within that local authority.  That also has to be kept under review. <\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that there will be more discretion for councillors to change the LPT rate.  However, I always wondered why Ministers stand up here or in the D&aacute;il Chamber in the month of October to present a budget.  Local authorities get their allocations from the Department at the end of November and local authorities set their next-year budget in early December.  However, it is at this time of year, months in advance of all that, when councillors must decide whether they will increase or reduce the LPT.  I always found that strange and not best practice.  I understand that this is to allow Revenue to set and generate the bills.  However, there should be a process whereby councillors can make their decisions at the same time as the Budget Statement.  They would then know what allocation they would get, not what they think they are going to get.  Decisions would not be based on looking at what they got for the past few years, setting out what they expect they will get and then, based on that, deciding what is the budget.  This will come up again in September and councillors will have to make those decisions.  It is difficult and there should be a different system in place.<\/p> <p>Local authority funding has been problematic in certain counties and, one could argue, in all counties.  There is no county that is separate.  I had meetings with officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as far back as 2016 about anomalies in Galway County Council funding.  At that stage I was told that while they understood and accepted there were issues in Galway, nothing could be done until such time as the LPT review happened.  First, that review will bring in the new houses that have not been billed before this.  In addition, it will allow for whatever other changes will take place.  On that basis, I am glad that the review is taking place.  It will allow for additional funding to come to the local authority by collecting revenues from those who were not previously billed.  However, it still raises the question of funding for local authorities.  The LPT is not to be the full funding for local authorities except in those larger, richer and more well-off local authorities.  The rates base is an area that needs to be modernised, as well as rates on businesses being charged on a per square foot basis and so on.  There is a whole question in relation to funding for local authorities that needs to be looked at.  <\/p> <p>I welcome the changes proposed in this Bill.  They are overdue and make it fairer and more equitable.  We often hear certain people ask what do people get from their LPT and of course, the LPT balances the books of the local authority.  The local authority provides an array of services.  Not everybody will have a footpath or a street light outside his or her house but local authorities have an array of services.  These include keeping the potholes filled, the hedges trimmed back and drainage works done, as well as community wardens and all else that is funded through the local authorities.  It is important that they have a sustainable base from both LPT and rates and of course for central government to be able to come in to make up that shortfall.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> There needs to be a fair and equitable model for the funding of local authorities, which we do not have at the moment.  Officials admitted to me that they do not know how the model was arrived at nearly 30 years go or whenever it was.  There have been many changes since then, including the establishment of Irish Water and other initiatives.  There are many different parameters that determine how and why Galway County Council, for example, gets a certain allocation from a Department.  The officials I spoke to cannot fully explain how that allocation is arrived at, other than that they will give a proportionate allocation based on the previous year's allocation.  It is difficult to say how the model was devised in the first place and whether it may have been wrong from the start.  It is very hard to justify why Galway County Council, Meath County Council or any other local authority would get less than it might need to run its services.  Galway, for instance, is way down the pecking order in comparison with counties of a similar size like Mayo, Kerry, Tipperary and Donegal.  It is way down the scale in terms of the number of staff working in the local authority and the funding per head of population.  We have an array of issues, including coastal protection and offshore islands, that add to the requirements for funding, but they are not entirely accounted for in the allocation we receive.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill as a first step towards correcting the issues local authorities are facing.  The larger issue of funding, including the model, type and level of funding, will not be sorted by these provisions, but they are a positive step in the right direction.  There will be additional funding arising out of the legislation for local authorities and the Exchequer and, most importantly, it will allow for additional and improved services and, in some cases, the continuation of basic services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#G00500","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>As I may not see the Leas-Chathaoirleach later, I would like to wish him well and thank him for all his work this year.  It is nice to see the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, in the Chamber.  He is very welcome, as always.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to the local property tax and our reasons are clear.  The tax, as designed, is not only a tax on assets but a tax on debts, such that many people who are liable for it may have debts worth as much as 90% of the value of the property against which they are being charged.  This concern should not be readily dismissed as it is a real and immediate concern for many citizens.  We need to consider the burden the tax places on households.  On 6 July, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage was told by witnesses from Revenue that, on average, 43,000 people defer payment of the LPT every year due to inability to pay.  In 2019, 50,000 homeowners deferred payment, more than 48,000 of them because they were below the income threshold.  Sinn F&eacute;in unapologetically flags its concern for the workers and families who see an interest bill accumulating for tax on their home, many of whom are saddled with mortgage debt or may even find themselves in arrears or negative equity.  We believe the LPT is badly designed and unfit for purpose.  Instead of a property tax on people's homes and, thereby, their debts, we favour the introduction of a wealth tax levied against assets.  The issue we have with the LPT is that it does not take account of someone's ability to pay.<\/p> <p>It is clear that this legislation is ill-conceived and ill-prepared.  It contains serious flaws.  The LPT is and has always been intimately connected with local authority funding.  Local government relies on central government transfers and own-source revenues, such as commercial rates.  Given the regional inequality that exists, which was deepened by the financial crash and barely recovering before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, fiscal equalisation has been crucial for the delivery of local services.  Fiscal equalisation is essential to protect financially weaker local authorities and their communities, and to correct the effects of regional inequality and the unequal distribution of sources of finance.  Before the introduction of the LPT, equalisation was achieved through general purpose grants, which were determined on the basis of historic baseline supports.  The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe, in a 2013 report on local democracy in Ireland, stated: \"[The] system of distribution of grants to local governments from the Local Government Fund is not transparent and the rules have been set without consultation with local authorities\".  Little has changed with the introduction of the LPT.  In this regard, I agree with Dr. Gerard Turley and Dr. Stephen McNena of NUI, Galway, that the current regime is not fit for purpose.<\/p> <p>This legislation will coincide with local authorities retaining 100% of LPT receipts, thereby ending the redistribution of 20% of the tax revenue through the equalisation fund.  This is an opportunity to redesign the equalisation model to ensure it is fit for purpose.  In 2021, 20 local authorities received equalisation payments totalling &euro;133 million.  It is essential that the current equalisation fund and how it is distributed does not simply remain the same, with funding coming from the central Exchequer rather than LPT contributions.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State has brought forward a Bill that contains serious flaws.  The changes brought about by this legislation will result in 36% of homeowners seeing their bills increase, while workers and families who are unable to pay will continue to see their interest bill rise on payments they must defer as a matter of necessity.  As I said, Sinn F&eacute;in is opposed to the LPT.  It is a tax that is badly designed and has failed to deliver quality local services for local communities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#H00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, a Sheanad&oacute;ir, as ucht an dea-ghu&iacute; agus mar an gc&eacute;anna duit f&eacute;in don samhradh.

That need has been driven home in the past year as we saw the very wealthiest become much wealthier during the pandemic.  We have seen an increase in the wealth of many of the people on the rich lists at the same time as a large part of the population has been experiencing incredible financial stress.  I am in favour of wealth taxes.  We need to look to the wide array of assets, including stocks and shares, when seeking to mark people's contributions.  I also support the local property tax.  Its introduction was very poorly done and it is still a work in progress, but it is important to acknowledge that those who own a property, albeit with debt attached, are in a different situation compared with the vulnerability of those who have only income and nothing to sell or even walk away from.  They include some of the most vulnerable families in Ireland.  Lone-parent families, in particular, have the highest rates of poverty and deprivation and half the level of home ownership of other kinds of households in this State.<\/p> <p>It is appropriate, therefore, that we have a property tax.  I have a number of concerns, however, in regard to how it is being applied.  Although I will address some of those concerns through amendments, the nature of a Finance Bill is that most of the proposals I might have put forward would potentially involve a cost to somebody.  It might not be a cost to the State - in fact, some of the proposals might even have had a benefit to the State - but there certainly would be a cost to somebody and the amendments would, therefore, be ruled out of order.  As a result, I am availing of the Second Stage debate to highlight some of my concerns.<\/p> <p>It sends a poor signal when we have the T&aacute;naiste talking in the past couple of months about how the people in Donnybrook whose houses have gone up by &euro;100,000 and those in Ranelagh whose homes have increased in value from &euro;535,000 to &euro;647,000 are going to see a reduction in their property tax.  It is a concern that this kind of message is coming from the Government.  It seems to be the case that someone whose property value has gone up to &euro;1.6 million will be paying a little less under the new bands.  That may be reassuring for a very particular audience at a very particular time but it sends a really poor message in terms of progressive taxation, which is still supposed to be the policy of the State.  Those messages were unfortunate and short-sighted if we want people to understand the importance of the LPT.<\/p> <p>Any revisions of the tax should be progressive and should reflect the principles of progressivity.  Will the Minister of State give us more information on the 11% of homeowners whose tax liabilities will go down?  He referred to the mid-point rate.  I do not know the extent of the revision but I know the bands are changing.  In fact, three things are being changed, that is, the mid-point rate, the bands and the rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->What we want, therefore, are examples of how are we really protecting the progressive nature of this.  Who are the 11% who are gaining out of this and how many of them are stacked towards the top of the scale?  I am also concerned that the scale kind of peters out at &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million.  What about properties worth &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million?<\/p><p>I have another concern, and some amendments to ask the Minister of State to look at it.  There is a big difference between those who own a property, which may be their home or their family home, or even those who own two properties because we have a mechanism in the form a second home tax, and those who own 1,000 properties or 500 or 100 or 60 or 50.  If we want to use property tax as a meaningful tool and if we also want to address some of the concerns the Minister of State will be hearing from the public, I suggest that we perhaps look at a different higher rate for those who own many properties.  I will not read all the tiers I have set out as we will come to them in the amendments but consider those who own 100 houses or 100 dwellings or two apartment buildings or those who own 1,000 rental properties.  Property tax may need to be changed and shifted on that.  That might be something the Government is considering or something that can done through the current system, but it is something that would be useful.  It would be really useful to have nuance and maybe more flexibility for local authorities, not simply to turn on or off the property tax or the amount involved but to be able to address these different situations.  We talk about recognising specific circumstances and exemptions at the bottom, and there will be concern that some of the exemptions at the bottom are going to be phased out.  Much as we recognise particular circumstances at the bottom with respect to vulnerabilities, we should similarly be recognising particular circumstances at the top with respect to people who have a particular ability to pay and a different capacity to pay.<\/p><p>When we engaged on this issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the finance committee I asked him about the vacant property tax.  Surely this is a tool we could use to address situations where there might be vacant properties.  We were told there are very different situations where people might have vacant properties.  This could be as a result of a bereavement but there may also be somebody who has 1,000 or 500 or 50 such properties.  There are, as we know, apartment buildings in which half the units are left empty so we need to be moving on a vacant property tax and recognising that.  When the Minister was before the finance committee, he told us that this is the gathering of information phase, that the vacant property tax will be coming later and that he would look at that based on the information.  However, I am concerned that this Bill, as drafted, will tie the hands of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of how that information will be used.<\/p><p>In section 31, which introduces a new section 39A, we have the information-gathering mechanism, which will include the asking of question as to is a property being used, is it empty and why is it empty.  Then there is a clause which says that this information will not be used for anything other than the compiling of statistical information in respect of residential properties which are not in use.  Thus, almost in advance, the Government is ruling out purposes it should be ruling in.  The Government should be stating that it wants the information in question, that it is not attaching a tax to it at the moment but that it may do so in the future.  Instead, the Government is stating that it can only be used for statistical purposes and that the data will not be available to Revenue if we decide next year to bring in a vacant property tax.  It would be a very small change.  I have amendments relating to it and I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting the principle, just to make it clear.  We should not end up with a situation whereby if the Government does decide to bring in a vacant property tax we get another year's delay because the Department must do a full survey of everybody again in order to have the same information again for the purposes of a vacant property tax, when the exercise has already been done.  That process being done twice would not be good value for money for the State.<\/p><p>On the question of fiscal equalisation, it is really important that this is not seen as the main source of revenue for local government because the position in the various areas across the country is very different.  I am concerned in that regard.  There should be progressivity in our funding and a move towards equality in how we fund our communities and regions in order that we ensure we do not simply reward those who are already wealthier.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#H00400","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat a Sheanad&oacute;ir agus samhradh sona deas duit f&eacute;in freisin.

I do not envy the Department of Finance, which has been given the task of arranging this system of valuations for new rates.  We are eight years on from the original valuation in 2013 and the Minister is correct in moving to regularise the revaluation of properties to a four-year cycle.  The timing of this tax was and is very difficult for many people.  However, the Government is trying to be fair to all citizens.  It has brought in all new property owners who have not been in the loop since 2013 and a large number of estates classified as unfinished whose residents have not been paying the tax.  They are being brought into the net.  The Government has made significant attempts to ensure that the vast majority of people will not pay more tax as a result of this Bill.  That is an important point to note.  Only a small number of people will see their property tax increase, although I know this will not go down well with certain individuals.<\/p> <p>I have some concerns about the equalisation fund.  At present, more than 17,000 properties are registered for the local property tax in my county, Longford, and 79% of them are on the lowest bands of 1 and 2.  Under the proposed new bands, more than one third of people in County Longford will get lower bills.  While this is welcome news, the consequence is that there will be a shortfall of revenue for the local authorities of somewhere between &euro;800,000 and &euro;1.5 million.  We will not know until Revenue comes up with the exact figures later this year.  Consequently, we must ensure we match the shortfall some counties, including my own, will experience.  Commitments have been given by the Minister for Finance on this to the effect that no county is going to suffer any reduction but I would like the Minister of State to put on record that this will be the case.  The Government Deputy in my county has gone on the local media, putting it out there that there is going to be a shortfall in funding because of the legislation we are bringing in.  Thus, that needs to be put on the record and clarified.  There should not be scaremongering about how we are going to have a shortfall of more than &euro;1 million in property tax revenue.  That must be made clear.<\/p> <p>When the tax was first introduced, we were told it was intended to improve services and infrastructure in each county.  I firmly believe it has done so, particularly in my county.  We must communicate to people what this funding is for and what services it actually funds in the counties because people do not realise it.  I contradict the comments by the Sinn F&eacute;in representative.  If one looks at the figures for the tax on houses in Northern Ireland, where Sinn F&eacute;in is in government, they are significant at &pound;1,500 to &pound;1,600.  We are looking at putting in minimal charges here to look after our Civil Defence, library services and fire brigade services and provide public lighting in our towns and villages.  That is just a small amount of what it does so we need to communicate properly to people that that is what it covers.<\/p> <p>In my county, we have worked on this in a cross-party way with Fianna F&aacute;il and Independents.  Councils are allowed to increase the tax by 15%.  A number of years ago, ours was the first local authority in the country that came to an agreement to increase it by 15%.  What we have done with that 15% is pay back a loan for matched funding for infrastructural projects in our county.  There was cross-party agreement that every district in the county would benefit from it and they have.  We have match-funded our CL&Aacute;R, our outdoor recreation infrastructure, our town and village renewal scheme, urban regeneration and development fund, URDF and rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF.  In the past three years, we have received three major RRDF and URDF projects of &euro;10 million for Longford, &euro;6 million for Ballymahon and &euro;3 million for Granard.  That is what we have done with that money.  We have used it to match funds and cover a loan for the costs we have.  When we went to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to put forward our case, we had this money in place.  We have been supported by the Government in that, which is a positive.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Over the last two years, probably 14 to 15 more local authorities have followed suit in what we have done because they have spoken to our head of finance.

There is no denying that it is a blunt instrument and is flawed.  It is not what any one of us would like to put in place but it is part of what I always understood to be a move towards self-financing of local authorities.  As somebody who spent 11 years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I have always welcomed the idea that local authorities would be self-sufficient and autonomous to the greatest extent possible.  In fact, my experience, as both a Member of this House and as a member of a local authority, is that central government seems do things in exactly the opposite direction.  It continues to take powers and discretion away from local government and from members of local government, from the people who are on the ground listening to the citizens in a way that officials either at central government level or at local authority level will never do.  Something I would often have said in the council is that the chief executive of the council never knocks on a door and asks people what they think about an issue.  They do not have time to do that and it is not their role.  It is the role of the councillors and they are doing that every day of every week and of every month of the year.  They know what people think.<\/p><p>I have always favoured the notion that they would have the real discretion to make changes and decisions at local level.  The reality is that since the Planning and Development Act 2000, we have continuously stripped away powers from councillors and have continuously removed their discretion to make decisions in the interests of the people they represent.  That is why I have always supported the idea of LPT.  It makes sense to pay locally for local services but I also accept the criticisms of the system in terms of how flawed and blunt it is.  That is why I also appreciate what is in this Bill because in some respects it updates the system.  There are missed opportunities in other respects but the rebalancing is very important in that there are people who bought houses almost a decade ago who have not paid local property tax while their neighbours who have older houses have.  There is a fundamental unfairness in that and it is very welcome that this Bill fixes that and creates a level playing field that should have been there.  I understand, particularly in the aftermath of the financial instabilities ten years ago, why it took time to do that but it is welcome and it is about time it was done.<\/p><p>I note comments from my colleagues, Senator Carrigy and others, that when this was announced there was much concern among people that they would see an increase in their property tax.  I spoke to a neighbour in Deansgrange recently who is on a fixed income, is a pensioner and is particularly worried about an increase she may experience.  It is important to remind people that the vast majority of people will not experience an increase and that the 30% of households will see themselves move only one band.  Hopefully, this will not represent a very significant change in what they have to deal with.<\/p><p>The real missed opportunities in this Bill are in respect of the discretion of councillors.  They are restricted in how much they can vary the local property tax.  I come from a local authority in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown where we pay the highest rates of local property tax in the country.  We are not, by any stretch, the wealthiest local authority although that is a common misconception.  The reality is that we have a low commercial rates base so the property tax that is collected in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown - it is also, incidentally, not the largest collection of property tax which I believe is Dublin Council - in the per-household-charge is higher than in any other local authority in the country.  We collect about &euro;50 million.  In the past &euro;10 million of that was immediately lodged in the equalisation fund, which I am pleased to see is also being rectified in this Bill.  In a local authority like ours, it was always appropriate that we would adjust the rate being paid in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown downwards by the 15% that is allowed under the legislation.  It is still not appropriate to restrict that percentage.  In 2012 when the original legislation came through, the idea always was that local authorities like D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown would have an opportunity to vary their tax downwards to reflect the fact they pay very high rates and that local authorities, like Longford, Carlow and others where the rates they paid were lower per household, would be entitled to increase their local property tax to reflect what they needed to take from it but also to reflect the individual burdens on households.<\/p><p>When I was a councillor on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and during the entire time Fine Gael has been voting on local property tax in this council, we have voted to decrease it for that reason, which is to reduce the very significant burden per household in this area.  Last year, despite the votes of Fine Gael councillors to decrease it, it was <i>de facto<\/i>increased by 17.7% which is a regressive move.<\/p><p>The missed opportunity in this Bill is that we could vest in councillors the trust to make the right decision for their area and about how much to vary it, upwards or downwards, and to take away that 15% restrictive margin that is there.  That is one of the missed opportunities.  Unfortunately, I do not have more time to discuss others.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill, however, and it is about time that we put a level playing field in place and that we put a little bit of equality back between households.  On that basis, I support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#K00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":44,"content":"<p>I am pleased to see the senior Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has arrived.

I will make some observations on what has been said and on some of the points that have been raised.<\/p> <p>This has been a very useful, important and interesting debate.  Many of the issues raised here are probably matters which relate to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage such as use of funds and equalisation.  Our role is to collect the tax and many of the policy issues that have been discussed here in respect of local authorities would be for the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, in that Department, which Members will understand.  Having said that, these issues impinge directly on the debate around local property tax and I will comment on them as much as I can.<\/p> <p>Senator Casey mentioned the question of the equalisation fund.  Members are coming to that issue from very different and diametrically opposed perspectives, which is fine and which is what a national Chamber should be about, and it is important to recognise that.  There are changes, however, in that the funds collected will now remain locally.  The obvious question then being raised today is whether there will be a shortfall for the local authorities which were the beneficiaries of the equalisation fund.  There was a commitment in the programme for Government to deal with this.  This was a commitment to strengthen transparency and accountability which may result in additional costs to the Exchequer in the absence of other changes.  There is a commitment there then that there will be cost to the Exchequer if other changes are not introduced in respect of the equalisation fund.  The intention here is not to penalise any local authority which will lose out as a result of this change.  <\/p> <p>The acre was mentioned.  In many pieces of legislation things get legs during the course of a debate and the main issue here was to transfer this measurement to one we all know as all land measurements are now per hectare.  All that is being required in this legislation, by and large, is to transfer this measurement to hectare.  People felt that that change was needed and it is still equivalent to the old acre.  I do not know if that is an Irish or English acre but whatever was understood to be an acre continues to be the case and is now being defined as 0.404686 ha.<\/p> <p>Another question raised was about properties that had 4 or 5 acres or more than 1 acre attached to them.  Logic tells one that the piece that forms part of the valuation is the land immediately around or abutting the house, including the driveway to the house.  If someone has 3 acres out the back for grazing a pony this should not be substituted for the valuable property and the driveway.  This is common sense and it is right to have this issue tidied up.  In case there is any doubt on this point, 99% of people know that the land immediately abutting the house was the relevant portion.  This just clarifies that one cannot substitute that more valuable piece of land, including the driveway in and out of the house, with the valuation for 3 or 4 acres that one might have adjoining the property which would have a much lower value in order to bring down the property value.

He mentioned the timing of allocations to local authorities.  Again, that is primarily a housing and a local authority debate.  We understand the issue of timing, but most local authorities and chief executives are in consultation with the Department and can prepare their estimates in reasonable time on an understanding of what might come.  They might have to be changed afterwards, but some local authorities get their estimates done very quickly, well before Christmas, while others take much longer.  I would say to Senator Kyne to ask the local authorities that get their estimates through.  The Senator said the valuation date for the local property tax is earlier than the estimates meeting.  That has to be the case because the valuation date is 1 November and Revenue has to be in a position immediately after that to issue the new amounts people should pay by single payment or through the payroll system, which some people have to do, and an extra lead-in time is needed for that.<\/p><p>Senator Gavan opposes the tax, and his views on that are well known.  He mentioned the equalisation fund and the deferral.  This is good legislation.  We are reducing the interest rate on deferred payments from 4% to 3%.  That is significant.  We are making the process better and more helpful.  There are arrangements in place to defer a portion of the tax, not all of it, depending on income limits.  We are increasing the income limits by which up to now if one was above a certain income one could not defer, so we are making improvements in that area.  I know the Senator will be pleased to hear that, even though he opposes everything we are doing today.<\/p><p>Senator Higgins mentioned a number of issues, mainly vacant houses.  That will come up on Committee Stage.  We are collecting the information for statistical purposes only, and that is what is in the legislation.  The Senator wants to know why the houses are empty, which is much more information.  I suggest honestly that if we were to do what she suggests - and I think she will take this in good spirits - I believe she would be one of the first to say we were breaching data protection guidelines on information relating to individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#K00300","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":46,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#L00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>Perhaps she would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#L00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":48,"content":"<p>It would be done on a legislative basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#L00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":49,"content":"<p>The Senator can come back to that on Committee Stage.

He said one third of people will pay less and the majority of people will not see an increase at all.  He mentioned the question of how the allocation of the local property tax is spent.  Again, that is a matter for local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  He raised the very interesting point that in Longford it was decided to use the extra money from the local property tax to help co-fund other projects on a county-by-county basis.  Some people hand the money over and let the executive come forward with proposals as to how it is to be spent.  I know another local authority where the entire increase in the local property fund through the annual adjustment is given over to the local councillors' discretionary fund in order that the local councillor, if he or she wants flashing lights for speed limits or footpaths in a town or village, has the authority to use that fund for that purpose.  There are a great variety of ways in which this extra amount of funding can be utilised at local level.  That is the essence of local government.<\/p> <p>Senator Ward said this is a blunt instrument.  He comes from an area that has the highest house values.  Generally, the Government tends to fund about one third of all local government activities each year from the central fund.  Approximately one third comes from commercial rates and approximately one third comes from other resources or funds such as parking charges plus central government capital funding for major projects the Government is funding, so there are quite a variety of streams.<\/p> <p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.

Section 18 of the Bill purports to provide an exemption for those homeowners whose houses have been affected by mica or pyrite, but does it?  It inserts into the Bill a new section 10D which states that residential property damaged as a result of the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction will be exempt from local property tax but only if it meets certain conditions.  Those conditions are, as set out in section 18, if the property has been or is being remediated or, under subsection 10D(1)(a), if &quot;a confirmation of eligibility in relation to the property has been issued&quot;.  What does &quot;confirmation of eligibility&quot; mean?<\/p><p>Under subsection 10D(6), confirmation of eligibility has the meaning given to it by the regulations that gave effect to the current and flawed redress scheme, whereby the applicant can have eligibility confirmed only once he or she has made an application to the local authority that includes the engineer's report confirming damage caused by mica or pyrite.  To spell that out to the Minister, Senators and those whose homes have been damaged by mica or pyrite, under this legislation homeowners will be required to have an engineer's report, which costs in excess of &euro;6,000, in order to qualify for this exemption to the local property tax.  To put it another way, if homeowners whose houses are crumbling around them as a result of the mica scandal are unable to fork out &euro;6,000 from their own pockets for an engineer's report, they will be charged local property tax by the Minister on homes that are not safe, homes that have lost their value, homes that are or will not be liveable in unless a 100% redress scheme is delivered.  Can the Minister not see that this exemption is unworkable?  Can he not see that requiring an engineer's report to qualify for an LPT exemption, when the engineer's report costs several times the annual LPT charge, simply does not make sense?  Can the Minister not see that this Bill, as it is written, will charge these homeowners local property tax as a result of his Government's flawed and broken redress scheme?<\/p><p>Our amendments are sensible.  They are what is necessary to ensure that homeowners affected by mica are not charged local property tax.  I urge the Minister to accept these amendments in the interests of these homeowners.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, will allow homeowners whose houses have been damaged or destroyed by mica or pyrite to apply for an exemption from local property tax on a self-assessed basis, with Revenue able to take a look-back exercise to assess eligibility for exemption once a new 100% redress scheme is in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#L01600","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>Listening to Senator Gavan, I am obviously sympathetic to anybody who is suffering from defective building materials and many people around the country are in dire situations.

One could not have a situation where a householder was allowed to form a view that his or her property had been damaged as a result of defective concrete blocks.

I thank Senators for the amendments that have been tabled and for the facilitating and scrutiny of this legislation.  I will begin my comments on this amendment by absolutely identifying and appreciating the anxiety, huge stress and damage that has been caused to families and homeowners, which in turn has been created by the damage that has been done to their homes by the material that was used to build them.  It has caused such harm to so many.  The Government at the moment is reviewing our response to this huge challenge for many people.<\/p> <p>The reason I am not in a position to accept the amendment is because of the way we have structured this exemption.  To access this exemption, a person needs to be part of the scheme that is in place now to recognise this issue for homes that are currently affected by it.  Access to that scheme is through a regulation that has been put in place by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That regulation and access to this exemption is in turn based on a similar exception we had in place for pyrite.<\/p> <p>At present, all of this is being reviewed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It could well make a decision that it will change recognition of damage through changing the regulation that is in place.  That is where that should happen, rather than through the local property tax legislation.  That work is currently under way.  I understand it will be concluded by the end of this month.  It really is not appropriate that I try to indicate in a local property tax Bill what we think are the right criteria for local authorities or the State deeming that a house has been affected by mica.  That is a policy issue on which further progress probably needs to be and may well be made.  With respect to Senator Gavan, however, I would contend to him that this work should not happen in the local property tax Bill.  It should happen through the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage through the regulation.  I believe that will be looked at in the context of the working group that is in place on this issue.  That is the only reason I am not accepting the Senator's amendment.  The place for these issues to be resolved is not in the LPT legislation.  If we did, it would prejudge the working group that is under way and then put in place access criteria that are not consistent with how pyrite is currently being dealt with.  For those reasons, while I absolutely appreciate the intention of the Senator with regard to this issue, I am still not in a position to accept this particular amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#M00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":64,"content":"<p>We will agree to disagree at this point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#M00400","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 2:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(d) For the purposes of an application under paragraph (a), the Revenue Commissioners may specify the form of an application and may require that the following information is provided to them: <blockquote> \t(i) the address of the residential property;<br \/><br \/>(ii) the nature and extent of the damage caused by the use of defective concrete blocks in the construction of the property;<br \/><br \/>(iii) any other particulars the Revenue Commissioners may reasonably require for the purpose of considering the application.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#M00600","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":67,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:  \t&ldquo;(5A) Notwithstanding subsection (1), a residential property shall not, for the purposes of section 16(1), be regarded as a relevant residential property, where paragraph (d) of subsection (1) applies, in relation to ten consecutive liability dates commencing where the first liability date falls on or after 1 November 2021.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#M00800","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":70,"content":"<p>Section 18 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Sections 19 to 23, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":72,"content":"<p>SECTION 24<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":73,"content":"<p>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 24 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":74,"content":"<p>I will briefly note I did not actually get an answer - I might not get it now and that is fine - in respect of those people whose property tax has decreased and the statements that were made.

However, I am concerned that, for example, as I mentioned, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and others told us that those with properties of &euro;1.6 million will potentially be paying less.  I am concerned about that 11% decrease for those who have the decreased rate.  How many of them are in those higher bands?  That was a question I asked but on which I did not get an answer during the Second Stage debate.  I obviously cannot table any amendments to it because they would be out of order automatically.

However, progressivity does not mean that those who are paying a certain rate now should necessarily stay at that rate or pay more.  I am not saying that is what Senator Higgins was saying.  There has been an unfortunate latching on to the notion that people who may have very valuable properties might see a decrease in their local property taxes.  However, if that is the effect of the bands, it is entirely appropriate.  I think this would happen only in a fairly minute proportion of the cases.  If they do experience a decrease in local property tax, it means they have been paying too much over recent years relative to their neighbours.  The key purpose of the Bill is to provide equalisation - a fair and level playing pitch.  Some people who have been paying no local property taxes since their houses were built in 2013, or whatever year it was, will now be brought into the net.  That creates a greater total fund coming from LPT, which allows most people to experience either no change or a reduction, which is the important part.<\/p> <p>I reiterate what I said on Second Stage on the flexibility of this.  There is a missed opportunity which unfortunately we cannot amend because it is not mentioned in the Bill and given that we are in the Seanad, we are restricted on the extent to which we can do that.  One of the missed opportunities in bringing in local property tax reform legislation is not trusting in local authorities and not allowing councillors to make a real decision about the rates householders in their areas should be paying.  The 15% buffer either side of the full rate represents a missed opportunity for us to say we trust local authorities to decide what rate their householders should be paying.  Why not allow them to vary it by as much as they believe is appropriate - perhaps even by 100% one way or the other?  The councillors on the ground understand what is reasonable.  There is a lack of trust of councillors to make that decision when in fact that is the direction we should be going in.

I will take a step back to look at what we are doing with local property tax.  The evidence from other countries that have had property tax regimes in place for much longer than we have is that the difficult moment for those regimes happen at two points in time.  The first one is when the local property tax is implemented for the first time and the second one is when the first revaluation happens.  In many countries it is done on the basis of self-assessment.  If a local property tax regime can cross the hurdle of being implemented comprehensively and get the support of all taxpayers, it then needs to cross the next hurdle of the first revaluation taking place.  They are the most significant moments in the cycle of the local property tax regime.<\/p> <p>I hope that when this revaluation occurs, we will get beyond that and we can look at the role of the tax in three years' time when we are having this debate again.  At that point the issue Senator Ward raised regarding the application of the LAF could be considered.  The reason I did not do it now is that while we have done extensive modelling on what this new structure will mean from a revenue point of view, in truth we need to see what will happen once we implement it.  After the revaluation has occurred, we will have a far better idea of the stability of revenue.<\/p> <p>Because of my concern about maintaining the yield and increasing it a bit by introducing new taxes, I felt now was not the right time to broaden the discretion and breadth of the LAF variation in the way the Senator suggested.  However, once the first revaluation has occurred, the discretion that local authorities have and the choices they make should be definitely considered.  The Senator has raised an important principle.  However, because the first revaluation is so important, we need to get that done first.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins spoke about the progressivity of the tax.  If the value of someone's home has increased in line with the national average of approximately 75% since 2013, there is every possibility that their local property tax bill will be unchanged or it will change a little bit in either direction.  If the value of someone's home has increased by less than 75% in recent years, he or she may get an LPT bill decrease.  People whose homes have increased in value by more than 75% are likely to face an increased LPT bill.  We have looked to manage the affordability of the increase for some by widening the bands and cutting the rates.  For the minority of the homes, the value of which has increased by more than 75%, we are doing what we can to ensure their increased bill will be affordable.  <\/p> <p>Those principles apply to homes of all values.  For homes that are at different values - the more expensive homes or homes that would have a lower valuation - those principles still apply.  That is a consequence of having so many homes, the valuation of which have all changed in different ways.<\/p> <p>Senator Higgins spoke about the reality of progressivity and the need for progressivity to be perceived.  That is why we have introduced an extra rate of 0.3% for homes above a certain value of &euro;1.75 million.  It is in an effort to maintain progressivity and the reality of progressivity.  However, that progressivity does not peter out at that point.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The way the liability is calculated, then, is for that part of the value which exceeds &euro;1.75 million.  The tax is applied for that portion of the value of a home which goes above &euro;1.75 million.  My contention is that we are seeking to maintain the principle of progressivity, but I also note that it will apply to all homes, regardless of value.<\/p><p>Turning to the point made by Senator Ward regarding additional discretion for local authorities, I believe we will return to that point.  It will be valuable though for us to get this first revaluation done.  It will no doubt bring up all kinds of challenges when we undertake it, and it will begin in November.  We will then be at a point where the base of homes taxed as part of the local property tax increases every year.  We do not have that mechanism now and it creates real issues of equity.  It is important that we make progress in that respect and this is the thinking behind this section of the Bill.

The Minister told us then that was almost the information gathering stage and perhaps the introduction of such a measure would come later.  In the text of this Bill, though, I am concerned about the constraints placed on that information gathering process.  It is framed in a way which will make it very difficult for this information gathering process to translate into action concerning a tax on vacant properties.<\/p><p>The Minister made a strong case for his perspective, but I believe we should be bringing in such a tax, with certain caveats and exemptions, on vacant properties now.  However, even accepting the Minister&rsquo;s argument that we should have an information gathering stage and assessment in this respect first, I am concerned by the framing of the provision dealing with whether a house is in use as a dwelling.  Subsection 2 of the proposed new section 39A of the principal Act states that information &quot;shall not be used for any purpose other than the compiling of statistical information in relation to residential properties in the State which are not in use...&quot;.<\/p><p>Effectively, therefore, a caveat is being introduced stating that the information collected will not be usefully available in respect of the potential introduction of a vacant property tax perhaps until we have another revaluation in three years' time.  We have a crisis in housing now.  We have been told that every tool must be used and that they are all necessary, including all kinds of things about which I have many concerns, such as the use of public lands.  Vacant properties, however, are also a concern.  If it does emerge that there are many such properties in Ireland, then we cannot afford to and nor should we wait for three years until the next revaluation to ask owners if their properties may be vacant in respect of a levy.  The Minister talked about the difficulty of introducing these systems.  It would also be an unnecessary and laborious process to have to introduce a brand new system at some stage between now and the revaluation in three years to again ask everyone in this State who owns property whether those properties are vacant.<\/p><p>The opportunity to gather that information for the purpose of the introduction of a vacant property tax exists in this revaluation process, albeit the Minister is not using it for that purpose now and it is not in this legislation.  Mention was made previously of difficulties with the general data protection regulation, GDPR, in this regard.  There is nothing in the GDPR which states this cannot be done, but the situation is being created where the information gathered for the purposes of a vacant property tax could now be constrained under that regulation.  However, people are already being asked to share a great a deal of information on foot of this legislation which could be used for revenue purposes.  GDPR is very clear.  Things are done based on consent or legislation.  We have legislation being proposed here and there is absolutely no reason why we cannot undertake my proposed measure within it.<\/p><p>I suggest the removal, therefore, of what is an unnecessary caveat.  If it is to be inserted though, a clear other purpose should be included as well.  The main point in this regard is that information must be given for clear purposes.  I have suggested in my amendment No. 5 that such a clear purpose could be defined as &ldquo;such use by the Revenue Commissioners as may be required in respect of a levy or tax&rdquo;.  If we wanted to be more specific, then we could describe the clear purpose as meaning &ldquo;such use by the Revenue Commissioners as may be required in respect of a levy or tax on vacant residential properties or a certain category of vacant residential properties&rdquo;, as set out in my amendment No. 6.  Those are clear purposes and there is absolutely nothing stopping the Minister putting such purposes in the Bill to enable the information collected under the auspices of this legislation to be shared for the purposes of the collection of the local property tax as it stands and for such related purposes by the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p>It would be really useful to do so and we are already asking people to include many different types of information in their local property tax returns.  We may discover from those returns that there is a pattern of large-scale property vacancy and that many such properties have been vacant for long periods of time, for example.  This is one aspect of market logic, but that may be a discussion to have another day with a different Minister.  Of course, situations exist where artificial scarcity drives up prices and has value.  We have seen it being done, and being done in apartment buildings right here in Dublin.  It is not a nefarious plan, but market logic.  It is how the market works.  If there is such a pattern of large-scale property vacancy, as we have heard there is, then this is the chance to get the information to enable us to act in that regard.<\/p><p>My later amendment, which I am not sure we will get to, is concerned with instituting special measures for those property owners with perhaps 100 or 1,000 properties and it suggests they should pay a little more.  A new calculation mechanism may be needed for the local property tax in those circumstances.  However, even including a signal regarding the potential intention to introduce a tax on vacant properties under this legislation could itself have a positive impact.  It would encourage people to consider not retaining a pile of vacant properties and to ensure such properties are being used as homes.  A positive signal could be sent through this legislation regarding the potential introduction of a vacant property tax and that could have a positive impact on the market.  I am worried that subsection (2) of the proposed new section 39A sends the opposite message, however, that we are not going to do anything about this situation for three years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#O00600","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Following on from Senator Higgins's point, many of our towns and villages have vacant properties.

She said she was in favour of such a vacant homes tax, with certain caveats, and that is a very understandable and legitimate position to take.  My expectation is that once we get into a debate on what those caveats are, it will pose a question regarding the utility of the tax in the first place.  If more exemptions are put in place, it is possible that the number of properties that are affected by such a tax could begin to decrease quite quickly.  The truth of it is that none of us knows yet what that trade-off is because we do not have the kind of valid and hard data needed to answer those questions.  For example, if such a tax is introduced, should it be implemented differently in areas that are rent pressure zones as opposed to areas that are not?  When we begin a debate on exemptions, if we get to such a point, should we provide an exemption for a home that is empty for family reasons?  If so, how many of those homes are there?  If we are going to provide such an exemption, for how long should such a home be empty in the context of the trade-off if that home was used in another way to provide a new home to a different person?  These are all trade-offs we will need to discuss.<\/p><p>I predict that if we get to a point where I make a proposal in regard to such a tax, the call for such a tax to be implemented will be quickly followed by many legitimate cases that are made for exemptions from that tax.  It is in an effort to get ready for such a potential point that I believe there is real value in, once and for all, getting a dataset in place so we can have that debate.<\/p><p>I entirely agree with the point made by Senator Higgins that if we are looking at the implementation of such a tax, the mere signalling effect of such a debate beginning can, of itself, have a value.  I think we will begin to see such signals develop when we get to a point where taxpayers paying the local property tax electronically can go onto the portal and tick a box to indicate that a home is vacant and, if so, why.<\/p><p>In regard to the Senator's point on how long it will take for that tax to be implemented and the role this data could play, first, if we generate enough data that indicates there is a solid basis for such a tax to be introduced, I will not be waiting for the next revaluation date.  If and when information becomes available to me that shows there is genuinely a group of homes that we believe are empty for longer than the Oireachtas feels to be worthwhile, and we want to tax that, my intention would be to not wait until the further revaluation happens.  The reason for that is, of course, the great challenges we face in providing enough homes for those we represent and serve.<\/p><p>In regard to the limitations that are in place with regard to data collection under this Bill, these limitations were put in place after we consulted with the Data Protection Commissioner.  It is the view of the Data Protection Commissioner that such limitations are required, and we need to be consistent with regard to the advice that we receive.<\/p><p>On the amendments put forward by Senator Higgins, amendment No. 4 would remove any limitation as to what that data could be used for and I do not believe that would be appropriate.  As interested as I am in seeing what this data would be, there should be limitations in place regarding what that data could be used for in the future.  If Senator Higgins believes there are too many limitations in place, I would say to her that having no limitations at all is equally problematic.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 extend this limitation for the purposes of a future levy or future tax.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are, therefore, inconsistent with amendment No. 4, given that amendment No. 4 refers to no limitations and amendments Nos. 5 and 6 state that there should be limitations in regard to how this data could be used.  Moreover, I ask the Senator to consider how appropriate it is to collect personal data for use in regard to a tax that does not yet exist.  There are important issues that mean it is not appropriate at this point to accept the amendments.<\/p><p>In regard to this data and information, and its role in the actual execution of the tax, if I recommend to Government and the Oireachtas that we go ahead with this, and if we go ahead with a vacant homes tax, that would be in the context of the local property tax regime.  The local property tax regime is based on the principle of self-valuation, so we then have to ask homeowners to form a view themselves in regard to whether their home meets the criteria of vacancy that could be set out in a future potential tax.  Therefore, in any event, even if I accepted Senator Higgins's amendments and believed that, in particular, amendments Nos. 5 and 6 should be accepted, and if the Government and the Oireachtas decide to deal with the issue of vacancy through the local property tax regime, that local property tax regime is fundamentally based on the principle of self-valuation.  We would then be asking homeowners to say to us whether their home is meeting the criteria of a new area of the local property tax structure.  This would mean we would have to question the value and utility of the data we have collected up to that point, beyond what I am looking to use it for, which is to answer the question of whether this tax is needed and, if it is needed, what would be the number of homes it could affect the use of.<\/p><p>It is for those reasons that I am not in a position to accept Senator Higgins's amendments.  Nonetheless, her contribution raises very valuable issues that we will be coming back to, which are the trade-off between the breadth of a tax base and the exemptions to that base and, if more and more exemptions are put in place, what is the impact on that tax.  However, in order to cross that bridge, the first bridge we have to get to is understanding how many homes could be affected by such a regime, and that is what we are looking to do here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#O00800","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":90,"content":"<p>In regard to the fact of there being variations in amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, that is the nature of the situation when we have legislation going through all Stages.  The presenting of options has to happen side-by-side on Committee Stage rather than Members being allowed to have a discussion and a different version on Report Stage.  However, amendment No. 6 is completely legitimate and, while it is obviously not going to pass today, I urge the Minister to discuss it with the Data Protection Commissioner.  I believe it has a clear purpose and we collect things for particular clear purposes.  Once it is clear what that purpose is, that purpose does not have to be current and it can be future, but it must be a clear purpose.  The amendment  sets out a clear purpose in respect of the levy or tax on vacant residential properties, or a certain category of vacant residential properties.  That is quite a clear purpose and would be a legitimate and appropriate use because there is that concern with regard to gathering the information and how the information is used.  It seems a whole process of self-evaluation is about to be undergone in the autumn, a review is scheduled for three years' time and it seems there would then be an entirely separate process of self-evaluation related to the vacant property tax.  I worry that the requirement for such a measure could delay what may turn out to be a very important measure.<\/p> <p>In regard to those different categories and exemptions, I do not think it is going to be as big or as complicated as the Minister thinks.

Gathering the information and simply attaching it to each property is different and it is probably not what we need in terms of identifying the patterns.  For the same reason, we also need to look to where there are multiple properties owned by somebody, which may be legitimate in the case of one, but the same argument cannot stand in 50 different instances.  Does the Minister know what I mean?  The concern is not just about an individual vacant property, it is about groups or suites of vacant properties.  In compiling the statistical information and preparing this issue, which will need to move forward in the autumn, the Minister will get more support across the House than he might conceive.  There will be exemptions, but I do not think they will delay us very much.

The amendment refers to the statistical information that we have discussed on vacant properties but there will be statistical information of other kinds, including the information that would be created by my amendments Nos. 10 and 11, and I seek that it would be shared with both Houses of the Oireachtas and that there would be a report looking at the data on the ownership of residential properties - of course, not looking at personal data in any respect but looking to that statistical data so that we can address and have the discussions we need to have on the information and on the patterns which have emerged.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 specifically set out a request that there would be compiling of statistical information and identification of trends on the patterns of quantities of residential property ownership in respect of both this Act and the principal Act and that policy options or recommendations might be set out regarding the potential introduction of differential rates of local property tax on residential properties where such properties are owned by persons who: &quot;own two or less residential properties&quot;; &quot;more than two but less than twenty&quot;; &quot;more than twenty but less than fifty&quot;; &quot;more than fifty but less than one hundred&quot;; &quot;more than one hundred but less than one thousand&quot; and; &quot;more than one thousand residential properties&quot;.<\/p><p>This is the crux.  If we simply look at each property and we do not look at the patterns of ownership but then we have those exemptions which people rightly pushed for, that recognise the real and social circumstances of individuals who are the owners of those residential properties, it is appropriate that we look at that when we are considering matters such as exemptions.  For example, when we looked to first-time buyers in the past we considered whether exemptions might be needed for them.  Similarly, we should be looking to the multiple property owners, to those who own entire blocks of buildings and sometimes almost neighbourhoods of residential properties, the large real estate investment trusts that in many cases own portfolios of residential properties or half an entire housing estate.  They are different, as the first-time buyer was different on the other end, and are at the top end of the scale.  It is appropriate that when we are looking at vacant properties, rather than saying we are just going to look at the property, that we compile statistical information that looks at the patterns of ownership and what additional contribution could be made by somebody where, although perhaps it is a family home, the property owner owns multiple properties and it is part of an investment suite.  It would be reasonable that we might look to an additional treatment and change in the calculation algorithm to have a measure that would reflect situations whereby somebody owns multiple properties.  I included a tier of &quot;more than one thousand&quot; because there are those who own more than 1,000 properties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are those certainly in that space between having 100 and 1,000 properties.  I was going to go from 100 to 500 but I thought about how long I could make this list of differentials.  What I have tried to capture here is the difference between the person with a home and the person with a second home.  The latter is a separate category and we have dealt with it in the past.   There are also the small landlords who might own a building or a place with five apartments.  They are captured here.  The larger investors with between 50 and 100 properties are commercial property investors at that point.  Then there are the huge international investment funds that own hundreds or thousands of properties here, Vancouver and elsewhere in the world.  It is reasonable we ask them to pay a little bit more towards the property tax.  This is why I am asking the Minister to look at the policy options.  He can compile information.  As he has indicated, I know he likes to gather information first.  We can gather this information and the Minister can share it with us in the Oireachtas so we can engage with him on it and consider it.  I would like it sooner than the next three-year review but I set the date of October 2022 so it would be there in time for the next three-year review.  We can consider the potential introduction of additional tiers or structures in our property tax for multiple homeowners.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#Q01700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":109,"content":"<p>There are three points on this.  It is worthwhile considering the dimension of this debate, which is that individuals or companies may own large groups of homes and properties but this is because they have built them.  If they did not own them these properties would not be built.  If supply is part of how we respond to the great challenges we have in housing, it poses the issue that we may find the reason companies, funds or individuals own a larger group of properties is exactly because they built them with a view to owning them.<\/p> <p>On the interesting and important point the Senator makes regarding understanding better the patterns of ownership in our society, the data already exist.  They are published by the Revenue Commissioners in the statistics section of their website.  Much of the information the Senator is looking for is publicly available.  At present, there are 177,000 property owners who own two or more properties.  The statistics available to us are based on the categories of two properties, three to five properties, six to ten properties, 11 to 20 properties, 21 to 50 properties , 51 to 100 properties, 101 to 200 properties and 201 properties and above.  The published figures indicate that in 2020, 100 persons owned between 101 and 200 properties and no owner had more than 200 properties.  Local authorities and approved housing bodies are excluded from this.<\/p> <p>The Senator in her contribution said there are investment funds that own hundreds of thousands of properties in Ireland.  There are not.  There is an ongoing debate regarding the role of investment funds and the contribution they make to the ownership and the supply of properties but it is not based on the fact that they own hundreds of thousands of properties in Ireland.

The Bill makes provision to open indoor hospitality under certain conditions and makes minor amendments to the system of mandatory hotel quarantine.  The Bill will give effect to the Government&rsquo;s decision to enable access to relevant indoor premises for fully vaccinated persons and persons who are immune from Covid-19 by virtue of the fact that they have recovered from the disease.<\/p> <p>On 28 June 2021, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, advised that indoor activities expected to reopen on 5 July \"which, by their nature are high risk activities involving significant levels of social mixing in indoor environments, should only be permitted for those who have been fully protected by vaccination or who have had Covid-19 infection in the previous nine months\".  NPHET advised that easing of these measures should only proceed when supported by a robust, non-reproducible and enforceable system of verification of vaccination or immunity status. <\/p> <p>The Delta variant is much more transmissible than anything we have seen so far in this pandemic.  Yesterday, almost 1,000 new cases were reported.  Today's figure is likely to be significantly higher than that and these figures will continue to grow.  We are seeing particularly high infection rates in those aged 16 to 24, as well as rapid growth in the number of infections among those aged 24 to 29.  The most up-to-date modelling includes the changes recommended by the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which allowed us to accelerate the vaccine programme for younger age groups.  The second-best scenario presented by NPHET now shows over 200 people in ICU in just a few months&rsquo; time.  That would mean the curtailment of a lot of planned healthcare for people in Ireland, which is something we have to avoid.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Two things we have in our favour are the vaccine programme, which is going from strength to strength, and our ability to respond to this variant by following the public health advice and keeping each other safe.  Right now, for people who are not yet fully vaccinated, it is as important as any time since the start of this pandemic to continue to follow the public health advice.  If they become symptomatic, they should self-isolate immediately and get tested and they should please avoid higher risk activities like indoor socialising and international travel.<\/p><p>During the debate in the D&aacute;il on this Bill, there were calls from some quarters to open up hospitality fully.  We have seen from some other countries just how quickly that can further accelerate the increase in cases and hospitalisations.  Others have been calling for opening up just with a test, even an antigen test.  Again, given the rapidly increasing prevalence of the disease, particularly among those not yet fully vaccinated, I hope these calls will be dropped and that the proposed approach, which is a safe one, will be supported.  Every week that we can maintain these higher levels of protection helps.  Every week, several hundred thousand vaccine doses are being administered.  Today, the online portal opens for those aged 25 to 29, which is ahead of schedule.  By the end of this week, all second doses of AstraZeneca will have been administered.  Three in every five adults are now fully vaccinated and this weekend we will administer the 5 millionth dose of vaccine.<\/p><p>On the Bill, section 1 sets out the Short Title, commencement and operational provisions, which are time limited.  Section 2 is a standard definitions section.<\/p><p>Section 3 inserts new sections, 31AB to 31AL, into the Health Act 1947.  Section 31AB provides that it shall be lawful for an indoor operator that is otherwise not permitted to open to grant access to a relevant indoor premises under the following conditions: that reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that only permitted persons are admitted; that operators do not knowingly allow access to persons who are not permitted persons; that personal data should not be retained; and that the operator must adhere to guidelines set by certain bodies prescribed by the Minister.  The section provides that the Minister may make regulations across specific areas, which will allow adjustment, if necessary, to the arrangements in light of experience and in response to evolving circumstances.  Section 31AC provides that an operator may request evidence that a person is permitted.  Providing a forged or fraudulent document is an offence with a fine of up to &euro;2,500.  Sections 31AD to 31AK relate to compliance, inspection, cessation orders and appeals.  Powers include the power to seek emergency closure orders.  Section 31AL provides that data shall only be processed to verify proof of immunity and will be retained for no longer than required.  Section 4 provides for various definitions.<\/p><p>Section 5 amends section 38B of the Health Act 1947 and introduces a provision for a public health doctor to assess that a person who is in quarantine because he or she has been in a designated state and has received a positive Covid test no longer poses a threat of infection.  It provides for a change in definition of the pre-travel testing requirement for a PCR test to a test as defined in regulations.  This allows for any changes in pre-testing requirements to be incorporated automatically.  It also inserts section 38B(3A) into that Act, which would allow travellers obliged to quarantine as a result of arriving from a non-designated state without a valid pre-travel test to undergo post-arrival testing rather than being automatically obliged to enter quarantine.<\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 38G of the Act of 1947.  Section 38G(dd) will permit the Minister to make regulations, as public health advice allows, for tests other than PCR tests for the purposes of hotel quarantine.  It will allow the Minister to regulate on the administration of new tests and any fees payable by applicable travellers.  Section 38G(de) will permit the Minister, having regard to the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, to regulate for a testing pathway alternative to mandatory hotel quarantine for travellers who arrive without a valid pre-travel test or are otherwise exempt from the requirement to undergo mandatory hotel quarantine.<\/p><p>Section 7 amends section 38K of the 1947 Act with consequential amendments from drafting changes and corrects a drafting error in the Health (Amendment) (No. 1) Act 2021, section 38G(1)(a).<\/p><p>With this Bill, we have an opportunity to get tens of thousands of men and women back to work, and to do so safely.  Some people advocate moving faster, opening fully or opening with testing, but that would not be safe right now.  Others advocate keeping the sector closed.  How would that be fair to the men and women all over Ireland who have suffered for so long and who want to get back to work, when we have been advised that they can be brought back to work safely?  Nothing about this pandemic is easy and nothing about it is fair.  What we have to do each time is find a way forward that works and that is what this Bill seeks to do.  It will get tens of thousands of men and women, many of whom have been out of work for a year and a half, back to work safely and in a way that does not put their safety or that of their customers at risk.  This is the way forward that will achieve that.

I commend him and his team in the Department of Health, as well as the HSE staff who have been working so hard during this pandemic.  The Minister hit the nail on the head when he said that this Bill is about getting people back to work and doing so safely.  People have been unemployed for months on end and it is heartbreaking to see people who have built their businesses up not being able to get back to what they love doing.<\/p> <p>I accept the advice of the Chief Medical Officer that indoor dining is a high-risk activity and is not safe for people who are unvaccinated.  I have friends who have had Covid and they have told me exactly how they suffered.  These are young, fit and healthy people and they are still suffering.  They still find it difficult to get back to activities like jogging or even to run upstairs in their house or run after their kids.  It is not a nice thing to have and we have to ensure we stay as safe as possible.  We do not want to flood the hospitals.  We want our children to go back to school at the end of August and this is what we need to do in order for that to happen.<\/p> <p>I was very disappointed with some people who claim to represent workers and the interests of people working in low-paid industries because what has been suggested by some quarters is not safe for workers.  It would put workers and young people at risk.  We have seen a spike in cases among those aged 16 to 24 and we have evidence from other European countries that were ahead of us and did open indoor dining.  They are now regretting that decision.  We have been acting cautiously but in the best interests of the Irish public.  Many people support these measures.  I have spoken to many people in my area and around the country and they understand why this is happening.  People are eager to take up the vaccine.  Some 60% of the adult population are fully vaccinated and 75% are partially vaccinated.  I am one of those partially vaccinated people and I look forward to getting my second vaccine dose.  I certainly would not expect to be admitted to an activity like dining indoors unless I was fully vaccinated.<\/p> <p>Some of the rhetoric around this Bill has been populist and reckless.  That language is very dangerous and insulting.  I hope we do not have a repeat in this House of some of the ridiculous language we heard in the D&aacute;il the other night.  I hope we can act responsibly and maturely and stop whipping up anger, upset and terror among the population.  People are stressed out enough at the moment without feeling that there is some kind of ulterior motive here.  I would ask the people using language about apartheid to talk to somebody who actually lived through apartheid in South Africa and tell me if they would compare not being able to go indoors without being fully vaccinated to what they suffered through.  This is also nothing like the discriminatory laws in the American deep south and to compare it is deeply insulting.

It has been an odd feeling seeing people celebrate receiving their Covid passes online.  It is dystopic to see people so glad to be granted this piecemeal freedom by the Government as if these fundamental rights were its to give and take as it sees fit.  However, I do not blame people for grasping at any sliver of hope that might allow them finally escape the miasma of fear that has descended on this country, called down by incessant panic-inducing media coverage, a dearth of effective communication by this Government and a slapstick succession of backtracks, fumbled plans and fudged decisions.<\/p><p>That all Stages of this legislation will be passed in 90 minutes on the last day of the sitting of this House is a disgrace.  That the Government has put its backbenchers in the position of sticking a smile on and voting in favour of this, not to mention its waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny, is an insult to its own party members, many of whom share serious concerns about this targeted dividing of society.  The Deputy Leader of this House said online only last month:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI believe the government have made the wrong decision to proceed with a plan to allow only fully vaccinated people back to indoor hospitality.  We are splitting the people &amp;amp; leaving younger people behind, the very cohort that have shouldered the greatest burden to protect others. <\/blockquote> <p>However, the whip has been cracked and the line must be toed.  It is a sorry way to do business.<\/p><p>It is not as if the reopening of society took us by surprise.  It has been talked about for more than 18 months yet, time and time again, aspirational roadmaps were found to be worth less than the paper they were written on.  Members of the Government could not conjure up anything more insightful or effective than sitting on their hands and adopting a wait-and-see approach, kicking dates down the line as vaccines were trundled out.  At least NPHET, for all its faults, had the decency to model multiple scenarios, none of which the Government thought merited a contingency plan.  Instead, we have a plan that was hashed out over two weeks in consultation with the hospitality industry, which was given no other option.  I support the full reopening of hospitality for everyone, which the Bill does not complete.<\/p><p>Were all this the case regarding harmless legislation, it would still be indefensible.  The reality is that I have never seen the floor of this House sullied by a Bill so repugnant to human rights and civil liberties.  That it would be the policy of this Government to draw a line down this country and ever so graciously bestow on one cohort its erstwhile suspended rights, while continuing to limit the freedom of others, demonstrates the blatant lightness of regard towards the gravity of such an act.  There has been much performative outrage recently over the drawing of certain historical comparisons on the authoritarian nature of this legislation.  However, you do not need to look beyond the history of these shores to see the legacy of a divided people and a Government that treats some of its subjects as lesser.  <\/p><p>While businesses will rejoice at this piecemeal legislation, the Government is selling them a pup which will prove damaging to their businesses, as it is completely unenforceable.  I support the call made by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n in the Lower House that this Bill be referred to the Supreme Court by the President in order for its constitutionality to be examined.  Failing this, I call on independent bodies, such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, to challenge this Bill, which sets a dangerous precedent for Government-sanctioned discrimination.  We went into this pandemic together and we should come of it together in an expression of solidarity that is entirely absent from this law.  For all these reasons and many more, which I have not been given time to discuss, I will oppose this Bill. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#W01100","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":153,"content":"<p>The Senator was asked to withdraw what was deemed offensive in her speech.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#W01200","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I reserve the right to have my speech on the record of the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#W01300","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":155,"content":"<p>I take it that the Senator is not withdrawing her comments and the inflammatory language she used.

Quoting history and using the type of language the Senator used is totally appalling.  I welcome the Minister to the House and I am sorry he had to put up with that tirade but such is life.<\/p> <p>None of us want this Bill; of course we do not.  We want to see a normal society where hospitality operates as normal but, unfortunately, we have had a pandemic, as a result of which more than 5,000 of our citizens have lost their lives.  Hundreds of thousands of people have got sick with Covid.  Thankfully, many of them have recovered but there are people who are suffering from long Covid and who have life-changing injuries and conditions as a result.  We have to tread cautiously.  We all want to see hospitality open but we want to protect as many people as we possibly can from contracting Covid.  We are in the midst of what will be a significant fourth wave involving the Delta variant.  What is being done in trying to allow hospitality to open in safe way while at the same time ensuring as many people as possible are protected is a fine line.  I have no doubt that this Bill will not get everything right but, to be fair, it is a very good stab at getting the hundreds of thousands of people in hospitality back to work.  <\/p> <p>I represent County Clare and, as the Minster knows, it is heavily reliant on the tourism industry.  In Clare, there are peak visitors for about two to three months of the year.  August is a particularly busy time as it usually when occupancy rates in our hotels are nearly 100%.  Restaurants, bars and various other hospitality venues are very busy during the months of July and August.  We have lost July at this stage.  People are making as much as they can out of outside dining.  Many people have spent a lot of money to facilitate outdoor hospitality but many venues and businesses are just not in a position to offer that.  <\/p> <p>We have a responsibility as a Government to facilitate the opening of those businesses and to do so in a safe way.  Facilitating people who are fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid with the digital certificate is probably the best we can do.  From talking to people I know that many will not avail of indoor hospitality because they are still nervous and concerned.  Even with businesses opening on 26 July, I suspect many citizens will not take up the opportunity for inside dining.  I have been in the Oireachtas for ten years and we have never been in a situation where, on the last day of term, we were bringing legislation through to facilitate the opening of restaurants, bars and so on but that is just life.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Two years ago, nobody had heard of Covid.<\/p><p>I believe we need a strategy for long Covid.

I cannot support this legislation.  This plan is unworkable.  I do not need to tell the House that young people put their lives on hold to protect older people and their families and friends.  They did that to reduce the risk of getting long Covid, as the previous speaker outlined.  Many of us have met or know people who have had to endure long Covid.  Young people sacrificed their personal freedoms.  They had to listen to whataboutery, as it were, on more than one occasion.  It got a bit like <i>The Valley of the Squinting Windows<\/i>at times.<\/p><p>This legislation is not based on public health advice or scientific advice and is hardly enforceable because it is incredibly light touch.  It will be done on a nod-and-wink basis.  Regarding the HSE, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, I wonder how it will be enforced.  The detail regarding compliance officers is quite sketchy.  The Department and Government have been unable so far to say how many compliance officers there will be or what exactly they will do.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on that in his response.  There has been no investment that I am aware of in the HSA or the HSE to do this work.  God knows, the HSE has enough to do.  Whatever about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na monitoring businesses that may have been open when they should not have been during the strictest level five lockdowns, it will not touch this with a bargepole.<\/p><p>I am also concerned about the lack of engagement with workers, unions and with the Six Counties.  There does not seem to have been co-operation with the North.  It has been covered here by the Minister.  Yesterday, Dr. Tony Holohan encouraged vaccinated people to be very careful when using hospitality venues and going indoors, but what about the young people who must work indoors?  What about the young people who are working in these establishments where there is food, where people will not be wearing masks and where there will be unvaccinated people aged under 18?  I cannot support the proposals that lock young people out because they have not received a vaccine but where, as unvaccinated workers, they will be asked to come in.It is not beyond us to come up with a plan that includes everyone and keeps a lid on the fourth wave.<\/p><p>While I will not be supporting the Bill, we are tabling some sensible amendments that I hope will be taken on board.

I welcome constructive criticism.  I welcome and will defend the right of people to offer constructive criticism but I would ask people to beware of populism.  Populism concocts enemies, misrepresents social problems for its own benefit and proposes slogans as solutions.  Its effect is to divide communities.  Like everywhere else in the world, in Ireland, we must be on our guard against populism.  Populism seeks out legitimate social problems - not to cure them but to use them to undermine the very fabric of the society.  In that way, populism is wholly destructive.  It sets out a them-and-us narrative and imagines conspiracy where there is none.  It alleges fraud and wickedness where none exists.  At times, populism can be full of raw negative emotion, and indeed it can be anti-intellectual and have an adverse impact on society, especially the vulnerable, so I urge people to temper their remarks in a constructive way.  This country must deal with the pandemic, but if nakedly challenged as an opportunistic breeding ground for populism, it must be countered with positive energy aimed at solutions.<\/p> <p>Despite the success of the vaccination programme, on which I commend the Minister, there is still a prevailing sense of insecurity or uncertainty affecting many of us at a subconscious level.  We are internalising worries about variants and new working dynamics, and even being physically close to people again is causing anxiety.  We took so many basic things for granted.  We are hoping that, some time soon, mentally challenging restrictions will be about to ease and fade into the distance.  We are clinging to this hope.  Hope is fostered in conversations where the potential for a sense of the restoration of normality is now being actively discussed.  We all want the spontaneity of life to return.  Any positive or cautiously optimistic conversation that infers or countenances a return to more normality will lift the heart of the nation and ease all our minds.  However, in truth, we are treading on thin ice.  In these unprecedented times, we must try to advance relaxations and get rid of restrictions in a safe way to make sure they work.<\/p> <p>We are social creatures.  Our hospitality sector is on its knees and we have lost some people in that sector due to the mental pressures caused by financial stresses.  I know this at first hand as a founder of New Beginning at the time of the previous crash.  We had the great and the good.  The big, the old and the bold came before me in my office and were reduced to tears because they could not earn a livelihood.  They were in bits.  They crumbled before me or the courts in a far colder environment.  Apart from the many livelihoods in the hospitality sector, I understand there are up to 180,000 jobs on the line, many of them in rural Ireland.  We cannot sit idly by and watch the hospitality sector collapse and blow an enormous hole in our economy.<\/p> <p>Another significant stakeholder we often might forget about is the customer - Mr. or Miss citizen of Ireland.  Tragically, we lost some of those customers whose reliance on that vital community interaction sustained them.  They clung on to that natural social interaction.  We are in new territory as we predict, test and measure.  That is how it has always been.  There is nothing definite about the future.  We have to take risks, and I emphasise, as the Government has emphasised, these include risks in compliance with public health standards.  These are calculated risks and measured risks.  When facing a period of unprecedented challenge, calculated risks can and should be taken or else we stay in the darkness unaware of the light that is not too far away if we only reach out.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

It is possible to strike a balance when it is a temporary or short-term balance.  It is a proportionate response.  Nobody has the ideal solutions but we must try to do our best.

I am certainly one of the people who is very worried about the current infection numbers, where they will go and the possibility that restrictions in some other form will need to be reimposed.  That is shared by many in the community.  Alongside that worry is the sense that for workers, young people, those living on their own and families, we must now start to learn to live with Covid-19.<\/p> <p>Looking at this Bill, there are three very clear reasons I and my party are very deeply concerned about the legislation.  We cannot stand by the discrimination that is such a key part of this Bill.  Not only are young people being excluded but it also affects people who for whatever reason cannot take the vaccination.  That might include pregnant women before the 14th week of pregnancy or those with other health conditions.<\/p> <p>On the design of the legislation, we all know that no legislation is worth the paper on which it is written unless it can be enforced.  It has been said by others and the Minister has heard it all week.  Do we really expect that caf&eacute;s, restaurants and bars will have the staff to police this system?  Any of us who have been to a caf&eacute;, bar or restaurant know we wait for a service and they are typically just about staffed for the current requirements, so expecting them to have additional staff to try to police this system does not seem realistic.  The question must be asked of why we are putting a system in place that is potentially designed to fail, which will lead to widespread non-compliance and an even worse position than we currently see with infection rates.<\/p> <p>This brings me to the heart of my biggest concern with this legislation.  The Government has failed on a number of counts to proactively implement provisions so we can start living with Covid-19.  We have known for many months now that the vaccine is clearly the most crucial plank of our response to the pandemic.  It is like driving a car where the vaccine is the engine but we will not get too far with just the engine and we need many other moving parts.  There is an absolute need to put the other complementary parts in place, including antigen testing.<\/p> <p>The Minister has heard plenty of Deputies and Senators talking about the need to get over the disgraceful dithering on antigen testing and put in place a system for it.  It is about making sure there is education about how to use an antigen test and what is or is not possible with the use of antigen testing, including what to expect with its level of sensitivity.  In England, even when a person is vaccinated, they are given an antigen test going out the door.  In Austria, every household has been allocated five antigen tests.  We have also seen what happens in Denmark, with the widespread use of antigen testing.<\/p> <p>What have we done about ventilation?  There have been comments today about people standing with workers and I hope the Government will accept our amendments on ventilation standards, which must be put in place.<\/p> <p>At the heart of this is the question of what we are doing to protect workers in this sector.  I have heard much rhetoric that these measures are in place to protect young workers but hotels have been open since 2 June and young workers have been in those hotels serving unvaccinated people like me and many others in this Chamber.  I know from speaking with others that many people have made a trip to a hotel.  We are told the reason we wear masks is not to protect ourselves but to protect others from us.  We must put in place all those other complimentary measures to the vaccine programme to ensure we can begin to live with Covid-19.<\/p> <p>The young workers in these sectors desperately want to go back to work.  This may be their full-time job or they may be students who must earn a crust in order to provide for the college year.  We know their pay level is the minimum rate or barely above it.  Their average earnings in this sector are 45% of earnings across the sector as a whole.  It is indicative of where these workers live and their capacity to be resilient against infection if they must isolate, for example.  We have a number of amendments and I hope the Government will support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#Y00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":163,"content":"<p>I will share my time with Senator Dolan.  There is no doubt we all went into this together but we did not all feel the effects in the same way.  We did not all experience this pandemic equally and there is no doubt that despite what have been unprecedented supports from the Government for the hospitality industry, that sector has suffered immeasurable financial and other losses.  Many of these businesses are family-owned and the people involved may have their whole lives mortgaged.  Is it reasonable for us to give them hope of opening, which we did just after Easter, only for them to be gutted when that could not happen on 5 July in the way we all had hoped?  These people are hurt and the Government must come forward with a solution that assists businesses in their opening while holding public health together.  Our people must be protected as much as possible from the Delta variant while we have increasing numbers of people being vaccinated.<\/p> <p>\"Populism concocts enemies\" is possibly the best phrase I have heard this week so I say \"well done\" to Senator Martin.  It is exactly what is going on here and I regret that it has been brought into this House.  It was also evident in the other Chamber.

We need to ensure we put measures in place to help people get back on their feet again.  We need to consider the resourcing for very small places to manage the monitoring of that and simplify it.  The Covid tracker app is a really good way of doing that.  What other ways can we consider to simplify the monitoring part of this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#Y00500","speaker":"1654","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":166,"content":"<p>The Minister is welcome, but I oppose the Bill.  The time has long passed since the Government could seek to get the benefit of the doubt over its Covid-19 measures.  Ministers have consistently shown such rank contempt for both Houses that any request for new powers ought to be flatly denied.  As usual it will be nodded through by Government Senators as was done by Government Deputies before us.<\/p><p>During the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill, I was struck by the sheer number of points and questions put by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies which the Minister directly and deliberately ignored.  I have had direct experience of this.  As he knows, on the floor of this House, I asked him detailed questions about the unconstitutional ban on public Mass.  That question was dodged on the promise of giving a written response.  It took two months to issue and when it arrived it was a cop-out answer.  That causes major concerns to me and others about parliamentary accountability these days.<\/p><p>There is a fundamental injustice underpinning this Bill.  The notion of intergenerational solidarity, so extensively promoted by the Government when it suits, has been abandoned.  A commitment made and restated by the T&aacute;naiste as recently as four weeks ago that there would be no discrimination between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated has been cynically abandoned.  All it took was a wave of the magic wand by NPHET for a set of apocalyptic projections to be accepted by the Cabinet virtually without question.<\/p><p>As the Minister ignored questions posed by Government backbenchers in the D&aacute;il, I do not have great confidence that I will get answers here, but I will ask them anyway.  Why are we seeking to divide younger people from older people who are vaccinated when the Government explicitly said at all times in the last 12 months that it would not do that?  What is the target date for the introduction of antigen and PCR testing as an alternative to the vaccination passport for entry to pubs and indoor dining?  Under this Bill private businesses would be privy to personal medical information.  How will this information be held?  Does it not put business owners in an appalling position regarding the legal obligations over retention, handling and destruction of information?<\/p><p>Throughout the summer of 2020, restaurants and pubs which serve food were open and thriving although there were restrictions on social distancing, contact tracing, advanced bookings and so on.  If the Minister had told anyone back then that 12 months later 4 million vaccine doses would have been administered with 55% of the population fully vaccinated but that those pubs and restaurants would be closed for indoor hospitality until 19 July and that people would have fewer freedoms for summer 2021 than they had in summer 2020, they would have called for the men and women in white coats - it is an equal opportunity profession.  However, the fact that we are here is an absolute indictment of the Irish political and policy-making system.<\/p><p>NPHET's worst-case scenario, dropped in its usual bombshell fashion a couple of weeks ago, was that without continuing restrictions 2,170 could die in Ireland by the end of September due to the Delta variant.  As recently as yesterday, it claimed that even with the restrictions in place, 1,800 could be dead in that time.  One of the problems we have had since last year is that NPHET's apocalyptic predictions have never been tested because it is in the glorious position of being able to predict anything at all in the full knowledge that the Government will implement whatever restrictions it seeks.  The fact that its worst-case scenario did not ultimately happen is then taken as evidence, <i>ipso facto<\/i>, that the restrictions sought were justified and had the desired effect.  The story of Chicken Little and the sky falling comes to mind.<\/p><p>For the first time, on this occasion, we will have a direct ability to gauge whether NPHET is correct because of the near total relaxation of restrictions planned for the United Kingdom next week.  If NPHET's doomsday predictions of the Delta variant are accurate, we should see bodies literally pile up in the UK over the next ten weeks.  If more than 2,000 would die in Ireland with no restrictions, going by NPHET's maths we should expect to see at least 32,000 deaths in the UK by the end of September with 900 dead in Northern Ireland.  Does anybody believe there is the slightest chance that will happen here?  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.  Either 32,000 more deaths will occur in the UK before the end of September or NPHET's modelling of the impact of the Delta variant is, at best, entirely wrong.<\/p><p>Some people would say it is an attempt to scare the public.  Will there be any accountability for NPHET and the Government if these projections are shown to be wildly inaccurate?  Will the media and the political system simply shrug shoulders in an outbreak of collective amnesia and move on to the next set of projections?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#Z00200","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":167,"content":"<p>May I offer the Senator a point of information?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#Z00300","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I regret I do not have time to accept it.<\/p> <p>Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste told the D&aacute;il there is a prospect that the 45% of the population who are not fully vaccinated could overwhelm hospitals this summer.

As someone involved in the industry, it is hard to take what I have heard today.  It is even harder to take what was said in the D&aacute;il Chamber on Wednesday night.  As the Minister and other speakers have said, Covid is not fair.  Nobody disputes that Covid discriminates and has a greater impact on certain sectors of society than on others.  We have all seen discrepancies throughout this process.<\/p> <p>At the start of the pandemic, we asked the elderly to stay at home and not to go out which was frightening for them at the time.  Young people have been affected most.  All I can say to them is that they will probably have a bit longer to recover from it then the rest of us.  That may be a positive.  They have certainly taken the brunt of this.  Even with the reopening of indoor hospitality, they are at the forefront of this because they are not vaccinated.  We have asked leaving cert students to go back before other students.  University students have not been able to attend college.  Throughout this, there have been discrepancies and inconsistencies but that is what we had to do to deal with the crisis.<\/p> <p>Regarding the reopening of my industry, accusations were made in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I was disappointed that one Senator claimed there was widespread and wholesale non-compliance with the regulation, which is hurtful and disappointing.  The industry is trying to reopen more than 13,000 premises with probably 150,000 employees who have not had the opportunity to work properly in more than 18 months.  There are complications in it and we will have to deal with certain issues.  However, when we opened indoor dining last year, we had our paper and pen.  We took the names and the numbers for everybody who came in, which shows that we can deal with this.  All I can ask is for the people themselves to make their own decision.  If they are not happy with the premises, nobody is forcing them to go in.  They can turn around and walk out the door.<\/p> <p>Before making my last point, I thank the Minister and everybody else who got us to where we are today.  I offer a special thanks to all the front-line workers and emergency workers who went out and served the country in the middle of the pandemic.  I thank them because we were also discriminating against them.  While we sat at home in safety, we put them at risk.  There is risk throughout all of this.<\/p> <p>I want to focus on what was said in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday night.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Pat Casey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am not too sure of the process that must be followed but I will ask the Cathaoirleach later what I can do about the misleading and false information that was given on the floor of the lower House on Wednesday night by Deputy Paul Murphy.  He stated: \"In November, the middle road was bowing to the pressure of the lobbyists to open hospitality in December and cause the deaths of more than 1,000 people in January and more than 1,000 people in February.\"  I have had a problem with this since last December.  Our hospitality sector was blamed for the outbreak in January but there is no evidence of that.  Where is Deputy Murphy's evidence the hospitality sector caused 1,000 deaths in January and 1,000 more in February?  We must call it out.  I am disappointed with our national radio stations.  Our own Taoiseach went on and tried to say it was not just hospitality but wider society which led to the death.  Everyone in here knows about the house parties that were going on at Christmastime and on New Year's Eve.  Hospitality only opened up for ten days leading into that period.  I, therefore, for ask the record of the House be corrected in that regard.  The Opposition is playing every side.  Opposition Members are playing every angle they can but they our playing with our industry and people's jobs and livelihoods.  I ask them to reflect on that when they make those outlandish statements about the hospitality sector.  We will do our best.  We have a safety charter in place.  The hotel industry has been open since 2 June and young people are working in that sector.  Dr. Tony Holohan has said the young people are a low risk in this sector.  Opposition Members should not be selective when they pick on Dr. Holohan and his remarks.

Unfortunately, the Government is faced with Hobson's choice.  Something must be done and the consequences of doing that mean certain people are going to be lose out.  To say I am very uncomfortable with the discrimination that has been mentioned is an understatement.  I do not like it.  I would have less of a problem, for example, if there were people who chose not to take a vaccine, but for people who have not yet had the chance yet to get a vaccine to be part of a group that does not get to experience something is unfortunate in the extreme and not something I want to suggest I am happy about for a moment.  At the same time, all Members will have received emails from restaurant owners, bar owners and small business owners throughout the country who are on their knees, need the support of the State and need to get back to business.  We have taken significant steps forward in that regard with the outdoor dining scheme, which has worked well.  However, we must also move forward in another area and we must put in place regulation that is going to facilitate the return to business, where possible, for those people.  The \"where possible\" bit is of course the part we probably do not all agree on.<\/p> <p>Earlier other Senators referred to how this was going to be policed.  That is a red herring.  I am much more concerned about the disadvantaging of or discrimination against certain groups.  I am less worried about the policing.  It does not suit business owners and I accept that but it is already the case, for example, that restaurants must police certain aspects if they are operating under a liquor licence.  That is in the same vein as this.  I am less concerned about the staffing of that policing because in the same way that when one arrives at a restaurant one is seated at one's table, that is the point at which the policing, mar dhea, takes place.  There is an opportunity for the person who is admitting the party to the restaurant to ascertain the status of that person in a relatively straightforward way and the systems there are tremendously important.<\/p> <p>On the whole, the legislation is not ideal.  We are not happy about it and I have heard others say how unhappy they are with it as well but it is a step forward and a necessary evil.  The Government is in an invidious position and it is doing its best.  This is the most workable solution to getting as many people as possible back to work and back into a functional economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#AA00400","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I echo the words of Senator Ward.  People say I have a vested interest here as I grew up in the hospitality industry and we have a gastropub at home.  It is run by my brother and sister-in-law so I have nothing to do with it but I understand the challenges they are facing.  I hear from my family members on a daily basis about staff and the different issues surrounding them but we must try to get the hospitality sector open in as safe a way as possible.  While many of us are not happy about the fact people are being discriminated against, we must still think about getting as many people out because we have heard so much about people's mental health and different issues that are affecting them.  I believe in doing it in the safest way possible.  While it was a difficult decision for the Government, the way in which the Minister is bringing in the legislation is probably the best.  Some people will not be able of avail of indoor dining but, as has been said, they have a choice and that is what it is about.  It is about allowing people to make that choice.  Nobody is forcing them to go inside the door of a premises.<\/p> <p>Today sees the portal opening for those aged between 25 and 29 to register for vaccination.  Many of our young people have availed of the vaccines available from the pharmacies for those aged 18 and above.  That is a successful programme that is being rolled out.  There are two issues.  Part 1 of the Bill it refers to PCR testing and Part 3 provides for the introduction of antigen testing.  Today, six of the education and training boards have launched antigen testing on a pilot scheme and that must be acknowledged.  I have two questions for the Minister.  What about those who are unable to avail of the vaccine due to different conditions such as pregnancy or allergy problems?  Are they going to be left out in the cold?  That is something I would like him to consider.  Will priority be given to people who are working in the industry with respect to their vaccination appointments?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#AA00500","speaker":"1384"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House again.  I want to ask a number of questions before talking more generally about the legislation.  This is about the broader area of the hospitality and entertainment sectors and plans for reopening more generally.  It is important to these groups that clarity is provided.  There were plans that theatres, arts venues and other similar indoor entertainment venues would be able to allow up to 100 patrons entry in the coming weeks.  I would be grateful for clarity on if or when that will be happening.  There is an issue around when amusement arcades will be able to open, which the Minister will be familiar with from his experience with Bray, as I am with Wexford.  I ask him to offer clarity on that.  We are still awaiting clarity on drama camps, particularly indoor ones.  The other significant concern is that the plan was always that from 5 August weddings could have up to 100 guests.  I ask for clarity from the Minister on whether that will still proceed.<\/p> <p>On the broader issue, this is not legislation that anybody wants to see being introduced.  Nobody here wants this legislation and the sooner we achieve practically full vaccination of our population, the sooner we will be in a situation where we do not need this legislation.  I keep hearing from those opposite that we need a plan.  The Government's plan has been very clear, namely, we open things as safely as is possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We started with schools, construction and other sectors of the economy and society.  The important thing is that those premises can open safely and resume business.  As Senator Casey stated eloquently, the last thing that businesses want is to reopen and have to shut down again.  That would be a disaster for them and nobody wants to see that.  The Netherlands opened its doors and is now having to reintroduce restrictions.  This Government has a plan and it has worked so far.<\/p><p>In response to what Senator Mullen said, I must point out that we have had 5,000 deaths in this country.  Each of those deaths represents an individual but the rate of mortality per 100,000 citizens is among the lowest in the world.  If we had adopted some of the approaches that are being suggested by the Opposition, the rates of mortality would be much higher.  Is that the approach that those opposite wanted us to follow?<\/p><p>No country has got everything right.  People will recall that everyone was calling for us to follow the examples of Australia and New Zealand.  Less than 10% of the population is fully vaccinated in those countries.  There are big issues around their vaccination programmes.  We do not hear those who are arguing for the Australia and New Zealand approach saying we should have followed their approach on vaccination.  Every country has made mistake and this Government has made mistakes too.  However, there has been a clear plan to which the Minister has stuck.  He has been willing to take constructive criticism and to engage on it.  We now have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.  The vaccination programme is going exceptionally well.  As Senator Maria Byrne remarked, hopefully we will be in a situation where all those people who are working in hospitality and wider society will be vaccinated in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>I am going to take on Senator Keogan, who has she suddenly started to express concern about young people.  I raised in this House the impact that Covid was having on young people last November.  Soon after that, the Senator was sneered at my concern about the lack of opportunity for young people to build relationships and so on.  During that debate, the Senator also questioned the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine.  The one thing I will say about the Senator is that she is consistent in her inconsistencies on this matter.<\/p><p>The Government has a plan.  We do not want to be introducing this legislation but it is to allow things to reopen safely.  I hope that everybody is vaccinated as soon as possible so we do not have to reply on this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#AA00600","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":179,"content":"<p>May I come in there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":180,"content":"<p>You may not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00300","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I was referenced there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":182,"content":"<p>There will be chances to come in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00500","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Will there be?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00600","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":184,"content":"<p>We are taking everyone in turn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00700","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Any discrimination is unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB00800","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I call Senator Carrigy.

It is temporary, for a period of up to three months, during exceptional circumstances and in the public interest.  That is what the Bill is about.  Am I 100% happy?  I am not, but what are the alternatives?  Opening against public health advice and strengthening the Delta variant, which did not exist when we set the reopening dates three months ago, would be more dangerous.  Leaving all the business closed until we achieve herd immunity for all citizens might take a number of months.  No one wants businesses to open and have to shut down again.<\/p> <p>I fully support the Bill because it is a temporary provision to allow indoor hospitality to reopen in a safe and sustainable way.  That is safer than the alternative route of fully reopening.  The Bill is about getting businesses open and people back to work.  There are in the region of 20,000 pubs and restaurants in the country and more than 250,000 people working in the hospitality industry.  The vast majority of those businesses have been closed for 12 months or more.  As tourism spokesman, I have met numerous groups representing this industry.  What I have taken from those meetings is that over 50%, in some cases up to 70%, of the income of those businesses is earned during the months of June to September.  We need to protect those businesses and give them an opportunity to maintain their livelihoods.  I trust them to operate professionally and efficiently when they reopen within the health guidelines.  I compliment Senator Casey, who spoke for the industry.  We need to listen to the people in the industry.  I am glad that when the decision not to reopen was taken, the Government sat down with the industry.  At a meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, I said we should meet with the industry before making those decisions and work together.  That has happened and that is why these proposals are on the table.<\/p> <p>We have a situation at the minute where people are travelling to Northern Ireland for holidays.  We want people to spend their time in this country to make sure we get businesses reopened, people back to work and ensure they can maintain their livelihoods.  It is regrettable that the Opposition parties are using this for political purposes.  They are playing with people's jobs and livelihoods.<\/p> <p>I will be fully supporting the Bill.  As numerous Senators have mentioned, I would ask that we look at the issue of PCR and antigen testing.  That issue must be looked at.  Many other countries across Europe are implementing that testing and we should consider it.<\/p> <p>This Bill is about reopening our hospitality industry, which has been closed for 15 months.

It has been absolutely extraordinary to listen to the lectures from people.  There has been an honesty to the debate from the Government side.  Not one of us, including the Minister, want to be here with this legislation.  None of us do.  However, there is a fundamental line at which many people, particularly Senator Keogan, have not looked.  On the first page of the Bill, the phrase \"having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health\" is used.  We, as legislators, are charged with the duty of passing legislation.  To be fair to Senator Warfield, there is merit to what he is suggesting regarding young people and antigen testing.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications has made the case for antigen testing for a long time.<\/p> <p>The fundamental point is that we are passing legislation to reopen indoor hospitality and dining.  There are conditions attached.  If you talk honestly to the people who work in the hospitality sector at every level, they want us to pass legislation to allow them to reopen.  That is what they want.  However, we must not fail to learn from what has happened around the world.  Senator Malcolm Byrne referred to what has happened in Australia and New Zealand.  There has been a surge in cases in 49 states in America.  I heard what Paul Reid said on \"Morning Ireland\" earlier.  I challenge everyone to go back and listen to what he said in the context of the number of young people who are being admitted to hospital.  Each of us knows people who have had Covid.  Unfortunately, we also know of people who died from Covid.  None of us ever wants to go back to the dark days of Covid at the beginning of last year and this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jerry Buttimer:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Will I share time with Senator Lombard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#BB01300","speaker":"1637","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I appreciate Senator Buttimer doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#CC00200","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":193,"content":"<p>I am happy to do that.

Few Bills like this one have come before the Oireachtas in our time here in the past ten years.  It is a difficult Bill to support because it is dividing society and excluding.  That is obvious and accepted by everybody.  It is not something anybody or any Government would do lightly.  In some parts, it is even going against NPHET's advice, which is not something we have done since before Christmas and we do not do that lightly.  I appreciate the dilemma the Government is facing between securing the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people who are going back to work in the next couple of weeks and an industry that supports Ireland and on which we rely so heavily.  I will be supporting this Bill but it is qualified support because we must all see, with a sense of urgency we have not seen to date, an implementation plan on the introduction of antigen test screening in hospitality, transport and all of the aspects of life we have not seen or people have not been able to access for the past 16 months.<\/p> <p>We need to see it in and around the same time as we expect our restaurants and pubs to open on 26 July.  I have to be honest, we have seen so much flapping around with regard to antigen tests for months.  We have had illogical resistance.  We have had insults to the Irish people's intelligence in that we could not possibly use them and all the while, the HSE was using antigen tests to make sure its own staff were returning to work safely.  We have enjoyed social cohesion in this country, in the main, over the course of this pandemic but we are really testing people's patience with this law.  If we do not provide the mechanism to allow the people who are being excluded by this law to partake in Irish society, we are at risk of losing that social cohesion and solidarity we have enjoyed for the past 16 months.<\/p> <p>Including the children of vaccinated adults in this law does allow families to make decisions for themselves and that is probably to be welcomed, but the inconsistency of the messaging between Government and our Chief Medical Officer, CMO, is absolutely jarring.  The Government is saying it is okay for kids to go for their burger and chips indoors with their mammies and daddies but we also have the Government and the CMO saying it is not advisable and \"I would not do it if I was you\".  At the same time, we are telling our kids they cannot have indoor summer camps which we all know they need for their mental health and well-being but in six weeks' time we will tell all parents it is safe for our children to go back to school.  Which is it?  There has to be consistency in our messaging and I am sorry to say that has not been employed for the past couple of months.<\/p> <p>This is emergency legislation which is why we are taking all Stages of it together.  It is emergency legislation to allow people to eat and drink inside.  The irony here is we still have women, up and down the length and breadth of this country, who are giving birth to their children on their own and, in some cases, losing their babies on their own.  That says an awful lot about our priorities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#CC00700","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Doherty for showing the leadership that only the Leader of the House could show to get us through this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#CC00800","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":199,"content":"<p>This is an extension of the plan we have been following, which is that we are about protecting lives and livelihoods.  We are in a race against time, in terms of dealing with Delta and getting people vaccinated but also making sure hospitality has a chance to survive over the summer.  It is about indoor hospitality.  When it comes to hotels, they will continue to follow social distancing to allow that mix of vaccinated and non-vaccinated people.  There is nothing in here specifically about weddings.  Is it implied that weddings will continue to operate in that way, in that they will have social distancing or will be handled the same way as hotels?  It is not clear.<\/p> <p>It is also not clearly acknowledged that weddings do not always happen in hotels.  They can happen in specific wedding venues and in marquees and people's back gardens.  We need to be really clear about this with people.  When we are talking about indoor premises, are couples and people attending weddings covered within that?  If they are attending a wedding in an indoor hospitality venue that is not a hotel, are they covered within that?  I ask again about August and clarity around the 100 people who may attend.  People who are getting married need to know that now and there is a role for antigen testing in the context of weddings.<\/p> <p>I am coming back to issues I have raised many times, but there is still a lack of clarity around northerners and people who got their vaccines in the North.  My colleague, Deputy Neale Richmond, raised the issue with the Taoiseach the other day and the Taoiseach said there is no issue on that.  There is no issue on what?  We really do need to know how it will work.  Will the digital Covid-19 certificate integrate with the Northern Ireland Covid-19 passport?  Does it align on the same destinations or does it depend on what airport one uses?  If people depart from Dublin and have the Northern Ireland Covid-19 passport, does that mean they are subject to the rules of Ireland, as a country?  If they go from Belfast, is that a third country?  There are loads of questions people are asking and, without clarity, people are flying blind.<\/p> <p>I would like an update around the WHO recognised vaccines for people versus the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  There is only one strategy here based on division and it is not the Government.  This is the staggered reopening based on the vaccination programme.  Part of the opposition will jump on any opportunity to create a them and us situation.  People that might jump on that bandwagon need to think very carefully about that, because I do not want to go down the road of a them and us society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#CC00900","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Can Senator Crowe make a Gettysburg-like speech?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#CC01000","speaker":"1692"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I will indeed.  I welcome the Minister to the House and thank Senators Doherty and Currie.  I want to support this Bill.  As all Members of the House have said, it is far from the preferred way of reopening indoor hospitality.  It is far from the ideal way of doing so.  I compliment the Government which is doing an exceptional job.  Vaccinations for another section of the youth, those aged 25 to 29, opened today which is very welcome.  We need to reopen without restrictions and something is needed until we can complete the vaccination programme.  This would appear to be the best compromise.  Having spent most of my life working in the hospitality sector, the summer period is absolutely crucial for all businesses.  The feedback I have gotten from businesses across Galway city and County Galway is that while it is not ideal, they would far prefer to open up indoors in this manner than remain closed any longer.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ollie Crowe:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The hospitality sector has been hit incredibly hard by the pandemic despite unprecedented Government supports.

I ask the Government to act swiftly to try to reopen society in the coming days.<\/p><p>I recognise that there are concerns and criticisms about the reopening on the other side of the House.  Those who have knowledge of the sector, such as Senator Casey and others, recognise the significant pressure businesses, the majority of which are small family run businesses, are under.  They all agree that in the absence of being able to fully reopen that this is the best possible route to go down.  Other colleagues have mentioned mental health, which, as I know from talking to various people, is a significant concern.  We need to support people.  This is a temporary measure and, at the rate our vaccination programme is delivering, I hope that it will be very short-lived.  I look forward to a full resumption of indoor hospitality in the near future as we continue to emerge from Covid.<\/p><p>Other Senators raised the timeframe relating to antigen testing.

There was a marked difference between them and some of those made in the D&aacute;il.  I congratulated Deputy Bacik on entering the D&aacute;il but suggested to her that she would see some different styles of debate there compared with what that which obtains in the Seanad.  I thank everybody for a useful debate, which included much criticism that I listened to carefully and must take on board.<\/p> <p>I have a closing speech but I have taken many notes and would prefer to try to address the various themes that were raised.  The first of those relates to solidarity.  We all want solidarity.  When I was talking to Dr. Mike Ryan from the WHO last year, he said that Ireland is distinguished internationally by the level of political and social solidarity we have shown.  He said that it is one reason we will come out of this with one of the lowest mortality and case rates.  It is critical that we have solidarity.  I have been talking to many unvaccinated people about these proposals.  They have said that we can open up and get tens of thousands of people back to work tomorrow.  The unvaccinated people say they can still go for dinner or for a drink but will have a drink in the beer garden and if that means that tens of thousands of people can get back to work, including many of their friends, then we should do it now.  They say that people have been out of work for a year and a half and that we should get them back to work.  They tell me that all I am asking them to do is drink in the beer garden and it is no problem.  That is what solidarity means.  It means taking a hit for the greater good and for other people.<\/p> <p>Some people here and in the D&aacute;il suggest that solidarity means that if they cannot have something, then nobody should be allowed to have it.  That is not what solidarity involves.  I have not met any unvaccinated person who has said that because it is not how people outside this bubble think.  People outside this bubble think that we are doing great.  We are faced with a significant wave of the Delta variant.  Unvaccinated people say that this has been a horrible experience for our country but that if we can get tens of thousands of men and women back to work, then let us do so and that all they have to do is to wait until they get the Janssen vaccine at their local pharmacy or the Pfizer vaccine at a vaccination centre, which is not a problem.  That is what solidarity means.<\/p> <p>The only Senator who I will refer to directly is Senator Mullen.  I will not take any lectures from Senator Mullen, who campaigned against gay marriage.  He can keep his lectures on solidarity to himself.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#DD00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":204,"content":"<p>So health discrimination is all right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#DD00400","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":206,"content":"<p>What about staff?  People are saying, as an act of solidarity, to let everyone into the pubs.  Think about that for a second.  They are saying to put people's lives at risk as an act of solidarity.  We have to be careful when we talk about solidarity.  Outside of this place, people get what this means.<\/p> <p>Some contributors stated that this is not enforceable.  At the same time, however, they tabled amendments to bring in things like antigen testing, which would make it much harder to enforce.  Pubs and restaurants are capable of asking people their age before they serve them a drink.  They are capable of engaging with people and asking to see their proof of vaccination.  Here is mine.  At the top of the Covid tracker application is my QR code.  It is no more complicated than that.  Senator Casey asked if pubs and restaurants are capable of keeping their staff and patrons safe.  Of course they are.  In the not too distant past, pubs would not let you in if they did not like your shoes.  They could refuse admission based on nothing more than saying \"Look at the head on you\".  They are capable of asking to look at a person's QR code.  Workers and their safety are absolutely being considered.  I will be clear that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representative groups for the sector were in the room.  They do not like all of it.  None of us, including me, like all of it.  The representative groups and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said that we have serious priorities on this.  We have to ensure that the protocols are fully enforced but they are willing to go along with it because it gets tens of thousands of men and women back to work, which we are trying to do.<\/p> <p>We are not discriminating against people.  We are differentiating.  Differentiation is already in place in the context of international travel.  Whether a person is fully vaccinated matters.  When we brought that in, nobody suggested that it was discriminatory.  People said that was based on what is safe or not.  Under-18s are not allowed to be served alcohol in our pubs and restaurants.  I do not think anybody here would argue that that is discriminatory.  We say that is the case because it is safe.  You are not allowed to smoke inside but that is not discriminatory.  It is a public health measure to keep people safe.  This is a public health measure to keep people safe.  Unvaccinated people who I have spoken to get that.  The only place that this does not seem to resonate is in the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>I hate the phrase, but when people who are 70 or older were asked to cocoon on public health grounds to keep them safe, I never heard one voice individual say that was discriminatory and that, as a result, the entire country would have to cocoon because we had to implement all the measures together.  We do not and we never have.  People aged 70 and over had to isolate in order to keep themselves safe.  Unvaccinated people need to keep out of the restaurants for a short period to keep themselves safe.  No one suggested that younger people should cocoon as an act of solidarity with those in their 70s.  People have had to do different things right from the start of this pandemic based on safety and none of it is fair.  There is nothing fair about this virus or the fact that it kills more older people than younger people.  There is nothing fair for countries all over the world which cannot get their hands on vaccines while we are using 300,000 a week.  There is nothing fair about this pandemic.  It is brutal and ugly but we are all trying to do our best.<\/p> <p>Several Senators have reasonably asked how bad it could get.

We do not know that yet.  What response will there be from society?  Will we have the same level of response as we had the last time?  I hope so but we do not know.  We do not know how bad it will get but there are things we do know.  We know there were 1,000 cases yesterday and there will be approximately 1,200 cases today.  We know the numbers in hospital have doubled in the past three weeks and that because of exponential growth, they will continue to double.  I was talking to Philip Nolan this morning about more than 200 people being in intensive care in a few months and that I was beginning to talk through with the Department that we will have to start up building up additional surge capacity for ICU now in case it happens.  These are things we do know.   We know the range given for fatalities for just three months is between 335 and 1,760.  In the War of Independence approximately 2,300 people died.  That puts in context what the deaths of 1,760 people would mean.  We must do everything we can to push that down.  <\/p><p>Reasonable questions have been asked regarding the use of PCR and antigen testing.  The Government's approach is a phased one.  The Bill provides for the possibility of using PCR and antigen testing.  People who are concerned about that should have no issue voting for the Bill.  We must bear in mind how contagious the Delta variant is, that case numbers are roaring and the spike in cases.  I want to share with colleagues, as soon as I can, the data I saw this morning on the infection rate for the 16- to 18-year-old group.  That group is now at the same infection rate as at the peak in the October wave and the line is vertical on the page.  The line is also vertical for the 19- to 24-year-old group.  There are very quick infection rates for these groups.  Thank God most of them will be fine because of their age but they will not all be fine.  Many of them will get long Covid and we are only beginning to understand that.  The situation is very serious.  We are taking a cautious approach.  Might we use PCR and antigen testing in the future?  Yes, and that is facilitated in the Bill.  We should remember a PCR test can take about five days to be detect the virus, from the day the person is infected until the day it can detect the virus.  If a person gets infected on a Wednesday and, in good faith, gets tested on the Friday and has a negative PCR test, that person may well be contagious shortly after that, and may go out to restaurants and bars on a Friday night, the Saturday night or the Sunday night carrying this super contagious variant.  We are taking an approach where we may well use PCR and antigen testing but not yet.  We are watching what is happening in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Cyrus.  We will be cautious abut this and we will do it in the safest way possible.  That is why the Bill is structured as it is.  It is possible in the regulation to bring testing in. <\/p><p>I will finish on this point and I thank the Leas-Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  I do not want this legislation; none of us wants it.  My hope is that long before the three-month period expires at which time this legislation will automatically fall, we will not need it because we will have reached a level of vaccination and people will have continued to follow the public health measures to such an extent the risk profile falls and we can all get back to living normal lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#DD00800","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":210,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

This requirement is in place regardless of where they travelled from, unless they are exempt &ndash; for example if they have received the full course of a vaccine that has been authorised by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.<\/p> <p>Mandatory hotel quarantine has been in operation since 26 March and is an exceptional and temporary measure.  It continues to be an important safeguard in managing the risk of importation of cases and variants of concern.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A single service provider is providing full board accommodation services to guests in facilities designated exclusively for the purpose of quarantine, as well as ground transportation, security services and health and well-being services for guests within its facilities.<\/p><p>The provisions of the Act allow travellers to request a review of decisions relating to their quarantine.  This can only be undertaken once quarantine has begun and on a limited number of grounds.  Reviews are conducted by independent appeals officers and a seven-day-a-week service is provided.  Decisions must be returned within 24 hours of receipt of the request for review.  Requests for review are based on the specific grounds established in the law.  <\/p><p>A notice of rights and obligations is provided to passengers on arrival in the State, usually by the first team to encounter relevant passengers.  Medical services are available on-site, 24-7.  It is also possible for a person to leave quarantine in the case of a medical emergency and to attend urgent medical appointments.  Special arrangements have been made to allow those seeking international protection or unaccompanied minors to undertake their quarantine in alternative appropriate circumstances.<\/p><p>Up to 13 July, 8,420 people have quarantined in designated facilities.  Latest figures show that 376 residents have tested positive for Covid-19.  Cases were recorded in travellers from 35 countries.  If these people had not been in mandatory hotel quarantine, it is likely to have resulted in a significant number of additional cases in the community.  We know that variants of concern are being identified in mandatory hotel quarantine and without it, there is a risk that new variants could be imported and would not be identified.  In addition, many countries have been unable to adequately monitor new variants, which adds to the risk of circulation.  Mandatory hotel quarantine is creating space for the continued great progress of our vaccination system.  We can be proud that 5 million vaccines have now been administered.  Despite the significant challenges of the HSE cyberattack, as of 15 July, more than 2.72 million people have received a first dose and more than 2.2 million people are fully vaccinated.<\/p><p>Currently, 61 states are designated on a risk assessment based on Covid incidence rates and variants of concern.  We are all keenly aware of the rapidly evolving nature of this pandemic.  There is flexibility built into the mandatory hotel quarantine system to allow it to adapt to any changes in context, particularly with the system for the designation and revocation of states.  We need to have mandatory hotel quarantine in place in the coming months to allow for further progress on our vaccination programme.  Mandatory hotel quarantine will not be in place for any longer than is necessary to protect public health.  It is important to have it in place right now as we re-open our society, economy and international travel while dealing, at the same time, with the situation of cases we were discussing earlier this morning. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#HH00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":217,"content":"<p>It is good to see the senior Minister coming into the House to discuss these important issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#JJ00200","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":218,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#JJ00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for introducing this motion today.

I echo the Acting Chairman's observations on the Minister's presence here.  It speaks volume and he is always very welcome.<\/p> <p>We do not necessarily want to extend this legislation because nobody wants to quarantine people who are coming to our country.  This is a country where the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte is something that we are very proud of but unfortunately, due to the public health emergency, it is necessary.  I repeat what I said earlier on; we have managed this pandemic exceptionally well.  Sadly, and unfortunately, more than 5,000 people have lost their lives in this country as a result of this pandemic but it could have been much worse.  Had we not taken what could be described as draconian measures and done all that we did, many thousands more would have died.  We must look at what has happened in the UK with the situation of people who have, sadly, died and the number of those who have contracted Covid there.  That is a salutary lesson in terms of what we are doing and the reasons for it.<\/p> <p>We have one of the strictest mandatory quarantine regimes in Europe and it is working.  Sadly, this virus can be imported very easily.  I commend the people who are managing the hotel quarantine system - it is certainly not easy - and, by and large, they are doing a good job.  I also acknowledge the citizens who freely entered mandatory hotel quarantine because they knew it was the right thing to do even though it cost them to do so.  The vast majority of them did it because they knew it was the right thing to do and they were buying into the meitheal that we are all involved with in dealing with this disease.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, we will be faced with a significant Delta wave of this virus in the months of August and September.  We, therefore, must support this motion and extend the relevant period.  As the Minister has quite rightly said, it will not be in existence a day longer than it is needed.  It is just another measure in the suite of measures that the Government has introduced to support people.<\/p> <p>The simple messages must always be articulated.  We all have a part to play in this.  The Government, the medical profession and the front-line workers can only do so much.  Each citizen of this country must remain focused on doing what he or she has been doing, including not meeting unnecessarily, keeping a safe distance apart, following basic hygiene measures, wearing masks and not letting one's guard down.  We did it in the first lockdown and we have continued to do it.  While we will get to the end of this pandemic, it requires buy-in from everybody.  As we break up for the summer holidays, I encourage everybody in the country to continue this united effort against the pandemic to save as many lives as we possibly can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#JJ00500","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":221,"content":"<p>Senator Keogan had wished to change slots with Senator Boylan but she is not here.

As nearly 5 million vaccines have been administered, which the Minister has overseen, we have to think about where this will end.  England will lift its restrictions on Monday.  Similarly, Scotland will move to level 0.  In Wales, formal social distancing rules are set to come to an end on 7 August.  Northern Ireland is ahead of us.  What is so different about us?

As Senators, we spend some time scrutinising legislation.  It is not easy for many of us, particularly those of us who may not be from a legal background.

It probably quite rightly belongs in the realm of draconian measures.  In my humble opinion and following advice, however, it is absolutely necessary.  I and the Green Party grouping in Seanad &Eacute;ireann will, therefore, support this in the interests of safety for all.<\/p> <p>As the Minister said previously, no Minister enjoys or relishes introducing such measures but they have at their heart the public health considerations.  In the context of the immediately preceding debate on indoor hospitality, this one is far more draconian in its make-up.  At least in the previous one, a person can still enjoy dining or a drink outside.  People do not have that choice in respect of this.  They do not have that choice in certain circumstances.  One just cannot board an aeroplane because there is obviously no outdoor terrace facility on the wing of an aeroplane.  It would be very breezy, cold and dangerous.  It is part of the overall jigsaw of protecting people.<\/p> <p>In my humble opinion, it engages civil rights issues.  Civil rights advocates are perfectly within their remit to question these.  We live in a democracy.  This is in line with public health advice, however.  I agree when the Minister and a previous speaker, Senator Conway, said solidarity is at the heart of this.  The Minister said in the previous debate that differentiation is different from discrimination.  Perhaps I am one of the privileged ones who can now, for instance, dine or have a drink or meal inside.  It sounds a little bit like tokenism to decide to stay outside, although no one should hold their breath because any prolific socialising days I had are long since over with having young children.  I am going to try to make it outdoors, however, to stand with those who just cannot get indoors at the moment.  It is a short-term, measured balance, which is not ideal.  It is either that, however, or up to 160,000 or more jobs are on the line that we will never get back.<\/p> <p>This is, therefore, all about proportionality and reasonableness.  It is a measured, pragmatic approach that no one relishes but it must be done.  As I said, therefore, I confirm that the Green Party grouping is happy to support this motion.  We make no apologies for seeking it to come back before the House today.  I do not mean this pejoratively but in a sense, I would categorise it as draconian.  It was, therefore, a good balance and checks exercise in a legislative assembly democracy to bring it back to renew it.  Doing that will instil confidence among the people of Ireland that it is not an unfettered, unbridled power that will run away on people.  I can assure the people concerned that each and every legislator here is firmly keeping his or her eyes on this and monitoring the situation.  We do not enjoy introducing such measures but if the expert advice tells us we should do it, I, for one, will not depart from such advice.<\/p> <p>I commend the Minister on the continued roll-out of the vaccination programme, which is like a campaign at this stage.  He is a campaigning Minister.  I am hoping, in a few weeks' time, we will see a huge seismic turn for the better in this whole campaign.  As the Minister well knows, vaccination is key.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#KK00200","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister a series of questions about people who have been fully vaccinated with WHO-approved vaccines but not EMA-approved vaccines and who are still required to go into mandatory hotel quarantining.  When will people who have to travel for medical reasons and do not fall into the current exemptions be provided for?<\/p> <p>I would also like to get a bit of clarity about how countries are designated and removed from the list.  I see it as being quite vague and I would like to see more transparency.  As the global north becomes more vaccinated, the overwhelming majority of countries on the red list will be poorer countries and countries in the global south.  Hotel quarantine will, therefore, impact people travelling from Africa, Asia and Latin America and disproportionately affect people of colour.<\/p> <p>I will take a moment to reiterate the call for patents to be removed on Covid-19 vaccines in order that we can boost production, stop new variants emerging and stand with our brothers and sisters across the globe.  They will view the position of Ireland and the European Commission, which are in the hands of big pharma, as a betrayal and it will not be forgotten.  It does not bode well for the series of challenges we face in our world, particularly climate change.<\/p> <p>How much is mandatory hotel quarantine currently costing the Exchequer?  How much will it cost as a result of the extension into October?  This is obviously a very privatised system that relies on big hotel groups in this way.

The regulation, which is set out and available online, essentially states that urgent critical care is covered.  If there are other areas Senator Warfield wants to talk to me about afterwards, I am more than happy to give him a view.<\/p> <p>The Senator asked how the states are designated.  Global analysis is carried out on a rolling basis of states all over the world.  Two main criteria are used.  One is variants of concern and whether they are detected.  Many countries in which it is highly likely there are variants of concern do not have, for example, the whole genome-sequencing facilities that we have.  The other is where there are very high incidence rates.  They are the two main criteria.  Essentially, I get a letter from the Chief Medical Officer laying out the current global situation and outlining what states he proposes are to be designated or dedesignated because states are coming off the list as well.  That is how that works.  If the Senator would like a more detailed note on that, I would be more than happy to get that for him. <\/p> <p>I agree with the Senator fully in terms of the need for a global vaccine solution.  I do not believe there is a silver bullet.  Some very good analysis has been done looking at the supply chain right the way from raw ingredients, some of which are an issue, through to manufacturing, which is very complex.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Ireland had a very significant amount of vaccine withheld from us because of manufacturing questions raised in the US by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  Even in countries with highly sophisticated pharmaceutical manufacturing capability it does not always go right.  Supply chains and logistics are also a concern.  Some friends of mine working in developing nations are involved in this.  One, who is looking at this in an African country, told me that due to the refrigeration and transport requirements for the mRNA vaccines which are quite delicate compounds, it would be very difficult to successfully and safely roll these things out.  There are many issues.  <\/p><p>I have been advised that waivers and various mechanisms are possible in terms of other countries manufacturing compounds that do not require broad IP waivers.  I noted that President Biden called for it.  I said in the D&aacute;il that it was a good idea given the current situation.  I am happy to repeat that again today.  However, an IP waiver will not solve the problem.  There is a whole supply chain that must be dealt with.  I agree that we will be judged, and we should be judged, on whether or not we play our part as global citizens.  The last information I saw showed that Europe as a region had exported more vaccines to other countries than any other part of the world.  That is something we need to continue to push on.  <\/p><p>I am very happy to provide a note on the costs of mandatory hotel quarantine.  I spoke about active cases in my opening statement.  There are 376 positive tests at this point.<\/p><p>I thank the Senators for their contributions and the House for its support.  This is a bit like the debate we just had on the hospitality sector in that none of us wants to be here debating it.  None of us wants to be in a world where we need mandatory hotel quarantine or where there are stipulations on what is safe or not safe to do in restaurants and pubs.  It is one of the things that is necessary.  Ireland has taken a leading role on mandatory hotel quarantine in Europe.  We have the most comprehensive protections in place.  If we look at its effectiveness against various variants, we were talking about variants in Brazil, South Africa and other places but they fell off dramatically once we introduced mandatory hotel quarantine so it has worked.  We are seeing the damage that variants can do.  I thank the House for what is again hopefully a temporary extension to the system to keep people safe while we reach higher levels of full vaccination which we need to achieve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#KK00400","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":228,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1626424200,"counter":229,"content":"<p>Sitting suspended at 3.24 p.m. and resumed at 3.30 p.m.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Teachtaireacht \u00f3n D\u00e1il - Message from D\u00e1il","time":1626424200,"counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The following message has been received from D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:<\/p> <blockquote> \tD&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has agreed, on this 14th day of July 2021, to amendments 1 to 7, made by Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.<br \/><br \/>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has made the following amendment consequential upon the acceptance of amendments 3 and 6:  \tIn page 8, line 19, to delete &ldquo;6, 6B&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;6, 6A, 6B&rdquo;. to which the agreement of Seanad &Eacute;ireann is desired. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00200","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021: Motion","time":1626424200,"counter":232,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00300"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat the Seanad so agree to the amendment made by the D&aacute;il consequential on its agreement to Seanad amendments No. 3 and 6. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00400","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00500","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am very glad we are back in the Seanad for what I hope is the final phase of the passing of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021.

My heart is full of hope for the first time in a long time.  A lot of work has been done to get us this far.  Input has come from every angle and everybody, from green schools to NGOs.  Many people have been involved in many ways.  There was a citizens' assembly on climate change.  Today represents a win for everyone.<\/p> <p>From my own rural perspective, I see farmers with too much fodder one year and not enough the next.  We had to import fodder two years in a row.  Farmers were cutting hay outside Shannon Airport when there were extreme weather conditions.  There are extreme weather patterns.  That is what climate change is.  It is extreme weather patterns that are changing and unpredictable.  We saw the devastation in Germany over recent days.  Climate change has come home.  It has never been too far away.  It is not just about it being something that is an issue elsewhere.  It is here and it is going to affect everybody in every way.<\/p> <p>This Bill is finally putting in place structures in this country that will have to be followed in every single Department in every way to ensure we do all we can to protect this country of ours.  We must protect not just the environment but the people who live here so that they are ready to face the challenges associated with extreme weather conditions.  Lots of land near where I live has been flooded repeatedly, which means cattle cannot feed and farmers have to keep their cattle inside for longer.  The issues have affected me greatly at a rural level, which is why I got into politics, to be honest.  I was always an environmental activist and did a lot of human rights work.  Then I realised climate change is also a local issue.  Perhaps that is not always understood.  This Bill is going to change everything in every way but it is for the greater good.  We have seen the destruction of our water, wildlife and farm life.  Everything has deteriorated because of climate change and the change in weather patterns.  Farmers often contact me to ask if rules can be changed because, previously, you could only do some work during the summer but now that does not work anymore.  We have all seen our weather patterns becoming much more erratic.<\/p> <p>Actions speak louder than words. This Bill is a huge win for environmental activists who have thrown their hat into the political ring to see if they can make a difference inside as well as outside the system.  I have often attended protests outside the gates of Leinster House.  I went to a Shut Down Sellafield event.  I started the Fracking Free Clare campaign.  It has been a risk for me to see if we can affect change on the inside as well.  There is still a lot of scepticism about what happens inside these gates.  Some of that scepticism is lost when I see this valuable climate Bill being passed.  I look forward to seeing the President of Ireland signing this very important Bill into law, not just for nature, but for all the people of this country.  I thank the Minister and the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and all the parties and the Opposition, who put in a lot of work, did late nights and scrutinised the legislation to ensure this is the strongest and most useful Bill with which to serve the people as we face this significant challenge of the climate emergency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00800","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I remind Senators we must finish this item by 4.03 p.m., and that includes the Minister's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#MM00900","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and the message from the D&aacute;il in regard to section 6A.  It was an oversight.  Albeit some may say it was not strictly needed, I think it ties up the entire Bill really well.  It was always the intention of the Government, in drafting this Bill, to ensure that Ireland is obliged not just to meet its international obligations, but to go beyond that in many instances and to be consistent with those international obligations in regard to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Paris Agreement.  That is what this amendment is about.  It is about ensuring that everything the Minister and the Government do is related back to and consistent with our international obligations.  I do not think anybody could have any difficulty with that.<\/p> <p>I was very disappointed, to be honest, with some of the commentary, particularly in the D&aacute;il.  The amendments that this House put before the D&aacute;il included amendments around just transition and around responding to the Stop Climate Chaos request to remove the definition we had of climate justice, yet most of the Opposition voted against those amendments, as well as the other amendments.  I would argue that the amendment we put down in regard to ensuring that the Government had to have regard to EU rules was the correct one because there was nothing to preclude us from having regulations around our accounting, whereas those rules now have to be consistent with the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, thanks to this amendment, and have to have regard to the EU rules.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister for bringing forward all of these things.  As Senator Garvey said, this is momentous.  The Green party has worked on this for more than 40 years, as have environmentalists.  This is one of the most ambitious Bills across the globe; it is objectively seen as such and most environmentalists have also said it is one of the most ambitious.  Fundamentally, at its very heart, it is about reaching zero emissions by 2050 and, regardless of any of the amendments, that one thing is going to be challenging for us.  What this Bill does is to strengthen an advisory council that will advise us in coming up with carbon budgets and climate action plans, and also, very significantly, strengthen all of the public participation that has to go into coming up with those plans.<\/p> <p>As I said, some of the commentary has been very disappointing.  A particular party, Sinn F&eacute;in, actually put forward a budget last year that did not even mention climate, bar mentioning the name of the Department.  Let us recognise the fact and the work that this Government and the Green Party has done for those decades in coming up with this.  We would absolutely not be as enthusiastic and excited about this if it was not as ambitious as it is, and if we had not put a year into drafting this, but there are also the decades behind the work we have done, across all of the environmental movements in which we have all been involved and in which our children have been involved.  Let us celebrate today because it is a good day.  I would question anyone who would say that it is not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#NN00100","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I remind Senators they have three minutes apiece.

He has been dogged in his approach.  He has had electoral success and failure along the way, but it never thwarted his vision or his ambition to achieve it.  When he started out on that relatively lonely journey, he and others in his party were considered to be &ldquo;tree huggers&rdquo;, and other comments were passed that were less complimentary, perhaps, but he has made it a mainstream issue.  Like so many other things in politics, as a citizen, he was ahead of where politics was at the time.  To some extent, the citizens have caught up with the Minister and caught up with this agenda so that, now, it is everyone's idea and everybody is an expert on this area but, without a doubt, he has been a pioneer in this House.<\/p> <p>What I have found in my interaction with the Minister is that he has never taken a fundamentalist approach.  He has been prepared to listen to sectors of society because, from the outset, he understood that climate change had to be for everyone.  It was not for the academics, the environmentalists or the lobby.  It had to be made mainstream, and he has done that in his own, very professional way.  He has engaged with groups with which he might have had disagreements, and he brought a central plank of understanding around what we have to do.  By signing up to the Paris Agreement, as we did, and by the continued efforts right across society in continuing to lobby, even when he was outside this House, he has made it possible and real.<\/p> <p>It is not going to be easy.  Anybody who thinks the passage of the Bill is the job done would be missing the point.  It will take continued vigilance around the Cabinet table to ensure that every line Department, notwithstanding the vested interests, meets its challenge head-on.  Even in the announcement he was part of yesterday in the midlands, the Minister has shown that for an industry like Bord na M&oacute;na, the devastation of the area that was expected from a progressive climate policy does not have to be such.  He has always said that we must look to the opportunities, and they are there.  They are there in the constituency of Clare, where it was very difficult to get the ESB to move on Moneypoint.  With a change of thinking in the Department and a new Minister with a different vision, lo and behold, it was able to pull out plans that I am sure it had been working on for some time in terms of the capture of offshore wind in the Atlantic Ocean, with no impact on homes, which is a difficulty with onshore wind.  The real opportunity for Moneypoint now comes out of the opportunity to develop a base level for the creation of green hydrogen and the impact that will have, because it is only in the early stages.<\/p> <p>I had the pleasure to participate, with other Members of the House, in a demonstration by Bus &Eacute;ireann just this week of three hydrogen powered buses that it is testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#NN00300","speaker":"1655"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>I am conscious of time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#NN00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I will wrap up.

It is amazing to look at the trajectory of climate action politics over the last ten or 20 years.  Ten to 20 years ago, this type of stuff was on the fringe of political debate and it is now mainstream.  This is exactly why politicians of all political parties campaign, namely, to get into government, to introduce the ideas they campaign on and to have landmark, lasting legislation that will stand the test of time.  I have no doubt this is landmark legislation.  The most important thing about it, and I have no doubt about this, is that in 20 or 30 years, when we look at legislation that has been passed by the Oireachtas in those years, this will be right up there with the top legislation that has been passed.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John McGahon:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have now become so ambitious, we are a world leader when it comes to climate action and I think the Government will be absolutely commended on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#NN01000","speaker":"1670","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I ended our previous debate on this Bill by saying Ireland is starting late and we should be starting stronger and I begin by saying that again.  We are not world leaders on climate action yet; we are laggards still.  The test is still to come.  We should be starting stronger.  Members are right that the work is still ahead of us.  I think we could have made that work easier with a stronger Bill.  We could have been stronger on the definitions of \"climate justice\" and \"just transition\".  The test now will be for the Government to prove itself on action in those areas since it did not insert strong definitions into the Bill.  The test will be on action and it will be watched carefully.  The limited liability clause creates greater vulnerability for all those persons, small businesses and farmers across the country who will be and are being impacted by climate change.  The opportunity to limit liability in respect of international investors was not taken.  It will be really important that we oppose any extra hostages to fortune in respect of the chilling effect of international investors through the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, or the investment court system, ICS.  The language is still not as strong as it could be, and the interpretation of phrases such as \"as far as practicable\" will be really important.  We have heard assurances from the Minister as to how he sees this, but it will be important to see how all the bodies and all the Ministers will use such phrases, and that will require attention.<\/p> <p>The opportunity to stop any new petroleum licences or leases was not taken and they are still allowed under this Bill.  The opportunity to ban LNG was not seized either.<\/p> <p>The final piece we have here, the amendment before us and section 6A, comes following the last-minute amendments last week.  When those amendments came through last week, as I looked at them for the very first time the day they were presented to us, I identified a few issues.  There were two or three issues with the content of the amendments the Government put forward.  I highlighted those issues at that time.  Subsequently, it very quickly became clear that there were also problems with where the amendments were to be inserted.  Finally, there were problems with what we might call the safety net clause of the Bill, namely section 3(3).  Again, it is not as strong a safety net as we would have wished.  It did not apply to those provisions.  It is not as strong a safety net as it could be.  It refers only to some articles of the UNFCC and only some articles of the Paris Agreement.  I am glad, however, that the safety net will at least apply to this new Government function.  However, the other problems - the ones I identified and the other ones which I did not identify when I saw the amendments first - still apply.  There is the concern that the Bill mentions lots of greenhouses gases, determining the greenhouse gas emissions, which does not rule out the idea of the exclusion of certain greenhouse gas emissions.  That is still a concern.  There is the fact that the Government would only have regard to the European rules rather than being consistent with them.  I mentioned in the debate at that time the concern about the UN procedures and rules.  The ultimate target compliance is not the same as compliance with best evolving practice.  Finally, there is the question of the baseline year.  Those were the issues of concern the last time we debated the Bill.<\/p> <p>The other issue which is a key concern is the location of the text to be inserted, and that is what gives rise to this amendment.  These regulations were not regulations the Government was making for itself in how it approaches things.  The amendments relating to removals that I tabled went to the definitions section of the Bill and related to how the Government might approach its removals.  They were inserted into the section where the independent advisory council sits.  I have raised my concern about a political requirement to reach only 51% less than the annual greenhouse gas emissions reported for the year ending on 31 December 2018 and not more being placed on the advisory council telling it what conclusion to come to for 2030.  Now these regulations, by being located in section 6A, also tell the advisory council how to do it, what answer to get to and how to get there.  Those are real concerns.  I note that these are not ministerial guidelines and I know the Minister will intend to use them with the absolute best intent, but they are Government guidelines and Government regulations.  That is a concern.  We have now created a new space where we will have to be vigilant and where attention will have to be paid.  It creates a tension because the UNFCC already applied to what the climate advisory council was doing under subsection (9), as did best international practice.  The concern was always what happens when the ball bounces out of the advisory council's court and into the Government's.  The amendments I proposed the last time the Bill was before us, specifically amendment No. 9, would have meant that the Government in its removal would have the same constraint the advisory council has, which was best international practice.  As the Bill now stands, the advisory council will be torn between its obligations to best international practice, with which it must be consistent, and its obligation to comply with the Government regulations.  We can hope that the Government regulations and best international practice might be the same, but that will be a very serious test now.  It is very important that there would be a signal such that where there is any conflict, best international practice will take precedence.  The members of the advisory council are there as experts, and that will be crucial and an area for testing.<\/p> <p>I am glad section 6A is being inserted into section 3(3).  I will support the amendment because it deals with one of the three layers of problems we have, but the other problems remain to be addressed.  I wish we had taken the opportunity to strengthen this more, to make it more progressive and to accept progressive amendments rather than seeking to dilute in any sense or to move power away from the advisory council and from the Minister.  We could have been stronger going in, and there were progressive proposals that we were told could not be accepted because the Bill was as strong as it could be, but then it got a little weaker.  I hope the Minister will engage with progressive proposals.  He will note that he did not have to weaken the Bill to get support in the D&aacute;il but that when he weakened the Bill he lost support in the D&aacute;il.  I ask him to engage actively with those in the Opposition, not just those who are worried or concerned about climate action but also those who are passionately demanding more ambitious climate action.  Let us move forward on this together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#OO00200","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":251,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose today's amendment by the Minister to the climate Bill as we too welcome the inclusion of 6A into section 3(3).  However, its inclusion does not allay all our concerns about the Seanad amendments that were adopted in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday night.  I continue to share the concerns of Professor John Sweeney that their inclusion undermines the scientific basis of the Bill and potentially leaves this Government and future governments hostage to lobbyists and interest groups rather than following best international practice.  I also share his concerns about the independence of the Climate Change Advisory Council in making its budgets.  In the Minister's defence of the amendments in the D&aacute;il debate he referred to Article 5 of the Paris Agreement, but the climate Bill does not refer to Article 5.  It refers only to Articles 2 and 4(1), so why did the Minister not include Article 5 in his amendment to give even further reassurance to those of us who want the most progressive, most robust climate Bill?<\/p> <p>The climate Bill will pass today and, despite the concerns raised, is at least far superior legislation than the first draft we were presented with in October.

The battle to ensure that climate justice and a just transition are front and centre in any climate action continues.  That means no investor clauses in treaties and that the communities and households that have borne the brunt of the costs of climate action will be protected.  The design of the PSO levy is a perfect example of an area in which we could help households.  We have energy-guzzling data centres that are not contributing while households carry the bulk of the cost of introducing renewables and grid upgrades.  I will work with the Minister and the Government to reform the PSO levy to make it fairer and more just.  Today, the EU has said that it is going to exclude private jets from its aviation tax.  What is the Minister's position on that?  As I said, we will work with the Government when necessary but we ask that the Government also work with those of us who are on its side and who are its allies in opposition to achieve the best climate action possible so that Ireland will no longer be a laggard.

I thank all Members of the Oireachtas.  We will work together.  This is our common goal.  It is does not belong to anyone.  I heard each Senator say that.  We will now work together to implement this.  That will be key.  The approach will be collaborative.  It will not work if everyone is not working together.  This is a leap of such scale that it will not work if we do it in a divisive way.  We have to work collaboratively as we implement what we are committing to here.  What we are committing to is no small change.  It is a great challenge.<\/p> <p>I am inspired by one small thing.  Senator Dooley and I were in Offaly yesterday, visiting a Bord na M&oacute;na facility where 850 new jobs are to be created.  Before we did that, we went out on the bog in the morning.  There was a digger blocking an open drain that had been put in place to extract the peat.  The fella operating the digger had previously worked extracting the peat.  It was the same really skilful job.  He was very happy for his skills to be used in this new way.  We then went out on the bog.  It was incredible.  This bog has been undergoing rehabilitation for 15 or 20 years.  It takes time but, as you walk out, you can sense that nature is coming back.  Nature is strong if we give it space to restore itself.  I felt an incredible sense of hope because of the diversity of wildlife on that bog arising from its restoration.  We are going to pay farmers to use their skills to restore bogs.  While not every area is bog, we are going pay people well to skilfully manage land and our connection to it to get this right.  These are skilled tasks.<\/p> <p>From there, we went on to a large wind farm owned by Bord na M&oacute;na.  It gave me such hope.  We have an auction system for renewables and agreement was only reached in respect of this wind farm last October.  Some nine months later, &euro;100 million was being spent on the site, where 200 people were working.  It is quite big.  The local community is right behind it because they know and trust Bord na M&oacute;na.  They have been working with the company for 80 years.  It knows energy.  We are switching from chimneys to turbines.  We are creating in areas where we have an advantage.  We can and will be good at this.  It is going to be difficult and will require great skill, imagination and effort but, working collectively, we will do it.  I thank Senators of all parties for their help.  The Oireachtas committee had a very significant role in shaping this Bill, which I acknowledge.  It is strong and it will make us strong as we work together from here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#PP01000","speaker":"1465"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":274,"content":"<p>As I did the last time the Minister was in the House, I commend him.

I will address my other amendments later, but their purpose is to try to highlight issues related to the situation that is being addressed by the Bill.  Most of my other amendments relate to reports on important conversations we need to have.  This amendment is a little different in that it is something I suggest will be included in the review mechanism, not as a stand-alone report but as part of the five-year review.  The amendment raises questions regarding the Bill on an area that needs scrutiny.  The other issues relate to topics that build on what the Minister of State is doing, but this relates to financial abuse.<\/p><p>In a situation where one is setting up new financial mechanisms, where there is the appointment or naming of successors, for example, and the transfer of assets in the case not simply of a home but of companies and farms, it involves businesses, income and how it might be allocated from those businesses and farms.  In many cases, in this legislation we are dealing with vulnerable persons, who are particularly vulnerable to the point where they may be in need of long-term residential care.  It is important in all those situations that we would have extra vigilance, scrutiny and attention on issues concerning financial abuse.<\/p><p>In two of my former lives before the Oireachtas, I worked with Older &amp;amp; Bolder, which is a network of older persons' organisations throughout the country and for the Older Women's Network as part of that.  As I will come to later, I also worked with the National Women's Council.  I became aware during my work with all those organisations of the prevalence of elder abuse, in particular financial abuse.  Sometimes it is subtle, but there can be elements of coercion and the application of pressure or bullying.  I accept there are standard measures in the Bill that are appropriate safeguards under which people must appoint their successor or a person who is their care representative, but it would be appropriate that at the point of the five-year review, regardless of whether the Minister of State can accept this amendment, that there would be a careful eye to examine those questions of how these powers and mechanisms have been operated and if complaints, concerns or issues of financial abuse have arisen.<\/p><p>The Minister of State will be aware of the Civil Engagement Group, which is my group, and that in the previous Seanad, Colette Kelleher championed this area.  The Minister of State knows her well and worked closely with her on vulnerable people, including in the area of dementia and others.  The former Senator, Colette Kelleher, championed the legislation on adult safeguarding, which we are pressing for again.  My colleague, Senator Black, will focus on the area of adult safeguarding in the autumn.<\/p><p>I hope that this will not just be part of the five-year review, but that the Minister will be supportive of adult safeguarding legislation, which the Law Reform Commission and others have sought.  That legislation may have the potential to almost reach back into this legislation and related legislation on the fair deal and other financial processes.  It would be useful if that legislation was the way we would tackle the issues of safeguarding within this and other legislation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There are a few ways in which the Minister of State can support and engage with the amendment, and I hope she will be open to that.

Everybody will recognise that I have a history in that respect.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge concerns about safeguarding in nursing homes and the potential vulnerability of nursing home residents.  The nursing home sector has been severely challenged in the past 16 months and I think everybody recognises that.  Once again on the floor of the Seanad, I express my deepest condolences to the families of the more than 2,051 people in nursing homes who lost their lives.  In recent weeks, there has been media coverage of neglect in nursing homes, and to that end, in the past two weeks I met representatives of HIQA, residents of Ballynoe Nursing Home in Cork and their families.  Much active work on nursing homes is ongoing, although people might not be aware of it.<\/p> <p>I recognise that financial abuse of older people is a serious issue.  The majority of nursing home residents exhibit high levels of dependency and some form of capacity limitation, including dementia.  The assumption within the Bill, which is reflected in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, is that individuals in the scheme have full mental capacity until the contrary is established.  In such a case as a person is established not to have full mental capacity, a care representative can be established.  The Bill sets out the method by which a care representative is appointed and the function he or she can perform in making decisions related to the person&rsquo;s care.  The care representative must be appointed by a court.  Furthermore, the full implementation of the 2015 Act is expected to have an impact on this function, given that it is the Department&rsquo;s intention to ensure the fair deal legislation is aligned with this new legislation.<\/p> <p>A range of other individuals, including the care representative, can act as a specified person on behalf of a person in care.  Only the care representative, however, can represent a person in applying for ancillary support, that is, the nursing home loan, or in seeking the relief provided by the Bill in terms of appointing a successor to a productive asset.  That is because these processes involve the placement of a charge on the land.  Appropriate structures, therefore, are in place to ensure safeguards in the case of individuals without full capacity.<\/p> <p>The Bill, as drafted, will require the Minister to carry out a review of the operation of its provisions no later than five years after it comes into effect, which will be laid before the Oireachtas.  The terms of this review are not set out in any more specific detail.  We might expect, however, that it will cover any operational challenges, the policy impact and the cost to the State, as well as any unforeseen consequences in regard to areas such as financial abuse.  It would not be appropriate to extend the scope of this review far beyond the terms of the specific amendments to the legislation we are debating, nor would it be appropriate to single out financial abuse as the only specified issue for this review to consider.<\/p> <p>Turning to the adult safeguarding policy, the existing framework of standards, policies and procedures for the safeguarding of adults who may be at risk of abuse, harm or exploitation within the health sector includes the joint national adult safeguarding standards developed by HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, MHC, the significant inspection and other regulatory powers of HIQA and the MHC, and the structures and processes established by the HSE to support and further develop its national operational policy on safeguarding. <\/p> <p>Further measures are being developed to strengthen the adult safeguarding framework in the health system, including the revision of HSE operation policy and the development of a national policy on safeguarding in the health sector covering all settings.  This will address potential policy and legislative gaps, provide national direction and address relevant cross-sectoral issues such as information sharing.  Significant policy development work has been undertaken on this policy.  I acknowledge the work of my neighbour when we were based in Leinster House 2000, the then Senator Colette Kelleher.  An inter-sectoral steering group has been established, stakeholder consultation has been carried out and a large volume of evidence has been commissioned and gathered.  While I recognise the concerns raised by the Senator, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#SS00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":284,"content":"<p>In spirit, I agree with the amendment.  Nevertheless, while the review will be some time away and we will see who is in charge at that point, the Minister of State will have built sufficient protections into the Bill through the work she is doing on capacity and in other areas.  Financial abuse of the elderly is certainly something for which we need to be watchful, but with the HSE's safeguarding policy that has been in place since 2014, the requirements are already included in general policy and application.  Furthermore, movements are being made in respect of the commencement of legislation including the amending Bill that the Minister of State is bringing through.<\/p> <p>Financial abuse is not the only area; other areas, too, need to be considered.  To single out one area would be to highlight it disproportionately, given that there are other means by which the elderly and vulnerable need to have the assurance of respect, and not merely in financial abuse.  From that point of view, focusing on one would almost elevate it above others, when in fact we need to ensure that any review will deal with everything with regard to respect for, and the well-being of, the vulnerable people at the core of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#SS00300","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":285,"content":"<p>We will engage on adult safeguarding in the autumn, an issue that needs to be progressed.  As well as the review and the body of evidence, we will need legislation on that.  Financial abuse is highlighted in the amendment because it is setting in place a different financial mechanism for successors and capping.  Safeguarding with nursing homes, as was mentioned, is a key issue, as is capacity.  I am glad the Minister of State is engaged and has a personal passion for those areas.<\/p> <p>The issue of financial abuse is a little wider because it is not simply about capacity; it is also about issues such as coercion that are not about capacity but the particular vulnerabilities in households, and some of my later amendments will come to that.  It may be about the person being pressed to name somebody as his or her successor, or a spouse or a sibling who finds himself or herself in financially vulnerable circumstances and subject to exploitation.  There is an entire area of financial abuse where people might well have capacity but not the independence, and they may be vulnerable in those other senses.  That is why there is a general reference to other kinds of abuse.  Financial abuse is an important part, given that, unfortunately, finances can be used as a tool of coercion and control, and that is why it needs to be highlighted.<\/p> <p>Overall, this is a progressive Bill.  It will allow farms and businesses to pass on.  Nevertheless, a wealth of literature in Ireland tells us how fraught that can be, and how there can be casualties if we do not pay attention.  Seamus Heaney wrote about the local wars in that regard and how important they can be.  It is an area about which we need to be very careful because hurt can be caused.  I understand that the Minister of State might not be able to accept the amendment, and in any event the D&aacute;il has adjourned for the summer, so the Bill cannot be further amended for now, but I hope we can engage in respect of safeguarding and the wider area of financial abuse.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is important groundwork.

A key principle of safeguarding is that it is everybody's business and all healthcare professionals have key roles in the prevention and reporting of abuse.  However, the essential role of social workers in safeguarding is recognised.  The specialised safeguarding and protection teams in each of the nine community healthcare organisation areas are managed and led by principal social workers and staffed by social work team leaders with professionally qualified social workers.  These teams provide a range of safeguarding functions from direct case management to quality assurance, as well as oversight and support to all service providers, including those funded by the HSE.<\/p> <p>Community support teams, as recommended by the nursing home expert panel, will be implemented across each community healthcare organisation and each of these teams will have access to dedicated social worker resources through enhancements of existing community safeguarding teams.

It relates to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  The Minister of State is aware of the report from the Ombudsman entitled Wasted Lives and the disgraceful position of young people with disabilities placed in long-term residential care.  The committee heard some strong testimony and one important aspect was almost that we should stop digging by having more people placed in such care.  There were 18 or 19 people transitioned from such care but another 20 went in last year.<\/p><p>This is a somewhat small ameliorating measure.  I do not know if the matter can be addressed through regulations either.  There is the question of what can be deducted in terms of financial assessment for those who are in the fair deal nursing home support scheme.  When a person is being assessed for the contribution, there are elements that can be subtracted and where funding can be reserved.  In some cases, all the income may go in, but with some very small points of reservation.  There is an anomaly where a deduction is allowed in order to pay for the education of a child.  There is no deduction allowed for a person's own education or training, however.  That is an anomaly.  There may be older people who want to pursue education and training but for a young person in particular who is in this scheme, there is no allowance to hold back money for his or her education.  This could be done if the person in question had a child but it cannot be done for one's own education.  It is kind of an anomaly.  It exists because it was never envisaged we would have young people in this scheme but we do.  There are over 1,000 young people in it and it is really important their education and payment for their education should be an eligible deduction in the financial assessment and how much income they must contribute towards upkeep in a residential care home.<\/p><p>This is a small matter but we should deal with it while we are addressing the need to decongregate these people.  Looking at the questions in the Wasted Lives report, we should at least ensure that those young people who find themselves wrongfully in this position of long-term residential care in nursing homes should at least be able to take steps towards the next part of their lives.  It would be small gesture of hope and allow people to make plans for their future and not just that of their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#TT00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for proposing the amendment and I understand her concerns about individuals and particularly those who enter care before the age of 65.  The Government has committed to addressing the matter and there is a clear Government commitment to provide a pathway to eliminate the practice of accommodating younger people with serious disabilities in nursing homes.  I met my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to discuss this matter on a couple of occasions since the publication of the report from the Ombudsman.<\/p> <p>The HSE is currently engaging with community healthcare organisation areas to identify people who could take part in a pilot project aimed at facilitating younger people currently in nursing homes and moving them to an alternative housing option in the community.  In tandem with this, the HSE intends to initiate a service reform project aiming to gather baseline information on the population living in nursing homes and carry out full assessments of care within the current placement.<\/p> <p>Projects such as this will provide us with a better picture of the care and support needs of those under 65 living in nursing homes and give a sense of the scale of the task involved in meeting the Government commitment.  The first transitions are expected to take place in the second half of this year and I know everybody will welcome that pilot project.<\/p> <p>In budget 2021 the Government allocated over &euro;2.2 billion for specialist disability services, with &euro;3 million of this funding earmarked to assist in transitioning 18 people currently placed in nursing homes to more appropriate housing options in the community.  We are also providing an additional 40,000 personal assistant hours, with a total target of 1.74 million hours, to support people with disabilities to live self-directed lives.  The Government is committed to implementing the disability capacity review published yesterday in order to meet growing demand for person-centred services over the coming decade.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, oversaw the publication of the review, which was welcomed by all sectors.<\/p> <p>As I stated on Second Stage, it is important to note that my Department is working on developing a statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services that will provide equitable and transparent access to high-quality services based on a person's assessed care needs.  This will also provide transparency around service allocation while ensuring that the scheme operates consistently and fairly across the country.  The system of regulation will ensure public confidence in the services provided, as well as safeguarding service users.<\/p> <p>The provision of home support on a statutory basis is key to giving younger people with complex disabilities an alternative to nursing home care if it is the appropriate option for them and a real opportunity to live full and more independent lives.  I said yesterday that funding has been received for this year and recruitment is under way to put in place 128 assessors of need throughout the country.  The postcode lottery will no longer exist when it comes to being assessed for care in a nursing home, residential long-term facility or care at home with the correct wrap-around supports.  The interRAI single assessment tool will be rolled out and there will be four pilots in place before the end of the year.  We hoped to have that done by the summer but with the cyberattack and Covid-19 - we are all tired of hearing about them - this was very challenging.  Work is ongoing to determine the optimal approach to the development of the statutory scheme within the broader context of the reform of our health and social care service as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.<\/p> <p>The Senator has proposed an amendment committing the Government to producing a report on the question of how education and training are accounted for in the assessment for the fair deal.  I appreciate the concerns raised by the Senator and I will request the Department to consider the matter.  However, it is not necessary to include a legislative requirement to report on this in legislation.  Nevertheless, I give the Senator a guarantee that I will have the Department look into this.

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was able to intervene and provide the necessary supports to enable that young woman to live independently within a supportive community.  That is only one example of several.  Regarding the approach being taken, I hope we never have to hear about the kind of report that was undertaken by the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall.  The Minister of State talked about the figures.  I know some of the people impacted and a real difference is already being made.  It is important that we see such a transformation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#TT00600","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne regarding the commencement of decision-making capacity provisions.

I refer to an assumption of there being a choice of being directed towards education and a future.  We are on a better trajectory and the announcements this week have accelerated this direction of travel in a way that must be applauded.  I commend the Minister of State and what she is doing is appreciated.  Given that the gathering of information is under way, an amendment in this regard could be inserted into the legislation the Minister of State is proposing.  We could also liaise in this respect with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and undertake something in the context of the review of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant system as well.  Given time, we could explore many such aspects.  It is a worthy element of this legislation.  When I read the amendment first, I wondered what its intention was, and then I remembered the context.  It is a reasonable proposal.

We must, by whatever means we achieve it, ensure that younger people and everyone under 65 going into these situations, as described in the report from Peter Tyndall, have educational, training or other similar opportunities in the next year to allow them to prepare at the same time as the State is trying to create a better statutory living situation for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#UU00250","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":298,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is doing much work to try to get this pilot scheme up and running and move the administration from each CHO.

Provision in that regard is made for maintenance expenses in respect of a child under 21 years of age, which is interpreted as including education expenses.

This report may set out legislative measures or procedures which might be implemented to facilitate such persons in their exit from the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, including provisions which may be made in relation to the removal of an interest, or farm, or a relevant business.&rdquo;.  <\/blockquote> <p>We will not have to go over some of this issue again when debating this amendment, because it relates to the subject we just discussed.  I refer to statutory home care, the promise of and need for such home care in different situations and the imperatives under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, to ensure decongregation and deinstitutionalisation.  We must also move towards a statutory model of home care for older people.  Things can change and circumstances can alter, and this is the aspect we must consider.  Rules are in place in this regard, but a strong assumption is also inherent in the way the nursing home support scheme is designed and conceived.  It is evident when people try to find information on changed circumstances and options in that regard.  <\/p><p>It feels very much like a one-way street.  Once people become part of the fair deal nursing home support scheme, it is hard then for them to see what the route of it might be.  People sometimes enter schemes such as this after suffering catastrophic health events, but their circumstances may later change.  One concern in this regard involves people who may have entered the scheme because of having developed a disability or experienced a serious health event.  Normally, those people would have transitioned to community care.  The impact of Covid-19, however, has meant that such care may not have been available and people might have found themselves in residential care instead.  A particular vulnerability has emerged in that regard in the last year.  <\/p><p>People in such situations might well decide later that it is not the model of care they want.  Circumstances may change.  A son or daughter may return from abroad or someone else might become available who could be a carer and that would alter the situation.  Community care and statutory care provision might also become available soon.  When such changes of circumstances occur, then, how do the people concerned get out of this scheme?  How is it possible to exit it?  Where an asset is involved, whether a farm or a business, how do they exist that aspect as well?  What mechanisms are available in that regard? <\/p><p>It happens sometimes that people leave the scheme.  People have managed to do it, although not often.  It is not, however, always a transparent option and it is not always clear that such an option is even on the table.  People might not know such a possibility exists.  If people did, they might derive a great deal of comfort going into this scheme to be aware that in one or two years' time, they could potentially exit the programme if it turned out not to be the best model of care for them in the longer term.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There should be a clear mechanism or way so people know how that would work and what are the expectations.  Again, that is in line with the UN convention on rights for people because it is not just about a choice on care at one point.  It is about the ongoing right to change your mind, to choose again and choose differently.  A person may become particularly vulnerable, have a health event, have a disability, his or her spouse may die, he or she may find themselves at a point of vulnerability and his or her family may be under pressure.  In all of those particular circumstances, as Senator Malcolm Byrne described, nursing home care might seem like the only or the best option but it would be really good if it was clear there was a route out.  An actual specific mechanism in relation to the statutory entitlement to home care will be necessary.  While people have a statutory entitlement and there is a scheme in place in the form of the nursing home support scheme, people do not have the same options on the table where home care is concerned nor do they - this is the last thing I will say on this - have the same options where personal needs assistants are concerned.  These are different from home care support and it is the other direction we must be travelling in, so that people can have personal needs assistants available to them to allow them to live independently and fully.<\/p><p>This was really a report to ask how we build those exit doors, how we build them properly and how we mind the person as well as how we disentangle the asset, in the case of a farm or a business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#UU00700","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":306,"content":"<p>We need to bring this conversation back into context a little.  I understand where the Senator is coming from.  There is absolutely no impediment in legislation or practice to prevent a person who is receiving care under the nursing home support scheme from leaving nursing home care and returning home or to a different setting.<\/p> <p>The nursing home support scheme was put in place in 2009 to ensure there would be no financial barrier to anyone who needed long-term care.  I will give an indication of how seriously the Government takes this.  Last year the cost of the nursing home support scheme was &euro;1.4 billion and approximately 22,500 people availed of the scheme.  The amount of financial aid that came in from costs people paid to support their care was &euro;350 million.  We will be turning our eye towards the budgets very soon.  When I look at my budget, there is &euro;1 billion gone out of it to support the scheme.  It is a very good scheme that has worked very well.<\/p> <p>What we are doing today is correcting an anomaly that came from the 2009 Act whereby farm families and those with small business were not treated as fairly as people who had a principal private residence.  That is the nub of why I stand before Senators; it is to correct that anomaly.  Many organisations like the IFA, Teagasc and Agriland have been raising the matter of the anomaly for many years.  That is the whole purpose of this Bill.  There is also an amendment that was included in the Bill in the D&aacute;il on Wednesday.  It is a really important one and there has not been much conversation around it.  It provides for a situation where a person moves into a nursing home and their house is sold in the meantime.  Previously, if a person stayed in the nursing home beyond three years, the 7.5% he or she had to pay was not capped at three years.  This amendment has been included now and we have been working very closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on it.  It means that when a person is in a nursing home and his or her house is sold, there is no impediment to selling the house.  We know 37% of people who enter nursing homes are there for six or seven months.  Not everybody is in a nursing home for a long time.  There are some people who are but not everybody.  That is important.  We also must put this in the context of the majority of people who go into nursing homes being very sick, very old, having complex care issues and some of them are vulnerable.  They need that support of 24-hour nursing care and because of the nursing home support scheme they are able to get it.  It is not common, but a number of people do regularly leave nursing home care to return home, move into different nursing homes, or into different care settings.<\/p> <p>Over the last 12 months people have actually decided to stay out of residential care because of Covid and because of the visiting restrictions.  They opted to stay at home more and to try to get supports through home care and also privately in order to do that.  That should be acknowledged as well.  In cases where there are financial challenges, it is worth noting access to the scheme is predicated on a care needs assessment which determines whether long-term residential care is necessary for the individual in question based on their clinical needs, community supports and overall level of dependency.  There is a nursing home loan as well that 15% of people in the nursing home support scheme avail of.  Without labouring the point, the scheme is here to support older people who need nursing home care and it means anybody who needs nursing home care is able to afford it.  That is the point that must be made.<\/p> <p>As I said earlier, work is ongoing in the Department to determine the optimal approach to the development of the new statutory home care scheme within the broader context of the ongoing reform of the health and social care system, as envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  As I said, the work encompasses the development of the regulatory framework for the new scheme.  The pilot of a reformed model of service delivery is due to commence in 2021.  Regarding the development of a regulatory framework for home support services, I am pleased to say the Government gave approval in April to draft a general scheme and heads of a Bill to establish a licensing framework for publicly-funded for-profit and not-for-profit home support providers.  I intend to progress this general scheme and heads of Bill as a priority with a view to bringing it through the Houses at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>It is also a Government priority to ensure older people have sufficient housing options in place to meet their needs.  Last Tuesday myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, were in Navan where the Age Friendly Ireland healthy homes approach was launched.  Nine local authorities throughout the country are taking part in a pilot programme where 4,500 people will be assisted to \"rightsize\" their home, that is, not to downsize their home but to rightsize it.  That is the new buzzword.  Supports will be given to a person if he or she needs, for example, advice on how to get a solicitor if he or she needs to sell his or her home, or a person might need advice on property tax.  It covers all these things older people may find hard to navigate if they do not have a family member to support them.  Age Friendly Ireland is doing phenomenal work and I congratulate the people involved on the work they are doing.  We want to support older people to remain living in their own homes or in a home more suited to their needs through the provision of targeted supports.  The most important thing for older people is - one finds this if one talks to older people - the option to live in their own home for as long as possible, with the correct wraparound supports.  That is what we all aspire to.  There is always going to be a small minority of people who need nursing home care.  It is great that we have the facility and that there is a scheme to support financially any person who wants or needs nursing home care.<\/p> <p>I accept and appreciate the issues that have been raised about the up to 1,700 people under the age of 65 years who have been placed in nursing homes, maybe because of disabilities, acquired brain injuries or reasons like that.  I accept the report that was there although I thought the sample was very small, in that it referred to 17 people out of 1,700.  As I said, we will continue to work with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to do the very best we can.  It is important for the House to accept there is a huge amount of work going on.  I do not think it would be appropriate to introduce a legislative amendment to this Bill, which is focused on family farms and businesses, focused on this question.  I therefore cannot accept it.  I understand there are many wider issues which I will be returning often to the House to debate but today this Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill 2021 is purely intended to change an anomaly that was there since 2009.  Many colleagues in both Houses have spoken about this for many years and I welcome all the positive comments on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#VV00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I was happy to support all of the early sections we flew through because I support the Bill.  It is doing something important.  Addressing the question of the three-year cap is really constructive and the amendments on a house being sold are positive also.  There are many very good measures in the Bill.  This is not challenging those measures.  It is addressing a scenario.  I am highlighting an issue.  There is the idea that people stay in their homes for as long as they can.  I worked with older people throughout the country.  I went into residential care homes when we were discussing universal healthcare.  I met older people in residential care homes throughout the country when I worked for Older &amp;amp; Bolder.  There was an idea that nursing homes were not the future of healthcare.  I asked the people in them what they would like.  Something people spoke about was that they want other options.  They did not state that they held on for as long as they could in their homes and now were in nursing homes.  People would like new options even though they are in a residential care home.  This is not to critique the scheme.  I would prefer a statutory home care scheme.  I have been very clear on this and I know the Minister of State knows it.<\/p> <p>A care needs assessment is fine once but perhaps we should be looking at a new care needs assessment two or three years down the line.  When we have statutory home care coming on stream in a proper way, perhaps it will require a new care needs assessment for people in residential care homes who may want to move to it.  It does not have to be a one-way street.  This is an empowering message and something we can do.  It is about looking at the care needs assessment.  People can move away but they are nervous about how they do so.  There is the issue, for example, of how we manage financial vulnerabilities.  I know people will only be charged for the amount of care they have had.  Will that charge be upfront?  Will it be later?  If it is attached to an asset will it wait?  If people move into a statutory home care system that requires them to make a different contribution in a different way how will it transition?  I am signalling these issues with regard to giving people personal choices in an ongoing way and ensuring there is no financial obstacle.  They may be financial logistical obstacles to these transitions and, if so, they need to be addressed.  I will not press the amendment but I signal that we need to tease this out.  The more of this we do in advance, the better the impact we will have on statutory home care and the better life options there will be for those in residential care.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#WW00100","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":308,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State pointed out, what we are dressing here is an anomaly relating to the 2009 scheme.

I have already received representations from people via email and text stating that they are very happy with what is happening here today.  It creates another sound option for them.<\/p> <p>I noticed something this year, and perhaps it was a result of Covid.  In the counties I am involved with most, namely, Galway and Roscommon, two elderly people in difficult situations were heading for nursing home care, which is not what they or their families wanted.

Measures are being taken separately to support people in their own homes.  I thank the Minister of State for being in Navan this week to launch the programme.  It will help 4,500 people to \"right size\" their homes.  The Healthy Age Friendly Homes programme is a unique collaboration between Sl&aacute;intecare and local government.

Recently, I worked on the case of a man leaving an acute hospital whose house was being reconfigured to support him with a downstairs bathroom and bedroom.  He entered a nursing home for eight weeks and was then able to go home, which was great.  This does not happen very often.  I do know that.  I have dealt with many people who go into a specific nursing home because their nursing home of choice may not have capacity at that particular time.  They then moved to that other nursing home after 12 or 18 weeks when a bed becomes available.  I would hate the message to go out that there is an impediment.  There is not.  People can leave.  It does not happen very often because sometimes when people go into a nursing home they discovered they are very happy there and content.  This is great to hear.<\/p> <p>To go back to statutory home care, the successful development of the scheme is a key priority for me.  It is a key priority in the programme for Government.  My predecessor, Jim Daly, did a lot of work on the matter.  When I do my job on a daily basis, it excites me.  The two words I remember every day when I speak about older people are \"voice\" and \"choice\".  Older people have a voice and they also have to have a choice.  This is the most important thing we can do.  This is why the statutory home care scheme will make such a difference.<\/p> <p>Funding was secured in 2021 for the HSE to progress the roll-out of the interRAI, which is the standard assessment for care needs in the community.  When somebody is assessed it is normally by a public health nurse or a GP.  They then support the family with regard to where the person might be placed.  The interRAI for care needs in the community will be standard in every CHO area and every county.  We are recruiting 128 assessors at a cost of &euro;9 million.  That funding was secured in the budget.<\/p> <p>We are also establishing a national office for home support services.  This will be very welcome.  It will be up and running before the end of the year.  I hope it will be in the third quarter of the year.  To have a national office for home support services for anyone with a loved one receiving home supports is very welcome.  I want to mention something I secured in last year's budget which was very important.  A total of &euro;250,000 was ring-fenced for dementia specific care hours.  This was the first time they were ring-fenced.  It is very important to support people with dementia, especially younger people, if they want to stay at home.<\/p> <p>Earlier, I spoke about the four pilot sites.  A total of 230,000 hours of home support will be provided in these four pilot sites.  I also secured funding for setting up an ICT solution for the continued roll-out of interRAI.  A person receiving home care might have to go into an acute hospital or a nursing home.  I want to have a system whereby we can log in to see where that person is.  This came into sharp focus over the past year.  There is no point in people turning up to deliver home care if the person has gone to hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I did a great deal of work on the roll-out of the vaccine to the housebound and the same concerns arose.

The Minister shall, within 12 months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas outlining any trends or impacts identified in relation to the Scheme in terms of its intersection with the implementation of Directive 2010\/41\/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2010.&rdquo;. <\/blockquote> <p>This amendment is related to amendments Nos. 5 and 6 but they are marked as being taken separately so I will address them separately.  This issue came to my attention when I worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland and Older &amp;amp; Bolder.  It is an issue that affects older women in particular but can also affect many others.  The issue relates to economic vulnerability and the financial independence of older women in Ireland.  Many women are not visible in the social protection system.<\/p><p>EU Directive 2010\/41\/EU was transposed by Ireland at the last moment in 2014.  It sets out the provisions whereby social protection PRSI stamps will be paid for a family member working on a farm or in a business.  That has particular relevance for spouses.  Spouses, other family members or those who used to be called relatives assisting can be invisible in their work.  They are not an employee nor are they the owner of a business.  They are not self-employed in the classic sense of owning a business or a farm.  They can fall into a place where they lack financial independence and that can create imbalances of power.  It can create situations for the financial abuse of power and vulnerabilities that I discussed earlier.  <\/p><p>This is not a uniquely Irish phenomenon.  These issues arise everywhere.  Everybody knows of families and businesses that are doing incredible work.  Only one family member may be the owner but other family members carry a considerable burden of work in a family business or farm.  The aim of EU directive was to try to ensure that every member of a family who is working and contributing gets recognition and their own social protection safety net.  Unfortunately, that directive, while it has been transposed, has not been taken up.  We have not seen those safety nets implemented.  Many of those relatives assisting, family members or spouses have not been able to develop their own safety net in terms of social protection.  Many of those people will not qualify for a contributory pension or non-contributory pension or, if they do, they will receive a reduced rate pension.  Many women in Ireland are on reduced-rate pensions and could be begging as little as &euro;100 per week if they are on contributory pensions.  Many do not qualify for the non-contributory pension because their household means test makes them ineligible.  They are, therefore, left vulnerable in terms of their financial independence.<\/p><p>We will not have to talk for as long about amendments Nos. 5 and 6 because they are coming at the same issue in a slightly different way.  The reason this amendment is important is because this Bill includes the business owner and farm owner.  Issues around succession are addressed.  The successor may well be the eldest son or daughter while the spouse, who may well be living in the home, is left in a potentially vulnerable situation.  I want an examination of this new mechanism as it relates to a property that is also a business or farm passing to a successor.  What happens to the siblings?  What happens to the other people who also keep the farm going?  Where are they catered for in this legislation?<\/p><p>There are two levels at which we need to look at how they are supported.  The first relates to the period of time when the farm or business owner is in residential care.  The second relates to the point afterwards.  In a scenario where a farm or business is sold, which I realise is exactly the situation this Bill is trying to avoid, there is an inheritance moment when an asset is dissolved and persons are entitled to certain amounts.  In a scenario where a successor is able to keep the business or farm going, which is obviously good for many reasons, there is not the same kind of inheritance moment.  There is potential difficulty for a spouse or sibling who assists or contributes to that business and who may or may not have PRSI contributions.<\/p><p>I refer to social insurance measures in amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  I am referring to the directive in amendment No. 4.  There is potentially a positive opportunity here.  We could, for example, create a scenario whereby deductions in terms of PRSI become eligible deductions.  It could be that the deductions that are needed for a spouse in terms of their PRSI or the deductions that are needed for a family member who is contributing, those PRSI contributions of the supporting or contributing family member, may be eligible as one of the deductions when financial assessment is conducted.  It may be an opportunity to allow people to build up some social credits while their spouse is in residential care if they have not done that previously.  If they are in a situation where those social insurance payments are already being made, it is, of course, important that they would continue.<\/p><p>Those are the measures I suggest.  All of these issues intersect with health and social protection but the positive measures in this Bill came out of the identification of a social need, a social situation that arises, and I want to make sure that all of the people in that situation are recognised.  A family-named farm might go from one generation of, to pick a name at random, the Kenny family to another.  We must ensure the other people in the mix do not get forgotten and that we do not only look to the owner and the successor.  We must also look to those around them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#XX00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":315,"content":"<p>Many of the matters Senator Higgins raises are very important in the context of the debate.

While we need to have a broader debate about issues such as succession and inheritance on farms, and the huge challenge of the ageing farm profile, this Bill is very specifically dealing with an anomaly in the system.  The Senator's amendments do not assist in any way in that regard. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#XX00500","speaker":"1638","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":317,"content":"<p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Byrne.  Senator Higgins is conflating a successor and an inheritance.  The mechanisms created under the Bill for the appointment of a family successor are strictly in place for the purpose of calculating a person's contribution to long-term care.  They have no other role.  That is their only role.  The successor may not inherit the farm.  The successor can be the wife or the husband but that is not to say that the son, daughter, daughter-in-law, son-in-law or whoever will not inherit the farm.  That is what is being conflated.  In order to apply for this cap to be implemented, on the day this Bill is enacted, a person can appoint a successor.  Doing so will ensure that the farm or small business is kept within family ownership for the next six years.  The HSE will do one check over that time and this rule will mean that the farm or business will be kept within the family.  The successor may not inherit and has no legal right to inherit.  He or she is just a successor so that a person who enters long-term care can avail of the cap after three years and does not have to pay 7.5% on the value of his or her house, properties, outbuildings, pub, small restaurant or whatever business he or she has.  We need to be clear on that.  The whole purpose of the successor is to ensure that the farm or small business is kept within the family.  That is why we did not include land that was leased out, as that would go against the thrust of what we were trying to achieve.<\/p> <p>I understand the concerns relating to the status of spouses on farms where succession arrangements are made, with regard to social insurance.  I appreciate that concern and I will raise it with my colleagues in the Departments of Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  However, it is important that we accept and appreciate that issues of social insurance contributions and so on do not form part of this Bill.  They are very important issues and all we want to do is support people in order that they will have the financial means to live at home or to enter a nursing home.  I reiterate that if someone's father, mother, aunt or uncle has been in a nursing home for two years, from the day a successor is appointed those two years served will be included and they will only have to spend another year in the nursing home for the cap of three years to apply.  If a person has already spent four years in the nursing home, from the day a successor is appointed and agreed, within the terms and conditions of the Bill, that cap will apply immediately.  We tried to make this as workable and as family friendly as possible.<\/p> <p>The issue was raised with us of sons or daughters who had gone away to Australia, America or Canada but who had always been part of the farm family.  Initially they would have had to prove that the farm had been in family ownership for three of the previous five years but if they have been gone for three years, through no fault of their own for work or whatever, they can still become the successor.  As I said, they just have to prove that they have a link with the farm and that they will farm it for a reasonable amount of time.  They do not have to provide any financial statements or anything to prove that they are getting an income from the farm because we all know how it goes with small farms and small businesses.  I was part of a small business for 17 years.  We had the corner shop where I lived and I ran it with my father and then with my sister when he passed away.  We all know that families help out in small businesses, whether that is a pub or a farm.  One of my staff members went home today and she said she would not be seen for the weekend because they are cutting silage for the entire weekend.  It is as simple as that.  It is all hands on deck.<\/p> <p>I do not think this issue is sufficiently connected to the scope of these amendments and the nursing homes support scheme in general to merit the introduction of this amendment.  On that basis I cannot accept it but I have given a commitment that we will raise the issue and I understand where the Senator is coming from.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#YY00200","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I will push back a little bit on this.  I am constructive and reasonable.  Let us be clear: nothing I am putting in this amendment counteracts what the Minister of State is doing or undermines it.  We should remember that legislation is legislation.  Legislation does not just belong to the Government.  It is not just what the Government would like to be discussed.  Legislation is what others see as relevant to it and my amendments have been deemed as relevant.  I have suffered many times at the other end of the scale when they were not considered relevant but they are, in fact, relevant.  They may not relate to the areas in which people are particularly interested or which are their main focus but they are what I am interested in and they are relevant to this Bill.  I will point out exactly how.<\/p> <p>This is the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill.  It is about the nursing homes support scheme.  The Long Title refers to the provisions \"... for the financial assessment of persons applying for financial support to be made available to them...\" and those \"... who have, or had, an interest in a farm or relevant business...\" and provide for related matters and the conditions attached.  Some of the areas I have highlighted tie directly back into that.  This Bill provides that businesses and farms will stay in the family and will not have to be sold, and I have said that is a good thing.  It will make it easier for a business to stay in the family.  However, when a business stays in the family there is not a moment of dissolution of an asset, where an inheritance event takes place and certain shares might go.  Instead, there is a continuum.  The asset is not dissolved and there is continuity of income from an ongoing business or farm.  Obviously it is better if we keep farms and businesses going and in the same family but it is important that we address the fact of how income is generated and what will happen in the future.  That is relevant here.<\/p> <p>It is also a strong principle of feminist economics that we support financial independence.  I make no apologies for saying that.  In fact, it is a principle that is meant to be supported in our social protection system.  We should be trying at all points to ensure the financial independence of all family members.  That is a principle at European level and that is why that EU directive exists specifically in relation to farms and those who work on farms.  I did not dream this topic up.  It was an imperative from Europe because Ireland and many other countries are not very good at recognising the contribution of spouses - women in many cases, but it may be any other spouse on a farm - and ensuring they are visible within our social protection systems.  I identified a positive opportunity here to increase that visibility in how financial assessments are done and to recognise the people who do not own the business.  They may have to pay PRSI but they do not own the business and are not employees so PRSI is not being paid on their behalf.  That is a particular circumstance that arises with farms and family businesses.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=16\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->How will that PRSI be paid?  It there a guarantee it will continue to be paid during those periods?  Those are relevant questions to consider in the financial assessment and the capping of the income from the farming business to cover the cost of long-term residential care.  Those are relevant factors.  We discussed the cost of children's education being a relevant factor that might be excluded.  PRSI in respect of a contributing spouse is also something that should be included in those areas of deductions set out in the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, which this Bill amends.  Those are relevant issues.  Many women who are qualified adults or adult dependants, which was the term used in the past, do not have financial independence and may not feature in our PRSI records even though they have worked all their lives.  I make no apology for taking any opportunity to strengthen their position but that is not to oppose the purposes of the Bill, which I support.  I seek to address this important issue and suggest we examine this.  When we change how things are done and create benefits we may also create vulnerabilities.  It is appropriate to consider what steps we might take to monitor or ameliorate those vulnerabilities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#YY00300","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":320,"content":"<p>Legislation does not belong only to the Government.

I took on board three amendments.  The first of those proposed that when the Bill is signed into law, it will be enacted within 90 days.  The second amendment proposed that when a person who might be going into a nursing home would have to go for an interview with the HSE, he or she would be allowed to bring another person with him or her to support that person.  I thought that was an important provision.  It was one I was minded to include myself.  The third amendment related to the notification of a successor, for example, in the event of an awful tragic accident or of somebody passing away.  We are all conscious that farm fatalities happen and people can pass away.  The Bill provided the HSE would have to be informed of the change to the scheme within ten working days.  On foot of working with the Opposition, I changed that period to 20 working days, which is a month.  Once the HSE is informed there is a change to the successor, one still has six months to make any changes.  I was conscious of such events, hopefully that will not happen but there is always an opportunity it could happen.

I am engaging in the same area, specifically on pay related social contributions made for spouses on farms.  Perhaps that is the issue, namely, whether there is a category and an allowance for PRSI contributions to be deducted.  Perhaps it simply needs to be extended to ensure the interpretation of it will extend to relevant family members in terms of spouses or family members who qualify under that EU directive.  There might be scope to provide that.  Currently, the legislation is very much framed as if those individuals are responsible for making those contributions when, effectively, the making of those contributions has to come from the income of the farming business.  Perhaps it is a matter of teasing out how that is interpreted.  There may be scope to address the problem in that regard.<\/p><p>With respect to social protection entitlements of family members of the person concerned, a related issue in terms of qualified adults may be tackled in that respect.  Sometimes they are independent payments and sometimes they are attached payments.  I have not tabled these amendments simply to have a conversation on this issue.  I tabled them because I worked with older people, older women in particular, for three or four years and I saw how they were impacted by inequalities in our pensions system.  I subsequently worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland and saw how that gets deeply embedded.  This is a chance to address that.  When we talk about the family as a unit, family members are not all of the same mind working seamlessly together.  As I said, much of our literature would not be what it is if that were the case.  There are power dynamics and imbalances within families.  There is an entire field of sociology related to household bargaining and how that works.  As legislators, we should try to ensure the best possible grounds in that respect.  That is why we should try to make something that is good for the family and the farm as good as possible for all the members of the family, not only the successor and inheritor but potentially the others who will come after them.  That is where I am coming from in tabling these amendments.  It is an important discussion and it also will be important to monitor the operation of this new measure.  I hope as this unfolds, as the new mechanism comes into place and more of those with family farms and businesses avail of the nursing homes support scheme because of the measures that made it much more workable, possible and effective, that these issues will be monitored to take account of any patterns that emerge and that suitable measures will be taken, be it through regulations, further amendment of this Bill, the review or separate legislation, to address any further concerns that arise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#ZZ00800","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":327,"content":"<p>When considering how couples are treated under this Bill, fairness has always been the guiding principle.  This is particularly relevant when considering the appointment of a family successor in respect of both members of a couple regarding the same productive asset in cases where both members of the couple are living and in cases where one member of the couple is deceased.  I will address the issue of couples.  When the Bill went through Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I flagged my intention to bring forward a number of Report Stage amendments to provide for and protect the second partner in a couple.  It is important to point out that when a couple are assessed and whether that couple are in a nursing home - there are occasions when a couple can be in a nursing home at the same time although they may not be in the same nursing home but it can happen -  normally the assessment is 80% of one's income and 7.5% of the value of one's home, farm or business for three years, which, thankfully, is what will be provided for when this Bill is enacted.  In the case of a couple it is 40% of their income and 3.75% of the value of their asset.  There are also a number of questions pertaining to succession and inheritance arrangements and ownership models of assets that will need to be completed before the Bill is operationalised.  The laws of succession are complex and the Bill will need to reflect the various scenarios that can occur when one member of a couple dies.<\/p> <p>In the case of a surviving spouse, this person has clear rights under the Succession Act and the appointment of a family successor under this Bill cannot in any way usurp these rights.  The successor is appointed for the purpose of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill is there for one reason only, to ensure the farm stays in family ownership.  The surviving spouse has clear rights under the Succession Act and there is no way a family successor can usurp that.  Although the family successor is expected to actively work the farming business, it is not necessary under this Bill that the family successor ultimately inherits or has any rights at all to the farm or the business.  That needs to be made very clear.

I thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate and for their time, yesterday and today.  Many of them have waited until the end of the debate even though it is the final sitting day before recess.  I watched all my colleagues go home yesterday at 3.30 p.m. but I was delighted that the Seanad could sit late on a Friday evening, so I thank Senators very much for that.<\/p> <p>It has taken some time to get to this point.  Since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for older people and mental health, I have pursued the scheme's implementation as an absolute priority.  Family farms and small businesses perform a vital role in providing employment and enhancing the future development of rural Ireland.  For communities and families, they are not only an essential means of making a living but may also represent priceless assets, a link passed between generations and a connection to the land itself.  I acknowledge my predecessor, the then Minister of State, Jim Daly, who got the ball rolling.  It would be remiss of me not to mention him.  The legislation was in progress when I took up the role and I recall discussing the Bill and statutory home care with him, among other matters.<\/p> <p>It is essential that farms' value be protected in case people must enter long-term care in order that they remain viable and sustainable for families long into the future.  The legislation will ensure that the fair deal scheme will operate more fairly for these families.  It will mean farm families and business owners will not be afraid to go into long-term care because of what it might mean for their plans to pass on property.  I am sure it will be welcomed throughout rural Ireland.  I am delighted to have brought the legislation through the Houses and I extend my thanks to all those who have played a role in getting us here - Senators, Deputies and my colleagues in the Government - for providing the drive and challenge to move the agenda forward.<\/p> <p>I thank the Attorney General, who has been very supportive to me.  We have had many conversations because although the Bill sounds simple, it is highly complex.  I thank the stakeholders representing older people, farmers and business owners for their input into the legislation.  I thank also the officials in the Department of Health, the HSE and other State agencies for working tirelessly to develop the complex legal mechanisms behind the reform.  I thank Ms Fiona Larthwell and Mr. Neil Kavanagh for their tireless work and for the hours and hours that have gone into the Bill, as well as their interaction with the Attorney General and officials.  Lastly, I acknowledge the farm-owning and business-owning families of Ireland, in whose name this has been done. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#AAA01800","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I thank and congratulate the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2021071600002#AAA01900","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1626424200,"counter":347,"content":"<p>The Minister of State has thanked and congratulated everybody for their role in bringing forward the Bill and they all deserve our thanks, but it is the Minister of State who has championed the Bill.

She had a meeting with Alice Doyle from Wexford and told her that the Government was going to get this completed.<\/p> <p>This will be transformative.  We often talk in the House about the impact that legislation has, but for farm families and business-owning families, this will be truly transformative.  In the course of a year, through the work she has done regarding mental health and older people, the Minister of State has shown her mettle but also her empathy.   She noted that this is complex legislation.  The people she has had in mind throughout the process are those farm families and individuals who are affected and the Bill will make a big difference.  To her, her officials and all who have been involved, I say \"Well done\".
