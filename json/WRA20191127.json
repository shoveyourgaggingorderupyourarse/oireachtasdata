While agriculture contributes to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, the sector also has the means to be part of the alleviation process and has a key role to play in transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector is 'an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production'. <\/p>  <p>  While carbon neutrality is yet to be fully defined, our policy approach is based on three principles: <\/p>  <p>  - Reducing agriculture emissions; <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing carbon sequestration; and <\/p>  <p>  - The displacement and substitution of fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. <\/p>  <p>  Indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and will become even more important in the context of reducing our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030 and decarbonising our energy systems by 2050. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a 16% target for renewable energy by 2020 and the production of indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping us meet this renewable energy target and my Department has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Through the forestry programme, my Department is committed to increasing the supply of biomass from Ireland&rsquo;s forests.  In 2018, 40% of the wood fibre used in Ireland was used for energy generation, mainly within the forest products sector, up from 34% a couple of years ago. This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.<\/p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018 total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood.<\/p>  <p>  The Department did previously operate a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production. However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. On-going support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific &ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Promotion","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[49104\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to support local food production with particular reference to small farms and facilitating the production of vegetables.","asker":"1294","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>My Department supports vegetable producers by means of grant aid provided through the Scheme of Investment Aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector.

This support assists with the veterinary costs involved in preparing a retired greyhound for rehoming, neutering\/spaying, a rabies shot and other vaccinations and inoculations.<\/p>  <p>  In August 2019, Bord na gCon announced the establishment of a separate Care Fund dedicated to funding a variety of initiatives for the care and welfare of the greyhound, including various rehoming initiatives in conjunction with the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust.<\/p>  <p>  It is estimated that a sum of &euro;740,000 will be generated for the Care Fund in 2020, with a percentage of admission and restaurant entries, Tote income and existing sponsorship money accruing the total sum.  This combined with the funding generated in the latter part of 2019 will ensure a dedicated fund in excess of &euro;1 million for care and welfare initiatives throughout next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare Bodies","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA03800"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":56,"qnumall":"[48913\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700046#WRA03900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he will increase funding to an organisation (details supplied) to enable it to expand its mobile veterinary clinic services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1361","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":41,"content":"<p>Since 1995, my Department has provided ex-gratia funding to animal charities to assist in their work in animal care and welfare.

My Department and I have been creating and supporting policies to support inshore fishers all around the coast including islands.  The majority of the fishing vessels based on islands are smaller vessels. Inshore fishing boats currently make up more than 80% of the fishing fleet and support an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 jobs. This economic activity is vitally important to the coastal communities around Ireland, including the island communities from which these boats operate. The national and regional forums are supporting initiatives that seek to protect the collective interests of the inshore sector in Ireland including on our islands. The NIFF has been effective in its participation on the Quota Management Advisory Committee, advocating on behalf of all small-scale fishers to influence how Ireland's uptake of quota is achieved.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to quotas for fish stocks, these are available to small scale coastal fishermen who are licensed to fish for quota stocks including whitefish and pelagic stocks. Catch limits are set for whitefish stocks primarily based on the length of a fishing vessel. On this basis, all vessels under 55 feet in length receive the same catch limit.  The important pelagic stocks of mackerel and herring already have allocations made available that supports inshore vessels. <\/p>  <p>  In Ireland, quota is a public resource and this policy ensures that quotas do not become a saleable commodity that is bought up by large companies to the detriment of small scales operators, as has happened in other Member States.  The result of this long-standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels which have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities.  This in turn delivers economic activity, including vital employment, in these communities where there are limited alternative economic activities. <\/p>  <p>  On 21 December 2018, following a full public consultation process, I announced that vessels over 18m length overall will be excluded from trawling in inshore waters inside the six nautical mile zone and the baselines from 1 January 2020, with a phased reduction of the sprat fishery until 2022. I am mindful of the opportunity these measures will provide for further sustainable development of the small scale inshore sector to fish within this area and with lower environmental impacts.  <\/p>  <p>  The proportion of landings being foregone by larger vessels will provide opportunities to smaller inshore and island fishermen which would represent a potential increase of 62% in the value of their landings.  Additionally, the increase in availability of sprat and herring (when stocks recover) to smaller vessels will represent a diversification opportunity as these species are found in bays and coastal areas during the winter. <\/p>  <p>   I am very conscious of the exclusive reliance of small scale and island fishermen on inshore waters and the benefits this change will bring for those fishermen.

One of their ten recommendations was the development of industrial hemp processing facilities in an effort to provide viable, sustainable and alternative land use for farmers as well as employment in rural Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, current legislation does not allow for the growing of hemp unless a specific licence has been granted by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) which operates under the auspices of the Department of Health.  In addition, the cultivation of hemp (Cannabis genus) is restricted to varieties having less than 0.2% content of the narcotic compound Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).

While agriculture contributes to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, the sector also has the means to be part of the alleviation process and has a key role to play in transitioning to a competitive, low carbon, climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland's long-term policy vision for the agriculture and land use sector is 'an approach to carbon neutrality which does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production'. <\/p>  <p>  While carbon neutrality is yet to be fully defined, our policy approach is based on three principles: <\/p>  <p>  - Reducing agriculture emissions; <\/p>  <p>  - Increasing carbon sequestration; and <\/p>  <p>  - The displacement and substitution of fossil fuel and energy intensive materials. <\/p>  <p>  Indigenous renewable energy plays a vital role in our domestic fuel mix and will become even more important in the context of reducing our reliance on imported fuels and in meeting our challenging renewable energy targets for 2020 and 2030 and decarbonising our energy systems by 2050.   <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has a 16% target for renewable energy by 2020 and the production of indigenous biomass has a crucial role to play in helping us meet this renewable energy target and my Department has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  Through the forestry programme, my Department is committed to increasing the supply of biomass from Ireland&rsquo;s forests.  In 2018, 40% of the wood fibre used in Ireland was used for energy generation, mainly within the forest products sector, up from 34% a couple of years ago. This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.<\/p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018 total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood.<\/p>  <p>  The Department did previously operate a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production. However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. On-going support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a specific &ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed.   <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company operating under the Turf Development Acts, 1946 to 1998, and, as such, operational matters are the responsibility of the Board and management of the Company.

The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess a drug's clinical and cost effectiveness as a health intervention.<\/p>  <p>  As a country, we invest heavily in medicines, to the tune of almost &euro;2 billion annually. In 2019 to date, the HSE has approved 36 new drugs and newly licensed indications for existing drugs for reimbursement in the public healthcare system. The approvals to date represent an additional investment by the HSE over five years of approximately &euro;220m in providing access to new and innovative treatment for Irish patients. It is expected that over 3,000 patients will benefit from access to these new medicines over the next 5 years.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the significant progress on drug costs achieved from price reductions under the pricing framework agreed with industry and commercial negotiations conducted by the HSE, the Health Service is still facing very significant challenges in relation to the affordability of medicines.\u00a0 The industry continues to develop very expensive products, particularly in the high-tech medicines area and the costs involved are a challenge for health systems even in countries with much greater resources than Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has received 2 applications for pricing and reimbursement of ocrelizumab (Ocrevus).\u00a0 Application 1 is for use of Ocrelizumab for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Following a number of rounds of commercial negotiations, an agreement was reached in relation to the commercial terms which will apply to this indication.

On 4 October 2018 the NCPE completed its assessment for this indication. They did not recommend that ocrelizumab be reimbursed for this indication.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE and the manufacturer have had a number of rounds of commercial negotiations in relation to this indication.

This represents over 1.5 million cubic metres of wood fibre and includes, roundwood, sawmill and residues such as bark, sawdust and woodchip. The new Support Scheme for Renewable Heat is creating additional demand for biomass particular since the second phase was launched during the summer which will provide operational support for biomass boilers.<\/p>  <p>  According to the All Ireland Roundwood Forecast 2016 &ndash; 2035, output from Irish forests is expected to double over the coming decades to around 8 million cubic metres. Most of this increased production will come from private forest owners. In fact, during 2018, total timber production from private forest owners exceeded 1 million cubic metres for the first time. In order to address the barriers that exist in mobilising this resource, my Department supports a number of targeted measures including the construction of forest roads to provide access to the timber, knowledge transfer groups to assist forest owners in managing their forests and grants for second thinning of broadleaves which provides an important source of local firewood. <\/p>  <p>  The Department previously\u00a0operated a bioenergy scheme to facilitate the establishment of energy crops (including willow and miscanthus) for use in renewable energy production.\u00a0\u00a0However, due to a low uptake, the scheme was suspended from 2016 and there are currently no plans to re-introduce support. Ongoing support for the production of biomass will continue to be provided under the Forestry Programme 2014-2020 which funds private afforestation and includes a\u00a0specific \u00a0&ldquo;forestry for fibre&rdquo; scheme.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to consider all opportunities for further developments in the area of biomass in the context of the next Forestry Programme and the next CAP Strategic programme, which is currently being developed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700051#WRF06700","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Data","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700051#WRF06800"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[42320\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700051#WRF06900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of native woodland trees to be planted on former bogland in each of the years 2019 to 2022, by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":401,"qnumday":179,"qnumall":"[42321\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700051#WRF07000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of native woodland trees to be planted outside of former bogland in each of the years 2019 to 2022, by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":402,"qnumday":180,"qnumall":"[42319\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700051#WRF07100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of native woodland trees planted in each of the years 2007 to 2018, inclusive, by county in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":403,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178 to 180, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Under the current Forestry Programme 2014 -2020, the planting of native woodlands is supported through a grant of &euro;6,200 per hectare and 15 year premiums of &euro;680 per hectare.

My Department is fully committed to mobilising the LULUCF credits as outlined in the &lsquo;All of Government action plan for climate change&rsquo;. To achieve these challenging targets, it will require immediate action through early adoption and high levels of take-up of the identified actions across our 139,000 plus family farms.<\/p>  <p>  These credits provide a means to assist the agricultural sector contributing to Irelands ambition on climate action.<\/p>  <p>  Forestry provides resources for the bioenergy supply chain, the wider bio-economy and timber products that can act as a less carbon-intensive substitute of other materials in construction and other related sectors as well as through the displacement of fossil fuels.

Regulation (EC) No. 178 of 2002 sets out the general principles and requirements of EU food law and stipulates that food business operators must, at all stages of production, processing and distribution within their business, ensure food law requirements are satisfied. In regard to traceability, the regulations require that food business operators have what is\u00a0referred to as the &lsquo;one step forward, one step backward&rsquo; traceability system. There are additional requirements for certain fishery and aquaculture products under the Control Regulation (Regulation 1224\/2009 and Implementing Regulation 404\/2011) from first sale to subsequent stages of production, processing and distribution up to retail.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a permanent veterinary presence at all of its approved slaughter plants. Controls at plants only engaged in secondary processing are carried out at a frequency based on an annual risk assessment. An annual audit of imported products is carried out in each Department-approved plant, including checks on physical identity, labelling and documentary checks.<\/p>  <p>  Extra veterinary checks are carried out on selected consignments of foods imported into DAFM-approved establishments from other EU Member States or from Third Countries outside the EU.\u00a0These checks include, physical checks of product condition, checks of accompanying documentation and checks of labelling and health markings.<\/p>  <p>  The import of products of animal origin from third countries is governed by a comprehensive and robust legislative framework laid down at EU level, controlled by Member States in the first instance, and audited by the European Commission&rsquo;s Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (formally the FVO), to ensure compliance with all of the relevant food safety standards. The legislation imposes health and supervisory requirements designed to ensure that imported products meet standards equivalent to those required for production and trade between Member States. Border Inspection Posts are operated by my Department. Import control procedures on products of animal and fish origin are highly prescriptive and strictly audited by the Commission to ensure compliance. Inspection reports are published on the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the controls and checks\u00a0in place and enforced by my Department\u00a0ensure that Irish consumers are protected and correctly informed when they purchase and consume food products. Checks for products of animal origin numbered 2,858 in 2018 and\u00a02,898 to date in 2019. All\u00a0consignments are documentary and identity checked and physical checks, including sampling of products, are carried out according to European regulations.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has service contracts in place with the official agencies performing official controls, to verify compliance with the extensive requirements of food labelling legislation, in these establishments.\u00a0 The FSAI reports in detail on the number of inspections and checks carried out, and non-compliance findings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700052#WRG05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fishing Industry","counter":456,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700052#WRG05500"},{"type":"question","counter":457,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[49446\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700052#WRG05600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the extent to which fishing remains a viable option for fishing dependent families nationally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":458,"content":"<p>The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term conservation and sustainability of fish stocks around our shores and is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters.

In the year 2000, nearly 11,000 herds endured a bTB restriction while 40,000 reactors were identified. Now, Ireland has approximately 3,800 herds experiencing bTB outbreaks each year, with around 17,000 cattle declared reactors annually. <\/p>  <p>  This period of rapid improvement in bTB incidence coincided with the implementation of a modern IT disease-management system and the implementation of a wildlife programme. While bTB levels overall are historically lower than ever, since 2016 there has been\u00a0a gradual increase\u00a0in disease trends. This\u00a0 highlight the need for the Programme to continuously adapt as factors influencing disease transmission change. <\/p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s TB eradication\u00a0Programme aims to drive bovine TB\u00a0disease levels down towards the target of eradication by 2030. It is focussed on measures which will further reduce transmission of bTB. In the coming weeks, I will be launching\u00a0a renewed\u00a0strategy\u00a0underpinned by the principle of supporting and empowering farmers to reduce the bTB risk to their cattle by making informed choices to protect their herd and their neighbour&rsquo;s herds. Equally, there is a particular focus on assisting herdowners whose herds are affected with bTB and to clear their herds of infection. <\/p>  <p>  Stakeholders have recognised that further preventative measures are required if the ambition of eradication by 2030 is to be achieved. Steadily reducing the risk of disease transmission is the best way in which support can be provided to all Irish farmers &ndash; those whose herds are impacted by bTB and those whose herds are clear and who wish to remain free of the disease. The recommendations made by the bTB Stakeholders Forum have informed the development of this strategy, and stakeholder involvement and leadership will continue to be critical to successfully eradicating bTB.<\/p>  <p>  The risks associated with each potential transmission channel will be reduced through a series of coordinated measures, which will be applied in addition to the existing programme and in full compliance with the EU requirements for bTB eradication. <\/p>  <p>  While the\u00a0strategy is still be being finalised, some of it central themes will be:<\/p>  <p>  1.

This includes policy in relation to energy security, which is fully aligned with EU law and EU policy objectives. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) has statutory functions relating to energy security, for both gas and electricity, and is independent in the exercise of its functions. These include functions in the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999, as amended, to promote the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. CRU also is required by S.I. 60\/2005 to monitor, and take such measures as it considers necessary to protect, the security of supply of electricity. In relation to gas, the CRU also has a statutory function to secure the continuity, security and quality of supplies of natural gas. The CRU is also the designated competent authority for Ireland, for EU Regulation 2017\/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of supply of gas. <\/p>  <p>  The National Oil Reserves Agency has statutory responsibility in relation to the storage of oil stocks for use in an emergency, at a level sufficient to comply with the State&rsquo;s stockholding obligations. <\/p>  <p>  The transmission system operators for gas and electricity, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid, have legal responsibilities in relation to gas and electricity security. The electricity transmission system operators are responsible for, inter alia, ensuring the long-term ability of the system to meet reasonable demands for the transmission of electricity, and contributing to security of supply through adequate transmission capacity and system reliability. The gas transmission system operators are required, inter alia, to operate, maintain and develop under economic conditions secure, reliable and efficient transmission facilities to secure an open market, with due regard to the environment.<\/p>  <p>  My Department regularly engages with State Agencies and other stakeholders, including Gas Networks Ireland and the ESB, as part of the normal process of feeding into policy development and formulation. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to energy sustainability and security, I am initiating a major review into Ireland's energy sustainability and security which will:<\/p>  <p>  -  Consider the optimal actions that need to be taken, in reaching 70% renewable electricity, to ensure Ireland's electricity system is backed up in a secure, safe and sustainable way. <\/p>  <p>  -  Assess the role of gas during the transition, as the lowest CO2 emitting fossil fuel, and consider how and from where it is sourced. <\/p>  <p>  -  Review the role that other technologies can play in the transition, including battery storage, pumped storage, the role of interconnection (both gas and electricity) and the possibilities for hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). <\/p>  <p>  -  Consider what the roadmap for renewable electricity looks like in the period from 2030 to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050<\/p>  <p>  The review that I have initiated into Ireland's energy security and sustainability will be carried out by an independent body following a public procurement exercise.

These relate to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the associated Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. The LULUCF Regulation includes an alignment of land use categories with those reported to the UNFCCC and brings the LULUCF sector into the European Union&rsquo;s 2030 climate policy framework more directly by including a link between the Effort Sharing Regulation (Regulation 2018\/842) and land use accounting. This Regulation forms parts of the implementation of the European Union&rsquo;s commitments under the Paris Agreement.<\/p><p>Due to certain specificities and the complex nature of this sector, the LULUCF sector is treated differently to other sectors under the European Union&rsquo;s climate framework policy. The LULUCF Regulation requires Member States to ensure that accounted emissions from land use are entirely compensated by equivalent accounted removals from the atmosphere through action in the sector, i.e. to ensure that there are no net accounted emissions from those sectors. This obligation covers all managed land use categories in the territory of Ireland and requires the State to account for emissions and removals from both State-owned land and privately-owned land, including forests. Ireland and other EU Member States may employ a capped amount of total accounted removals, in excess of the no net emissions obligation, to meet targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. It is also possible for Member States to use annual emissions allocations under the Effort Sharing Regulation to meet their obligations under the LULUCF Regulation. <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s National Inventory Report, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency, details the methodologies followed in developing estimates of emission and removals for LULUCF.

There is no inherent private property right to greenhouse gas emissions or removals by forests or other land uses, whether on lands held by the State or privately owned. The State supports the long-term greenhouse gas store in the forest estate through regulation and financial incentives for forest planting and sustainable management, such as the afforestation grant and premium scheme.

To this end, I visited Sligo earlier this year with a multi-disciplinary team from my Department to meet with\u00a0a similar delegation from Sligo. The Council has ambitious plans itself and my Department is working with the Council to support their achievement. In this regard, as a follow up to the Sligo meeting, we have put Sligo forward to participate in the Joint Assistance to Support Regions\u00a0programme, under the auspices of the\u00a0European Investment Bank, which will, inter alia, help maximise the potential of the &euro;8.5m allocated to Sligo by my Department under the Urban Regeneration Development Fund.<\/p>  <p>  As regards funding, the elected members have direct responsibility for adopting the annual budget, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority. It is a matter for Sligo County Council to manage its resources and determine its own spending priorities having regard to needs and available resources. While it is a matter for individual local authorities to manage their own day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner,\u00a0my Department works closely with Sligo County Council in relation to both its financial position and overall staffing requirements.<\/p>  <p>  Sligo County Council has a financial plan in place and is working towards financial sustainability. In this context, my Department has supported the Council with an additional annual allocation from the Local Government Fund for the years 2014 to 2019 on the basis that agreed targets in the Plan are met. In March 2014, following a meeting with my Department wherein a draft financial plan was submitted, it was decided to provide Sligo County Council with &euro;250,000. However, in the absence of the detailed plan being finally agreed before the end of 2014 it was not possible to make a further payment to Sligo at that time. Subsequently, the financial plan for the years 2015 - 2019 was agreed in late 2015. Sligo County Council advised my Department in early 2017 that the &ldquo;revenue cumulative surplus&rdquo; as profiled in the plan for delivery in the years 2017 onwards was no longer achievable. As a result, the plan was extended, including revised targets, to 2027. <\/p>  <p>  An additional amount of &euro;1 million had been paid for 2015, 2016 and 2017 but the payment for 2018, was\u00a0reduced to &euro;200k to reflect the reduced surplus that could be achieved in 2017 based on the information available at the time. As the actual 2017 surplus was ultimately higher than was anticipated by Sligo County Council, a higher payment of &euro;700,000 was made by my Department.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each Chief Executive is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. \u00a0It is therefore, a matter for each individual Chief Executive to apply for sanction from my Department and, once approved, to recruit and assign staff to specific divisions within their organisation. \u00a0Staffing sanction requests are examined on a case by case basis having due regard to the continued delivery of key services in the context of staffing and budgetary constraints. My Department is working with Sligo County Council on the staffing requests mentioned in the question.<\/p>  <p>  Significant additional resources were made available to Sligo County Council in the context of the financial plan, far in excess of additional support to any other local authority. Any further funding\u00a0for Sligo County Council, will be considered within the overall framework of the Financial Plan. In this regard, Sligo County Council&rsquo;s audited Annual Financial Statement for 2018 is currently under review in order to determine the amount of the next payment. The allocation that will be due when that review is complete will be for use at Sligo County Council's discretion and can be directed towards the costs of establishing a Land Asset Team, if that is the preferred approach.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700056#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1265"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700056#WRL00725"},{"type":"question","counter":694,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[49234\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019112700056#WRL00750","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of rental properties and the number of landlords in the private rental sector in each of the years 2012 to 2018 and to date in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":695,"content":"<p>My Department does not hold or collate the information referred to in the Question.<\/p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) which was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts\u00a0 2004-2019, operates a national tenancy registration system.<\/p>  <p>  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il requested that arrangements be put in place to facilitate the provision of information by State Bodies to members of the Oireachtas.\u00a0 Following the issue of Circular LG (P)05\/16 on 20 September 2016 from my Department, the RTB set up a dedicated email address for this purpose.

The Regulation implements the agreement between EU leaders in October 2014 that all sectors should contribute to the EU's 2030 emission reduction target, including the land use sector. It is also in line with the Paris Agreement, which points to the critical role of the land use sector in reaching our long-term climate mitigation objectives.<\/p>  <p>  The primary legislation underpinning the protection and conservation of nature in Ireland are the Wildlife Acts 1976 to 2018, the implementation of which falls under the remit of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The Wildlife Acts afford protection to a range of habitats and species and provide for regulation and control of activities that impinge on biodiversity. The basic designation for wildlife is the Natural Heritage Area (NHA), an area considered important for the habitats present or which holds species of plants and animals whose habitat needs protection. <\/p>  <p>  73 blanket bogs, covering 37,000ha, are designated as NHAs.<\/p>  <p>  The legislative framework in place to protect our natural habitats is further strengthened by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 SI No 477\/2011, which also falls under the remit of my Department. These Regulations transpose the EU Birds Directive and the EU Habitats Directive into national law, and provide for protection of certain habitats and species across the European Union, giving a framework for specific measures to be taken to target areas of concern in each Member State. The main instruments provided for are the designation of Special Protection Areas (SPA), aimed at the protection of threatened species of birds, and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC), aimed at protecting other animal species and habitats. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has identified 50 areas as Special Areas of Conservation for the protection of blanket bog.
