While the cause of this increase is not known, the Department is generally in favour of the limited use of Section 12 to detain people because being taken into Garda custody can have a traumatising effect on people.\u00a0The HSE has requested clarity from the Commission on the number of applications made by Garda&iacute;, particularly a breakdown between the use of Section 9 and Section 12.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will understand,\u00a0the proportion of applications for involuntary detention reflects the unfortunate reality that Garda&iacute; often encounter persons with severe mental health issues and will be called upon by members of the public or indeed family members where a person is experiencing high levels of distress.\u00a0 Very often,\u00a0members of\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are the first available frontline service to whom people will turn in such situations.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently finalising a draft general scheme to significantly amend the Mental Health Act 2001, including proposed changes to the admission process and an updated criteria for detention.\u00a0 Work on updating the Mental Health Act has been in development for the last number of years. The draft general scheme is generally in line with the recommendations of a 2015 Expert Group review of the Act. This Expert Group made 165 recommendations on a range of different issues\/sections of the legislation, including a change to Section 12, with a greater role for Authorised Officers. The Expert Group recommended that, in future, Authorised Officers should be the only group allowed to make an application for involuntary detention under Section 9 of the Act, and in cases where a person is taken into Garda custody under Section 12, an Authorised Officer would have to be contacted immediately to assess whether or not an application for involuntary detention should be made. These have been taken into account during the finalisation of the draft heads.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to these recommendations, the Department has carried out extensive consultation over the past few years, including a recent public consultation which received 100 submissions, and extensive engagement with key stakeholders such as the HSE and the Mental Health Commission.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme was approved by Cabinet today and will be published this month. The bill will then be drafted by the Office of the Attorney General with a view to introducing the legislation to the Oireachtas as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be\u00a0aware, the Department of Justice established a High Level Cross-Departmental and Cross Agency Task Force, which brings together senior officials from\u00a0the Department of Justice, the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Health and the HSE, the Central Mental Hospital, the Department of Housing and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.\u00a0 This Task Force is a commitment in the Programme for Government and is\u00a0considering the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned, and primary care supports on release.\u00a0 It is\u00a0chaired by Ms Kathleen Lynch, former Minister of State with responsibility for Primary Care, Mental Health and Disability. The group has established\u00a0a number of sub-groups which are focusing in the first instance on effective diversion from the criminal justice system; along with\u00a0capacity levels in the Central Mental Hospital and the Irish Prison Service; and also at community care and through-care from custody.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Applications for involuntary detention are never made lightly and applications made by any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na take full account of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&lsquo;s obligation to protect the human rights and welfare of individuals and communities.\u00a0The only statutory option available to Garda&iacute; responding to people in a mental health crisis and potentially posing a risk of harm to themselves or others is to invoke Section 12 of the Mental Health Act, 2001.\u00a0 Section 12 requires Garda&iacute; to take the person into custody\u00a0in order to\u00a0have them assessed by a registered medical practitioner.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Justice has confirmed that all trainee Garda&iacute;\u00a0are trained over two days in\u00a0an internationally recognised Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) workshop which is delivered in collaboration with the HSE.\u00a0 This workshop is a suicide first aid programme which equips trainee Garda&iacute; with the necessary skills to discuss suicide with a person at risk and to make an intervention to reduce immediate risk of suicide if necessary. Trainee Garda&iacute; also study the Mental Health Act 2001 and the procedures that are required if they have to invoke their powers.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Continuous Professional Development core programme for operational members, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has provided training on awareness of mental health difficulties in keeping with the Mental Health Act 2001. The programme also covers\u00a0types of mental health difficulties, Garda powers and procedures, and the transportation of people in mental health crisis.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy\u00a0may also be aware, the\u00a0Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland concluded\u00a0that societal issues such as the mental health of individuals should\u00a0not be the responsibility of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na alone and the Commission recommended the establishment of multi-agency teams that would include Garda&iacute; to respond to the needs of individuals with mental health issues.\u00a0 A pilot\u00a0crisis intervention team is being developed in the Limerick Garda Division.

In 2020, an additional &euro;2.2 million was allocated to develop telehealth and psychosocial responses to Covid-19. Telehealth services are now fully established while the HSE Psychosocial Framework, published in January 2021, provides a cohesive, coordinated, consistent and collaborative whole-of-population approach to the provision of mental health services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  I secured an additional &euro;50 million for mental health services in 2021, bringing the annual budget to in excess of &euro;1.1 billion. &euro;23 million of this additional funding is dedicated to commencing implementation of many of the short-term recommendations of Sharing the Vision while &euro;15M is allocated to address additional challenges posed by Covid-19. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, further developments in mental health services continue in line with the national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision and commitments set out in the HSE National Service Plan 2021. The &euro;23 million allocated to the implementation of Sharing the Vision\u00a0is funding enhanced resources for community mental health teams, CAMHS hubs\/teams, adult crisis resolution services, increased supports in employment, peer support workers, bereavement co-ordination, and dialectical behaviour therapy. Work is progressing in these areas, including the recruitment of the 153 new mental health staff this year.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision recommends the continued phased implementation and evaluation of existing national clinical programmes in mental health, including Dual Diagnosis, Early Intervention in Psychosis, and Eating Disorders.

Of the additional funding provided in 2021, &euro;7m will fund reconfiguration of mental health facilities, in line with Mental Health Commission and\u00a0 Covid-19 related risk assessment recommendations. This, plus the recurring &euro;6m in new development funding, means there is &euro;13 million for minor works and refurbishments in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, in 2020, the Government Covid-19 Stability Fund provided &euro;45 million to community organisations providing services, including social care.

In the health sector, the HSE has deployed rapid antigen tests for use for specific indications in the acute hospital setting, and as part of the response to outbreaks in the community setting, supported by appropriate clinical governance and operational arrangements. This includes updating the case definition for SARS-CoV-2 to accept notification of positive results from rapid antigen tests undertaken in the public health system and reporting of such cases to the COVID Care tracker and to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) information system developed to manage the surveillance and control of infectious diseases in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, supported by the HSE, has implemented an antigen testing programme in food processing facilities, supplementing the PCR serial testing programme there. These tests are being carried out under clinical governance arrangements put in place by the Department of Agriculture. A further rapid testing pilot scheme began on June 14th in four universities including NUI Galway, Trinity College Dublin, UCD, and UCC. Operational planning is also underway in the HSE in relation to the piloting of testing using RADTs in other education and childcare settings. This includes development of guidance documentation, a training programme and other related templates and resources to support the testing pathway for educational facilities.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Report of the COVID-19 Rapid Testing Group&rdquo; which was chaired at my request by the Government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Professor Mark Ferguson, and published on 1 April 2021, made a number of recommendations for sectors outside the health sector and these are a matter for the Ministers and Departments with responsibility for the sectors concerned.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has recently published the report of the Antigen Test Validation Project which validated a number of rapid antigen detection tests (ADTS) intended for testing samples for SARS-CoV-2 antigen.

The recommendations in this report will assist in the consideration of any other potential applications of rapid antigen detection tests to support the overall national testing strategy. <\/p>  <p>  I have established an Expert Advisory Group on Rapid Testing which will be chaired by Professor Mary Horgan, to support and advise Government departments who are responsible for progressing pilots and the rollout of rapid tests to their respective sectors.<\/p>  <p>  On an ongoing basis, the National Public Health Emergency Team considers and reviews how best to target testing to detect, and mitigate the impact of, the virus across the population.

The establishment of elective centres will avoid the cancellation and delays in care. <\/p><p>In 2019 the Sl&aacute;intecare Programme Implementation Office (SPIO) established an Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the Health Service Executive, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, to guide the development of the elective hospitals.

To develop the elective hospital capacity with a ten-year horizon of need, which facilitates the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care. <\/p><p>2. To provide quicker, higher quality, safer care for selected, elective patients. <\/p><p>3. To create capacity for acute hospital sites and reduce\/eliminate outlier boarding (trolleys). <\/p><p>4. To drive down waiting lists, both outpatient, inpatient and day case. <\/p><p>5. To reduce cancellations. <\/p><p>6. To reduce acute hospital footfall. <\/p><p>The Oversight Group is following the process outlined in the Public Spending Code, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Guide setting out the value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning and management of large public investment projects in Ireland. As required under the Code, a Strategic Assessment Report has been completed and approved for the development of Elective Hospital facilities. This sets out the rationale for investment, the alignment of the programme with strategic requirements of Government, some initial options and potential costs, and the governance of the programme. <\/p><p>The Preliminary Business Case (PBC), in accordance with the Public Spending Code, is also under preparation. As part of the PBC process, the Elective Hospitals Oversight Group made a public call for site submissions from members of the public, the HSE, Land Development Agency and Hospital Groups. The closing date for this call was 4 June. Sites submitted are undergoing evaluation to examine their suitability, including a multi-criteria assessment and cost effectiveness assessment with a view to the Preliminary Business Case recommending a single preferred site option in each of the three locations.  Only those sites submitted as part of the call for submissions and which were compliant with the requirements of the call are under consideration. <\/p><p>The site identification process in Cork and Galway has been fully informed by discussions with the South South-West Hospital Group. The site identification exercise sought submissions of sites sufficiently large to cater for future development needs in Cork, including new and replacement inpatient and outpatient facilities. The PBC is being developed with these future developments in mind.<\/p><p>Once completed, under the Public Spending Code, the PBC will be assessed by the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform and submitted to Government for its consideration. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":211,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF02750"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[28445\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if epidiolex will be approved for funding by the HSE drug reimbursement programme as a matter of urgency; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1611","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":213,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p><p>In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list.<\/p><p>Reimbursement is for licenced indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p><p>HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).<\/p><p>The HSE advises that, on 5 February 2020, it received two applications for the reimbursement of Epidyolex:<\/p><p>- for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.<\/p><p>- for use as adjunctive therapy of seizures associated with Dravet Syndrome in conjunction with clobazam, for patients two years of age and older.<\/p><p>On 5 February 2020, the HSE commissioned the NCPE to complete rapid reviews with respect to each of these indications.\u00a0 The NCPE recommended full health technology assessments (HTAs) to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Epidyolex compared with the current standard of care with respect to the above indications.

However, BAM, as a Tier 1 construction company, has global reach into supply chains and is doing its best to mitigate those risks.<\/p>  <p>  Despite delays and Covid-19 restrictions, significant progress is being made on the site at St James&rsquo;s and the new children&rsquo;s hospital building is taking shape.\u00a0 Over 90% of all concrete has been placed, with the concrete frame now complete. In March, a key milestone was reached when the last section of the seventh-storey was poured with concrete, meaning that the building has now topped out. \u00a0The infill concrete slabs over the steelwork frame, closing in the concourse, will be complete by August 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Glazing and fa&ccedil;ade works are continuing such that the distinctive shape of the building is becoming clear. It is anticipated that the majority of the building will be weathertight by the autumn. The fit out of certain internal areas has begun, with discernible rooms and areas taking shape. The primary Mechanical and Electrical Plant comprising boilers; combined heat and power, generators, transformers, main distribution boards and medical gases are well progressed with the focus now on primary and secondary distribution around the building.<\/p>  <p>  A major milestone was reached in July 2019, when the Urgent Care Centre at the Connolly Hospital campus opened, providing a new model of ambulatory care for children. The opening of the second of the three new campuses, at Tallaght Hospital later this year, will be another important milestone in the NCH programme and in the delivery of children&rsquo;s health services.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Construction work on the 4,600m2 facility is nearing an end, with a substantial completion date scheduled for September 2021. It will then be handed over to Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland to open for services after an 8-week period of operational commissioning and equipping. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Maternity Hospital","counter":227,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF03850"},{"type":"question","counter":228,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[37587\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF03900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of his latest efforts to progress the issue of the need for the new national maternity hospital to be in State ownership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":171,"qnumall":"[37597\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300073#WRF04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the current and expected position in regard to the proposed location of the new national maternity hospital; the extent to which all issues of concern have been addressed and resolved to date; if any further matters are outstanding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 171 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the development of the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH) planned for the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Campus at Elm Park, as set out in the Programme for Government. Significant progress has been made on the capital project, with planning permission for the hospital secured in 2017 and, in 2018, the awarding of the contract for substantial enabling works.<\/p>  <p>  However, the ownership and governance arrangements are more complex. The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new NMH at Elm Park were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which was finalised in 2016 following an extensive mediation process between the NMH and the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, published thereafter and noted by Government in 2017. The Mulvey Agreement provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services. The draft legal framework that has been developed is designed to copper fasten these arrangements. <\/p>  <p>  I have been very clear that I will not bring anything to Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new NMH.

This reconfiguration of services under the Progressing Disability Services for Children &amp;amp; Young People programme is in line with Health Service Reform and the implementation of Community Healthcare Networks under Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, 100 new posts have been allocated under the HSE National Service Plan 2021. Funding for these posts will facilitate each area to determine the discipline and grade required to address the gaps in their Children&rsquo;s Disability Network Teams. The 2021 allocation of posts is being assigned to the CHO areas in two tranches of 50 posts and will further strengthen the capacity of Network Teams.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":302,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH01450"},{"type":"question","counter":303,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[37681\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the supports he is providing to reduce waiting times for inpatient and day case procedures and outpatient appointments in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1553","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":304,"content":"<p>It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last sixteen months as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently as a result of the ransomware attack.<\/p><p>While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021, and the resultant curtailment of acute hospital services, is reflected in the most recently available waiting list figures to 13<sup>th<\/sup>May 2021.<\/p><p>On 23 March 2021 the HSE published the &ldquo;Safe Return to Health Services Plan&rdquo;, outlining a three phased approach for the proposed restoration of services across Community Services, Acute Hospital Operations, Cancer Services and Screening Services.

The timing of this, and other assemblies, over the lifetime of the Government has yet to be determined. One element critical to the success of assemblies has been the opportunity to meet in person. The restrictions experienced with Covid-19 have presented considerable difficulties in this regard, as meetings moved to being held online. The experiences and learning in this new way of working will inform how future citizen&rsquo;s assemblies are conducted.<\/p>  <p>  In 2019, the Government agreed to adopt a health-led approach\u00a0to people who use drugs, following\u00a0the publication of the report of the working group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use, which was informed by 20,000 public responses.\u00a0The approach will offer compassion, not punishment, to\u00a0people who use drugs.

Together with the health diversion programme, these initiatives align with the strategic priority in the EU Drugs Strategy\u00a0to provide alternatives\u00a0to coercive sanctions for people who use drugs.\u00a0 Ireland is committed to mainstream the implementation of effective measures that have a rehabilitative element and avoid a criminal sanction. To this end, Ireland will share comprehensive and in-depth data and exchange of best practices on alternatives to coercive sanctions with EU Member States.<\/p>  <p>The commencement of the Health Diversion Programme will demonstrate a health-led approach to drug use.

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and with Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.<\/p>  <p>  Under the National Eating Disorder Model of Care, there are plans to develop 2 mini eating disorder hubs in CHO5. It is anticipated that a CAMHS mini eating disorder hub will be developed in Waterford and an adult mini eating disorder hub in Kilkenny, both of which will link up with the larger eating disorder hub network. Importantly, adults with eating disorders can access treatment from local community mental health teams. There are currently 112\u00a0adult community mental health teams nationwide. Children and adolescents can similarly access treatment through the 72 CAMHS teams\u00a0 nationwide.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of &euro;3.94 million for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of 3 new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the 3 existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the expansion of the adult community team at the Mount Carmel site in Dublin, and this is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.<\/p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen real growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.<\/p>  <p>  As of last year, there are 3 specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, may require inpatient care for short periods for structured refeeding and\/or stabilisation.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS. One is the CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019).The other is in Dublin based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara in Dublin (8 beds) and Merlin Park in Galway (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need.<\/p>  <p>  There are plans for an eating disorder unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.<\/p>  <p>  For adults, people who may require in-patient care for short periods of time are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincents, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of 2 new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding annually to Bodywhys to run the helpline which is delivered by a team of trained volunteers. They also provide a range of services (support groups, online groups, email and family programmes) for adults and young people with eating disorders, and their families. The HSE also supports Bodywhys to run the PiLaR (Peer Led Resilience) Programme, a 4-week online modular based programme for parents, friends and carers of a person with an eating disorder to build resilience and gain support in their role as a carer. Additionally, in March 2019 the HSE launched the first Self Care App which provides valuable information for those with or people caring for someone with an eating disorder.<\/p>  <p>  People with eating disorders can additionally avail of our general mental health supports. The HSE provide a mental health text messaging support service, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers. Online counselling and supports are provided by Turn2Me, MyMind and other organisations. There are phone, text and email supports available through existing providers such as the Samaritans, Aware, Pieta and others. Furthermore, Jigsaw provides a variety of online, phone and text supports specifically to young people aged 12 to 25 years old.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual is concerned about themselves or someone known to them, they should be directed to their GP in the first instance for primary care screening assessment and examination. Their GP may then make recommendations which may include, if clinically indicated, referral to the secondary care mental health services for full eating disorder assessment.<\/p>  <p>  With the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care of the Elderly","counter":318,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH02550"},{"type":"question","counter":319,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[28428\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if HIQA stipulations that all elderly residents in care centres should have a personal space around their bed of 7.4 square metres will result in the loss of any beds at St. Josephs&rsquo; Hospital, Ennis.","asker":"1519","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":320,"content":"<p>The provision of residential care is part of a range of measures to offer a care system that reflects and responds to the varying needs of older people who require additional supports.<\/p>  <p>  The safety and quality of care provided to persons living in nursing homes is of the greatest importance.

The Eating Disorders Model of Care was launched in 2018 and was developed in partnership with the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and with Bodywhys, the national support group for people with eating disorders.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;1.77 million has been invested to date in eating disorder specialist posts, with 21.8 WTEs now in place. In addition, I secured the balance of &euro;3.94 million for 2021 and this will enable further investment in specialist posts throughout this year. More specifically, it will allow for the establishment of 3 new specialist eating disorder teams and the completion of the 3 existing specialist teams. Premises are already under development for the expansion of the adult community team at the Mount Carmel site in Dublin, and this is expected to be completed by the end 2021. Recruitment is progressing well for all teams.<\/p>  <p>  The funding allocated to date has seen real growth and improvement in our services. Despite the significant increase in referrals in 2020, there was a 43% increase in the number of eating disorder assessments completed compared to 2019, with twice as many people starting treatment.<\/p>  <p>  As of last year, there are 3 specialist eating disorder teams in place. This means that we can treat over 90% of people with eating disorders in the community, avoiding more serious inpatient treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Specialist outpatient treatment has been found to be the most effective and fastest way for most people with eating disorders to recover. Although there is good evidence that inpatient psychiatric care is not required for most people with eating disorders, it is recognised that a small number of people, mainly with restrictive eating disorders, may require inpatient care for short periods for structured refeeding and\/or stabilisation.<\/p>  <p>  There are currently 2 eating disorder specialist community teams based in CAMHS. One is the CHO4 Cork and Kerry Regional Eating Disorder Service CAREDS (operational since May 2019).The other is in Dublin based in CHO 7 Linn Dara Community Eating Disorder Service LDCEDS (operational since April 2018). Funding has been made available in 2021 to progress the recruitment of an additional CAMHS based eating disorder specialist community team in Community Healthcare West (Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, CHO2).<\/p>  <p>  In circumstances where in-patient care is required, child and adolescent care is provided in all of the 4 Regional CAMHS Units across the country. Linn Dara in Dublin (8 beds) and Merlin Park in Galway (6 beds) have dedicated a number of specialist eating disorder beds, while the remaining 2 CAMHS units accept relevant admissions of children with eating disorders. There is national coordination of child and adolescent admissions, with transfer arrangements in place as required by individual clinical need.<\/p>  <p>  There are plans for an eating disorder unit in the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital which will provide 8 additional beds. The HSE also funds individuals in private facilities. Decisions are made based on individual clinical need, as assessed by the local mental health team, and the prioritisation of available funding.<\/p>  <p>  For adults, people who may require in-patient care for short periods of time are admitted to local general adult approved centres and attend generic inpatient treatment programmes. CHO6 has 3 dedicated beds for eating disorders based in St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. The number of adult beds will increase, in line with the National Clinical Programme, including an additional 3 beds in St. Vincents, 5 beds in North Dublin, 5 beds in Galway and 5 beds in Cork. Timeframes for new beds will have to be established. These beds will be linked to eating disorder hubs. The funding available for 2021 will allow for the creation of 2 new adult eating disorder hubs in CHO4 and CHO9.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE provides funding annually to Bodywhys to run the helpline which is delivered by a team of trained volunteers. They also provide a range of services (support groups, online groups, email and family programmes) for adults and young people with eating disorders, and their families. The HSE also supports Bodywhys to run the PiLaR (Peer Led Resilience) Programme, a 4-week online modular based programme for parents, friends and carers of a person with an eating disorder to build resilience and gain support in their role as a carer. Additionally, in March 2019 the HSE launched the first Self Care App which provides valuable information for those with or people caring for someone with an eating disorder.<\/p>  <p>  People with eating disorders can additionally avail of our general mental health supports. The HSE provide a mental health text messaging support service, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days each week to connect people with trained volunteers. Online counselling and supports are provided by Turn2Me, MyMind and other organisations. There are phone, text and email supports available through existing providers such as the Samaritans, Aware, Pieta and others. Furthermore, Jigsaw provides a variety of online, phone and text supports specifically to young people aged 12 to 25 years old.<\/p>  <p>  If an individual is concerned about themselves or someone known to them, they should be directed to their GP in the first instance for primary care screening assessment and examination. Their GP may then make recommendations which may include, if clinically indicated, referral to the secondary care mental health services for full eating disorder assessment.<\/p>  <p>  With the right support and intervention, people can and do recover from eating disorders. The Government and the Department, along with the HSE and its partners, are committed to providing and expanding high-quality treatment and support for all those affected by eating disorders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cancer Services","counter":333,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH03550"},{"type":"question","counter":334,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[37676\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300075#WRH03600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when cancer services will be restored to full pre-Covid-19 capacity in the State.","asker":"1504","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":335,"content":"<p>The National Action Plan on Covid-19 identified the continued\u00a0provision of cancer care as a priority and cancer services continue to operate in line with guidance issued by the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP).\u00a0<\/p><p>The principles underpinning cancer care delivery during the pandemic remain key to efforts to mitigate the impact on services:\u00a0<\/p><p>- continuation of diagnostic services, particularly patients referred to Rapid Access Clinics;\u00a0<\/p><p>- continuation of treatment, considering the risk: benefit ratio for each individual patient;<\/p><p>- prioritising time-sensitive treatment across the cancer pathway;\u00a0reviewing the location of the delivery of cancer services to optimise patient safety and infection control;<\/p><p>- minimising any non-essential face to face patient contact,\u00a0 e.g. through the use of virtual assessment and triage where appropriate;<\/p><p>- optimising the potential for providing cancer services in private hospitals; and<\/p><p>- adherence to national guidance for all services as laid out by NCCP and the HSE&rsquo;s Chief Clinical Officer.<\/p><p>While the recent ransomware attack has had an impact on cancer services,\u00a0every effort is being made to maintain cancer services at present, with a particular focus on urgent and time-sensitive cases.<\/p><p>Funding of &euro;12m was allocated this year\u00a0for the restoration of cancer services to 95% of 2019 (pre-Covid) levels.\u00a0This funding is being used to:<\/p><p>- facilitate the expansion of capacity in diagnostic services in the context of Covid-19;<\/p><p>- support virtual clinics and more accurate triage;<\/p><p>- facilitate the better organisation of medical, radiation and surgical oncology in the context of increased organisational focus, social distancing and the provision of infection prevention &amp;amp; control measures;<\/p><p>- fund minor capital works to enable capacity restoration in medical oncology day wards; and<\/p><p>- support the continued provision of psycho-social supports to cancer patients and their families, including through the Together 4 Cancer Concern patient support initiative.<\/p><p>Furthermore, funding of &euro;20m has been allocated for the continued implementation of the National Cancer Strategy this year.

NBI also has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries. <\/p>  <p>  While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid 19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network resulting in delays to aspects of the programme. Impacts include challenges with mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations, supply chain and logistic delays (both nationally and internationally).\u00a0 Covid 19 has affected the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up including challenges associated with on-boarding and training people. Inevitably, like many other organisations, NBI and contractor staffs are at risk of contracting Covid 19 or may have to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact posing further challenges.\u00a0My Department has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the Contract to address the impacts of the Covid 19 pandemic on the project. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to seek to accelerate the roll out of the National Broadband Plan. The Department is currently engaging with NBI to explore the feasibility of accelerating aspects of the NBP rollout to establish the possibility of bringing forward premises which are currently scheduled in years 6 and 7 of the current plan to an earlier date. Exploring the potential to accelerate the network rollout is being undertaken in parallel with the measures required to mitigate delays arising as a result of Covid-19.\u00a0As part of that work NBI is engaging with all current build partners (eir and enet) to bring forward build activities and is also actively reviewing other possible build partners where such options could also speed up the build process. I am advised that these discussions are progressing well. <\/p>  <p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 8 July, 335 BCP sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly accessible sites and the Department of Education for school BCPs. \u00a0Of the 335 sites, some 116 schools have been installed with high speed broadband by NBI as part of this initiative, for educational access only.<\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the Department of Education to prioritise schools with no high speed broadband, within the Intervention Area, for connection over the term of the NBP. In this regard, an acceleration of this aspect of the National Broadband Plan was announced in December which will see some 679 primary schools connected to high speed broadband by 2022, well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.\u00a0 Further details are available on the NBI website at https:\/\/nbi.ie\/primary-schools-list\/\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300078#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1479"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord na M&oacute;na","counter":478,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300078#WRL03200"},{"type":"question","counter":479,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[37785\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300078#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"when he will respond to correspondence issued to him on 22 February 2021 in relation to a matter (details supplied) given that it relates to a community awaiting his response.","asker":"1604","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":480,"content":"<p>Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial State company, as set out in the Turf Development Acts.

This refers to a transport scheme&rsquo;s ability to impact upon a community&rsquo;s access to services and social amenities.\u00a0 These criteria form the high-level criteria for appraising the expected benefits and impact of the scheme. Sponsoring agencies preparing business cases for transport schemes are required to consider and assess if any accessibility and social impacts for the general public and in particular, vulnerable groups&mdash;either positive or negative&mdash;are likely to arise as a result of the investment. Such vulnerable groups include, for example, those experiencing social deprivation, geographic isolation, physical or intellectual impairment. It is required that, to the extent that is possible, the scale of the anticipated impacts is set out within the appraisal, along with the specific groups likely to be impacted and how many people in those groups are likely to be impacted. <\/p><p>In respect of the requirements outlined above, I also note that the Strategic Research and Analysis Division in my Department is currently undertaking a work programme to review, update and improve the Departments existing sectoral guidance (the Common Appraisal Framework for Transport Projects and Programmes 2016).\u00a0 This review and update will reflect the new requirements for evaluating, planning and measuring public investment as set out in the recently revised Public Spending Code published at the end of 2019.

On 1 June, the Government approved the extension of EWSS to 31 December 2021 as a key policy instrument to continue to provide the necessary employment support for eligible businesses. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Regarding eligibility for the scheme up until 30 June 2021, an employer had to be\u00a0 able to demonstrate that his or her business would experience a 30% reduction in turnover or orders between 1 January and 30 June 2021, by reference to the corresponding period in 2019, as a result of business disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, the position is that for EWSS claims from 1 July 2021, the reference period against which the turnover condition will be judged has been broadened out from a six month period to a full year so that turnover in the full year 2021 is compared with that for the full year in 2019, with appropriate arrangements for qualifying businesses who may not have been in operation for all of 2019.\u00a0\u00a0All other things being equal, this should allow a greater number of firms to qualify for the scheme than would be the case if the a six month reference period along the lines of that mentioned above had been retained.

From 21 July 2021, completing and submitting an EWSS Eligibility Review Form to Revenue will be necessary to avail of EWSS supports, with details of an employer&rsquo;s monthly eligibility review check to be submitted by the 15th   of the following month.\u00a0 For example, the eligibility review undertaken on the last day of July will need to be completed and submitted to Revenue by 15 August. <\/p>  <p>  Timely submission of the form will provide assurance to both employers and Revenue that subsequent EWSS claims are appropriate and in line with the terms of the scheme.

The law is prescriptive and lists the various type of investment services and investment products falling to be regulated.\u00a0 Regulated firms may also sell investment products which are not specifically mentioned in the law (i.e. unregulated products). Consequently regulated firms are not prohibited from providing services in relation to unregulated products. Where they do so, certain investor protections, which apply to regulated activities, are not applicable to unregulated products.<\/p>  <p>  However, regulated firms subject to the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code (CPC) that provide financial services to consumers in relation to unregulated financial products, must comply with provisions 4.8 and 4.9 of the Central Bank&rsquo;s CPC. These provisions state the following:\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  4.8 A regulated entity may only use the regulatory disclosure statement in communications with a consumer where such communications relate solely to a regulated activity.<\/p>  <p>  4.9 A regulated entity must have separate sections on any website it operates, for regulated activities and any other activities which it carries out.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, the Pensions Authority is currently investigating if there are any pension scheme trustee duty issues of concern related to this case. The Pensions Authority has a mandate to investigate the behaviour and activities of Pension Scheme Trustees, and it has been noted that the relevant pension vehicles which are involved in this case are one member arrangement schemes, known as small self-administered schemes (SSAPs) and non-standard Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSA). You will appreciate that it will be for the Pensions Authority to take whatever actions it deems appropriate under its mandate.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Consumers may have recourse to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) in relation to financial services provided to them by regulated firms. The FSPO is the statutory body tasked with the investigation, mediation and adjudication of complaints about the conduct of financial or pension service providers. It is worth noting that the FSPO is empowered to investigate complaints of mis-selling by regulated financial service providers and has carried out investigations in this area in the past. If a consumer wishes to pursue a complaint in relation to a regulated financial service provider, they must firstly make a complaint to the provider. If the complaint is not resolved, they can then make a complaint to the FSPO. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The FSPO has the power to direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;500,000 to a complainant. The FSPO can also direct that a financial service provider rectify the conduct that is the subject of the complaint.

This analysis is available on budget.gov.ie and shows that each of those Budget packages were broadly progressive. In relation to Budget 2021, this analysis concluded that the lowest four income deciles benefitted the most as a proportion of disposable income, a finding which was supported by the ESRI&rsquo;s own analysis of the budgetary package. <\/p>  <p>  Over Budgets 2017-2021 my Department also published an analysis of the progressivity of the income tax and welfare system. This is a cross country comparison of the degree to which our tax and welfare systems reduce income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient. The latest analysis showed that Ireland recorded the second highest reduction in income inequality in the OECD between market incomes, i.e. before tax and welfare measures, and disposable incomes, after tax and welfare measures. <\/p>  <p>  Outside of the budgetary process, as part of the review of the Local Property Tax in 2019, the distributional impact which a number of illustrative scenarios could be expected to have on levels of disposable household income was modelled across varying income deciles, and results shown relative to a no policy change baseline using the ESRI&rsquo;s SWITCH model. This distributional impact assessment was undertaken in order to assess the relative progressivity of each scenario. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, for a number of years, the annual Tax Strategy Group (TSG) paper on income tax has provided an overview of the distribution and burden of income tax and USC across income earners. Depending on the particular issue(s) under consideration by the TSG in any given year, further social impact assessments may be included in the TSG paper. For example, the recent income tax TSG papers included analysis in respect of equality proofing and gender proofing of certain aspects of the income tax system. In addition, the Department of Finance regularly carries out reviews of tax expenditures. By way of example, the Home Carers Tax Credit was reviewed in 2019 and included an assessment of the credit in terms of its impact on gender and household income coverage. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, in recent years, there has been increasing moves internationally to broaden attempts to estimate the living standards of the population beyond traditional aggregate economic statistics such as GDP.\u00a0 In recognition of this, my Department published a paper on Well-being and the Measurement of Broader Living Standards in Ireland with Budget 2021. The Programme for Government also committed to developing new measures of well-being in order to create a broader context for policy-making. An expert group to guide the development of a national well-being framework has now been convened through the Department of the Taoiseach, with the Department of Finance a member and a joint sponsor of the work.\u00a0 It is anticipated that the new well-being measures can serve, over time, as a useful reference for a range of policy and budgetary reform initiatives which are currently underway, including: performance budgeting, equality budgeting, spending reviews and proofing of policy proposals against environmental and other goals.<\/p>  <p>  As the development of budgetary policy is not within their remit, the bodies under the aegis of my Department do not undertake social impact assessments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":650,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO02500"},{"type":"question","counter":651,"qnumday":267,"qnumall":"[37318\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"when the public consultation process on the OECD corporation tax proposals will commence; the terms of reference for the process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1599","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":652,"content":"<p>On 1 July 2021, the OECD Inclusive Framework reached agreement but not full consensus on key aspects of the two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation and globalisation.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Pillar One proposes a re-allocation of a proportion of tax to the market jurisdiction, while Pillar Two seeks to apply a global minimum effective tax rate.

This means that each partner is chargeable to tax on her\/his own income and is entitled to the basic annual personal tax credit of &euro;1,650. Neither partner will be entitled to the increased standard rate cut-off point and, tax credits, tax bands, and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.<\/p><p>Parts 44 and 44A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide for joint assessment of a couple for tax purposes. However, joint assessment is available only to married persons or civil partners who live together. Joint assessment for other cohabiting couples is not provided for in the tax code.<\/p><p>Information on the taxation of cohabiting couples can be found on the Revenue website, available at .<\/p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution which compels the State to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.<\/p><p>Differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples arise from the objective of dealing with different circumstances while also respecting the constitutional requirement to protect the institution of marriage. Cohabitants do not have the same legal rights and obligations as a married couple or couple in a civil partnership which is why they are not accorded similar tax treatment to couples who have a civil status that is recognised in law. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.<\/p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners. Married couples and civil partners have a verifiable official confirmation of their status. It would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting. It would also be difficult to establish when cohabitation started or ceased. There would also be legal issues with regard to &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo;. To counter tax avoidance, &lsquo;connected persons&rsquo; are frequently defined throughout the various Tax Acts. The definitions extend to relatives and children of spouses and civil partners. This would be very difficult to prove and enforce, in respect of persons connected with a cohabiting couple where the couple has no legal recognition. There may be an advantage in tax legislation for a married couple or civil partners as regards the extended rate band and the ability to transfer credits. However, their legal status has wider consequences from a tax perspective both for themselves and persons connected with them.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the difference in tax treatment for married couples is not confined to Income Tax, and is also a feature of other taxes, such as Capital Acquisitions Tax. Therefore, any changes in the tax treatment could only be considered in the broader context of the tax system and future social and legal policy development more generally, given that the legal status of married couples has wider consequences than from a tax perspective.<\/p><p>The arrangements and associated legislation for the purposes of payments or allowances under the remit of the Department of Social Protection in relation to married couples, civil partners and cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Social Protection and her Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":665,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO04000"},{"type":"question","counter":666,"qnumday":272,"qnumall":"[37571\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300081#WRO04100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that persons will lose their no-claims car insurance bonus if a third party makes a claim for a relatively small amount against them, for example, for a scratch, resulting in the insured party paying thousands of euro extra on their premium each year; his plans to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":667,"content":"<p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither the Minister for Finance, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, has any influence over the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter assessed on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 This position is reinforced by the EU legislative framework for insurance (the\u00a0Solvency II\u00a0Directive). <\/p>  <p>  On a general level, my understanding is that insurers will use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms to apply.\u00a0 For example, in relation to motor insurance, factors may include those such as: the age of the driver and the relevant driving experience; as well as the age and type of vehicle; how the vehicle is used; the claims record; the number of drivers; and the location of storage.\u00a0 Insurers also price in accordance with their own past claims experience, and do not all use the same combination of rating factors, so as a result prices vary across the market.

This report examined the tax treatment of financial products subject to DIRT and financial products subject to life assurance exit tax (LAET). \u00a0It concluded the products subject to DIRT and products subject to LAET are different in a number of respects, namely, the level and application of fees to clients, the level of risk and return and potential losses, and hence the way in which they are taxed.<\/p><p>This was further \u00a0reviewed in the most recent Capital and Savings Taxes Tax Strategy Group paper, published in September 2020. The conclusion was that the option to reduce rates of LAET to 33% would cost &euro;22 million in a full year, and that it could have potential consequences for the tax treatment of other similar investment products. It was also felt that given the current fiscal pressures, the possibility of reducing the rate of LAET is significantly diminished, particularly given the lack of evidence to support any distortionary impact of the rate.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":698,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP01500"},{"type":"question","counter":699,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[37992\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP01600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his Department has considered extending the employment wage subsidy scheme to the owners of private childcare cr&egrave;ches; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1449","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":700,"content":"<p>Section 28B of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides for the operation of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), which is an economy-wide enterprise support for eligible businesses in respect of eligible employees.

For Q3 2021, the Government has decided to broadly maintain the status quo for EWSS, including the enhanced rates of support, with a modification to widen eligibility, and maintaining the reduced rate of Employers&rsquo; PRSI of 0.5%.<\/p>  <p>  While the Government has agreed that the EWSS should be extended to end Q4 2021, it is too early as yet to prescribe the precise operational parameters of the scheme that should apply for that quarter. Decisions in that regard will be taken closer to the time, possibly around the end of August\/early September, with the benefit of more up-to-date information on a number of variables, including the overall epidemiological situation, progress made in reopening all sectors of the economy, the vaccine efficacy, as well as the operation of the EWSS during the early parts of Q3.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, no decisions have been taken in relation to future of the scheme beyond the end of Q4, 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that, as the recovery gains further momentum, supports are further recalibrated in the longer-term interests of businesses that are in receipt of those supports and in the interests of the wider body of taxpayers. As such, and as already signalled, for Q4, consideration will be given to a future change to EWSS which will require an employer contribution towards employee wages. The precise manner in which such a change might be implemented is a matter to be considered.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s question refers to extending the EWSS to\u00a0owners of private childcare cr&egrave;ches.\u00a0 \u00a0However, it is unclear what\u00a0the Deputy might be specifically referring to.\u00a0 As outlined above, all qualifying employers are entitled to claim the EWSS and in the case of the childcare sector, childcare businesses in possession of tax clearance and registered in accordance with Section 58C of the Childcare Act 1991 are eligible for the EWSS, in respect of the eligible employees on their payroll.<\/p>  <p>  In the event that the Deputy is referring to sole traders who run private childcare cr&egrave;ches, it should be noted that the EWSS provides a flat-rate subsidy to qualifying employers based on the number of qualifying employees on the payroll. Subject to meeting the requisite conditions, a sole-trader&rsquo;s business may be a qualifying employer for the purpose of the scheme, the same as is the case for any other employer. As was the case under the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS), sole-traders are not able to claim the EWSS in respect of their own employment as they are not employees &ndash; and further, may not necessarily be paid via the payroll system unlike proprietary directors who are obliged to have PAYE operated on any payments made to them personally.<\/p>  <p>  The EWSS is a significant economy wide support for employers, but it is not the only measure that the Government have put in place to support businesses at this time.<\/p>  <p>  There are a range of other business support measures available. For those businesses who may need additional support during this period, I would draw attention to the comprehensive package of other business and employer supports that have been made available since the July Stimulus Plan and Budget 2021 - including the Covid Restriction Support Scheme (CRSS) which has been extended, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme. I also announced on 1st June last a new additional business support scheme (Business Resumption Support Scheme or BRSS) for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions to be implemented in September 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains fully committed to supporting businesses and employers insofar as is possible at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":701,"content":"<p>Question No. 285 answered with Question No. 269.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":703,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP02000"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP01900"},{"type":"question","counter":703,"qnumday":286,"qnumall":"[37181\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP02000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"his plans to allocate Tusla the required additional expenditure necessary to fund posts for those working in section 39 organisations in order to achieve pay parity and pay restoration following the award achieved by HSE section 39 organisations at the WRC; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1517","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":704,"content":"<p>I appreciate the valuable work of the community and voluntary sector that provide services to children, young people and families across Ireland.\u00a0 The issues raised in the Deputy&rsquo;s question relate to the funding of such organisations.

Flood Mitigation Scheme towards these works. \u00a0While work is currently ongoing on the development of a solution, the Council is not yet in a position to confirm the programme times in relation to planning approvals and construction.<\/p><p>Following the flood event, which occurred in August, 2020 in the Rossa Road area, Cork County Council and its consultants have been undertaking assessments of the problem. \u00a0While all assessments are not yet finalised, some discussions have taken place with a local landowner with a view to completing some remedial\/improvement works this summer. \u00a0Any further works can only be progressed once the required reports are completed.<\/p><p><b>Bandon:<\/b><\/p><p>The <b>Bandon<\/b>Flood Relief Scheme was substantially completed on 16th October 2020.<\/p><p>A number of additional minor items are still planned to be completed, such as fencing, railings and conservation works to Bandon Bridge.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing on preparing the operation and maintenance plans for the scheme and it is envisaged that the maintenance and operation of the scheme will be carried out for and on behalf of the OPW by Cork County Council. <\/p><p>As part of the recently completed flood relief scheme for Bandon, the Office of Public Works installed a large &lsquo;rock-ramp&rsquo; fish pass in the Bandon River, measuring some 130m, in October 2018.\u00a0 The rock ramp was essential to mitigate the impact on fish passage at the weir, which arose from deepening the channel downstream of the weir.\u00a0 The fish pass was designed by international experts, with input from national experts in the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government (DECLH), along with Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI).<\/p><p>In March 2021, the OPW became aware that the boulders, rock and gravel material that formed the bed of the ramp had deteriorated, possibly as a result of extreme flows in the river in February 2021. The OPW immediately carried out inspections, accompanied by IFI representatives and the fisheries&rsquo; specialist on the Project.<\/p><p>The site inspections identified serious deterioration of the rock and gravel bed materials used in the construction of the fish pass, over its full length.\u00a0 Of immediate concern was the erosion of bed material at the upstream end of the fish pass, which had resulted in the retaining wall, originally constructed below the bed level of the pass, becoming exposed and creating a &lsquo;step&rsquo; up from the bed level immediately downstream of it.\u00a0 The situation was creating serious difficulties for various aquatic species in migrating over this newly exposed &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the fish pass, particularly in low flows.<\/p><p>The OPW and IFI agreed that urgent measures needed to be implemented to alleviate this problem.\u00a0 An Appropriate Assessment Screening was completed, in line with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, and an AA Determination Statement was prepared. The proposed solution comprised large, natural boulders placed in a line across the width of the fish pass - close to the &lsquo;step&rsquo; at the upstream end of the pass - to create a pool from which the fish can pass with greater ease.<\/p><p>Following consultations with landowners for access for the proposed works and following environmental approval, the emergency works were successfully completed. <\/p><p>While these emergency works were critical in solving the immediate problem, an investigation into the reasons for the deterioration of the bed material on the fish pass has commenced and a longer term solution will be developed with a view to fully rectifying the issue with the carrying out of any necessary works when the investigations are completed. <\/p><p><b>Clonakilty:<\/b><\/p><p>The <b>Clonakilty<\/b>Flood Relief Scheme undertaken by the Office of Public Works in partnership with Cork County Council was substantially completed on 4th February 2021 by the main contractor, Ward and Burke Ltd and now provides protection to 296 properties.<\/p><p>A number of minor works to address outstanding items and snags will be completed by the contractor during the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Planning for the operation and maintenance of the scheme is ongoing in conjunction with Cork County Council, who will act as agents of the OPW in carrying out the statutory operation and maintenance of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1494"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":731,"content":"<p>Question No. 295 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":732,"content":"<p>Question No. 296 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":733,"content":"<p>Question No. 297 answered with Question No. 294.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","counter":735,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP05200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Outdoor Events","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":298,"qnumall":"[37201\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300082#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"her plans to scale up and increase attendances at outdoor sports and cultural events following the recent successful pilot live events: when an updated plan will be published for July, August and September 2021; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>From 5 July the numbers permitted at outdoor organised events have increased to a maximum of 200 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 500 for outdoor stadia\/venues with a minimum accredited capacity of 5,000.\u00a0\u00a0As part of the Government's phase plan for reopening our economy and society, we will again consider COVID-19 restrictions before the 19th of July.<\/p>  <p>  COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease, which spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. \u00a0In certain settings, such as live performances and sporting events, higher noise levels, can force people into close proximity or require them to raise their voices or shout to communicate thus increasing the risk of spreading virus to others.\u00a0 Such activities present a higher risk of transmission of COVID-19.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As such, our approach to easing restrictions must continue to be cautious, gradual and phased, with sufficient time between any easing of measures to assess the impact.

An Expert Panel was established in 2016 to investigate the matter. It was chaired by Mr. Denis McCarthy and it included representatives nominated by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland, and the Institute of Geologists of Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The report of the expert panel\u00a0was published on\u00a013 June 2017. It concluded that the disintegration of the concrete blocks used in the construction of the affected dwellings in Donegal and Mayo was primarily due to excessive amounts of deleterious materials in the aggregate used to manufacture the concrete blocks. The deleterious material in Donegal was primarily muscovite mica and in Mayo it was primarily reactive pyrite.<\/p>  <p>  On the 31 January 2020, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, made Regulations to provide for a grant scheme to support affected homeowners in Donegal and Mayo. The Department subsequently prepared and issued guidelines on the operation of the scheme to both Councils to assist them in the administration of the scheme. The scheme opened for applications in June 2020. <\/p>  <p>  The resulting Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme is a grant scheme of financial assistance to support affected homeowner(s) to remediate their dwelling, where their dwelling has been damaged by the use of defective concrete blocks in its construction. The grant scheme applies to the owners of dwellings (located in Donegal or Mayo), which are damaged due to defective concrete blocks containing excessive amounts of deleterious materials namely mica or pyrite. The dwelling must be the individual&rsquo;s principal private residence.<\/p>  <p>  The goal of the grant scheme is to help a restricted group of homeowners who have no other practicable option to remediate their home. It is not a compensation scheme but a mechanism for the State to help ordinary homeowners to remediate defects to their principal private residence and return their homes to the condition they would have been in had they not been built with defective concrete blocks.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2021 provides funding of &euro;20 million to fund the operation of the Defective Concrete Blocks Grant scheme for the counties of Donegal and Mayo. At this stage\u00a0475\u00a0stage one\u00a0applications (377 in Donegal and 98 in Mayo) have been submitted and nearly 70% have been approved.<\/p>  <p>  In response to concerns about the scheme which have been raised by homeowners\u00a0I\u00a0established a time-bound working group, with representatives from my Department, the local authorities and homeowner representative groups, to review any outstanding issues in relation to the operation of the scheme, including issues such as grant caps, homeowner contributions, engineering and allowable costs etc. I\u00a0expect\u00a0that the\u00a0review, to be undertaken by the working group, will\u00a0be completed by 31 July and will inform any changes or improvements to the scheme as may be required.

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.<\/p><p>If a household has been deemed eligible for social housing support, it is a matter for the local authority to examine the suite of social housing supports available, including the HAP scheme, to determine the most appropriate form of social housing support for that household.<\/p><p>The 2011 Regulations prescribe maximum net\u00a0income limits\u00a0for each local authority, in different bands according to the area concerned, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy. The 2011 Regulations do not provide local authorities with any discretion to exceed the limits that apply to their administrative areas.<\/p><p>Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for\u00a0social housing\u00a0assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax,\u00a0PRSI, Universal Social Charge and Additional Superannuation Contribution. The Policy provides for a range of income disregards, and local authorities also have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once-off in nature.\u00a0However, with the exception of the specific payments listed in the Household Means Policy as being disregarded, all income from social insurance and social assistance payments, allowances and benefits, and maintenance payments received is assessable. There is no provision in the policy to deduct any other regular outgoings, such as maintenance paid in respect of family members, from gross household income for the purposes of the income threshold.<b><\/b><\/p><p>The income bands are expressed in terms of a maximum net income threshold for a single-person household, with an allowance of 5% for each additional adult household member, subject to a maximum allowance under this category of 10%; and separately, an allowance of 2.5% for each child.<\/p><p>The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced in 2011 also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.\u00a0<\/p><p>Given the cost to the State of providing social housing, it is considered prudent and fair to direct resources to those most in need of social housing support. The current income eligibility requirements generally achieve this, providing for a fair and equitable system of identifying those households facing the greatest challenge in meeting their accommodation needs from their own resources.<\/p><p>However, as part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports in each local authority area is underway. The review will have regard to current initiatives being brought forward in terms of affordable housing both for purchase and for cost rental.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300084#WRR01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Reviews","counter":822,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300084#WRR01900"},{"type":"question","counter":823,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[37296\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300084#WRR02000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the details of the social impact assessments carried out by his Department and public bodies and agencies under his remit since 1 January 2016;

Section 42 of the Act currently enables the holder of a planning permission to apply to a planning authority for an extension to the period of permission by an additional period not exceeding 5 years. <\/p>  <p>  If an extension to planning permission has been previously granted, the only circumstance in which the holder of a planning permission may be granted a\u00a0further extension of duration is under\u00a0section 42(1A) of the Act in respect of a development that relates to 20 or more houses, where substantial works have been carried out,\u00a0subject to the development being completed within 5 years of the originally extended permission or by 31 December 2021 (as extended by Government Orders under Section 251A of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in 2020), whichever first occurs.<\/p>  <p>  Section 7 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2021\u00a0('the 2021 Act') provides a temporary provision allowing for applications for further extensions of planning permissions which have already availed of an extension under section 42, or otherwise under section 42(1A),\u00a0and in circumstances where\u00a0no further extension is\u00a0permissible.

In other words, this provision does\u00a0not provide a blanket extension of duration for a certain class or classes of developments, but rather must be determined on a case by case basis by the relevant planning authority upon application to that authority.<\/p>  <p>  It is case that\u00a0construction work has been significantly impacted, with both delays and site closures throughout 2020 and 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic and associated restrictions, and most recently with the closure of non-essential construction sites on the 8 January 2021, which sites could only have reopened in April and May of this year at earliest. It is therefore envisaged that an additional extension of 2\u00a0years or until 31 December 2023, which ever first occurs, is an appropriate period\u00a0to address the disruption and delays to construction caused by Covid-19 pandemic and resulting restrictions.\u00a0This period\u00a0not only takes into account the period of restrictions on construction,\u00a0but also addresses delays and disruptions in\u00a0logistics, supply chains, and the availability of personnel when restarting construction work after the mandatory and unplanned closure of building sites over the last year. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300085#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":908,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300085#WRS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":909,"qnumday":360,"qnumall":"[37764\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300085#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if local authorities retain 100% of the local property tax paid by them in regard to social housing.","asker":"1453","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":910,"content":"<p>The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, sets out the position concerning residential properties and liability for the Local Property Tax (LPT).

I am pleased to report good progress in addressing matters in this area. <\/p>  <p>  In December 2018, my Department formed a Working Group on Disability Voting to bring together representatives of the Department, persons with disabilities and representative organisations such as the National Disability Agency, the National Council for the Blind and the Irish Wheelchair Association. The Group is working to improve accessibility of voting for voters with physical disabilities, and its work has been particularly focused on the following issues:<\/p>  <p>  Improving accessibility to polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, with the goal of all polling stations being fully accessible as soon as possible;<\/p>  <p>  Reviewing and updating, as required, the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Accessible Voting Checklist&rsquo;, which addresses improved accessibility within polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users; <\/p>  <p>  Developing and improving Ballot Paper Templates (BPTs) - plastic devices with tactile features which are overlaid on ballot papers to enable blind and vision-impaired people to vote in private at electoral events; and<\/p>  <p>  Promoting measures to advance voting accessibility, as set out in Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p>  <p>  BPTs were used for the first time at the Referendum held in May 2018 and have been in use in all other electoral events since then. Good progress has also been made in recent years by Returning Officers in reducing the number of polling stations that are not fully accessible by voters with physical disabilities. <\/p>  <p>  Recognising that people with disabilities have particular needs, my Department endeavours to ensure that the voting process is as accessible and inclusive as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The Electoral Acts provide for a range of measures to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities, including:<\/p>  <p>  The requirement on local authorities, in making polling schemes, to appoint as polling places areas where at least one polling station will be accessible to wheelchair users;<\/p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers, where practicable, to provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users and to give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to  wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested that consideration should be given to providing suitable ramps in the case of polling stations that cannot be reached without negotiating steps;<\/p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers to put in place arrangements to facilitate the marking and placing in the ballot box of ballot papers by wheelchair users. In guidance to Returning Officers, my Department has suggested the provision at each polling station of an appropriately located table and chair to facilitate this requirement;<\/p>  <p>  The requirement on Returning Officers to ensure, where practicable, that the place appointed for the counting of votes is accessible to wheelchair users. <\/p>  <p>  If an elector anticipates difficulty in gaining access to his or her polling station, he or she may apply in writing to the Returning Officer for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency. Furthermore, a person with a physical disability or illness which prevents him or her from going to the polling station can vote by post if he or she applies to be included in the postal voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. A person residing in a hospital, nursing home or similar institution who has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, can vote at the hospital or nursing home if they apply to be included in the special voters list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors. In order to be entered on the postal or special voters list, a person must apply to the appropriate local authority by 25 November each year. After that date, an application for inclusion on the supplement to the postal or special voters list may be made. In addition, electoral law provides that voters who are unable to vote without assistance may avail of companion voting or they may seek the assistance of the Presiding Officer. <\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government - Our Shared Future - commits to the establishment of an Electoral Commission. In January 2021, the General Scheme of an Electoral Reform Bill was published which sets out the legislative basis for the Commission.

The ESP includes capital grants for the maintenance and development of Irish community centres and for innovative projects such as the prestigious, new Irish Arts Centre in New York.

Therefore, the pension element of their contributions paid is not refundable.<\/p>  <p>  It remains open to the person concerned to apply for State pension (non-contributory).\u00a0 On receipt of a completed application form, their eligibility for this pension can be determined and they will be notified in writing of the decision.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy.\u00a0 <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Births","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":450,"qnumall":"[37494\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX01800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if her attention has been drawn to difficulties in the registration of births in the civil registration service due to the handwriting of birth notifications from some maternity hospitals following the cyber-attack on the HSE; the steps she is taking to facilitate the registration of births while manual systems are being operated in maternity hospitals; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1594","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>The Deputy will be aware that the processes for the notification of births is the responsibility of the maternity services and the HSE registration services.\u00a0\u00a0My Department has no direct role with respect to such matters.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the delays being suffered by the public as the HSE deals with the backlog of\u00a0births and deaths registrations caused by the cyber-attack on HSE systems.\u00a0 Some four weeks of registration activity was lost.\u00a0 The HSE has advised my Department that contingency arrangements are in place for the\u00a0Dublin based maternity services where electronic\u00a0birth notifications cannot be sent.\u00a0\u00a0 The HSE has further advised that\u00a0electronic notification of births\u00a0from the\u00a0Coombe and Rotunda\u00a0maternity hospitals has been restored with some transfer of data for late May and early June still necessary.\u00a0\u00a0The systems in place for the National Maternity Hospital are not yet restored and staff are providing\u00a0handwritten or manual\u00a0notifications to the Eastern Region civil registration office.\u00a0\u00a0The HSE is unable to say when its IT systems will be fully restored.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the hospital and registration staff are working to resolve any matters that arises on a case by case basis.\u00a0 In cases where a birth certificate contains clerical errors, the parent(s) can seek to have these corrected by\u00a0applying to the superintendent registrar at a civil registration office of their choosing.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Benefits","counter":1185,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX02000"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":451,"qnumall":"[37525\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300090#WRX02100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 427 of 22 June 2021, if her Department has reviewed the recent ESRI report Covid-19 and the Irish Welfare System, particularly with regard to its estimated cost of increasing jobseeker&rsquo;s rates from &euro;112.70 to &euro;203, an amount of &euro;159 million to &euro;169 million in comparison with the estimated figure of &euro;64.8 million; the way her Department arrived at the calculation for the estimated figures provided; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1187,"content":"<p>While my Department and I have reviewed the Budget Perspectives 2022 paper with interest, I am not in a position to comment in detail on the specific methodology or assumptions which were used\u00a0to cost measures\u00a0by the ESRI.

The National Domestic Violence Helpline, run by Women&rsquo;s Aid, is also available to callers of all genders on a 24 hour basis.

The degree of support provided through AIM depends on the needs of the child in the context of the pre-school service. The levels of support include:<\/p>  <p>  Universal supports (Levels 1-3)<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 1, which aims to embed an inclusive culture in services, includes the national inclusion policy and guidelines for ECCE, the funding of the LINC training programme in Leadership for Inclusion, the establishment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator roles in ECCE settings, and a small increase in capitation for services with qualified Inclusion Coordinators.<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 2 involves provision of information for parents and providers on AIM, through the AIM.gov.ie website and information provided by County\/City Childcare Committees.<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 3 recognises the requirement to continue to develop a qualified workforce that can confidently meet the needs of all children participating in the ECCE Programme. Supports include funding of training courses such as Hanen, L&aacute;mh and Sensory Processing E-Learning (SPEL).<\/p>  <p>  Targeted supports (Levels 4-7)<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 4 addresses the needs of early years practitioners to have timely access to advice and support from experts in early learning and care (and disability in particular) to assist them meet each child&rsquo;s needs.<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 5 recognises that some children require specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and\/or that some early learning and care settings may require minor structural alterations to ensure children with a disability can participate in the ECCE programme. Supports include grants for equipment and some minor capital building works.<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 6 provides access to therapeutic supports where they are critical to enable a child be enrolled, and fully participate, in the ECCE programme.<\/p>  <p>  -  Level 7: Additional assistance in the pre-school room involves additional capitation for service providers where an application process has demonstrated that supports Level 1-6\u00a0 have not, or will not, by themselves, meet the child&rsquo;s needs. Funding can be used by the provider to buy in additional support, or reduce the staff \/ child ratio, supporting the pre-school leader to ensure the child&rsquo;s optimal participation.<\/p>  <p>  In total, 15,321 children have so far benefited from targeted AIM supports since AIM began in 2016.

For the 2021\/22 academic year, student grant applications will be assessed based on gross income from all sources for the period 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020. <\/p>  <p>  Particular priority is afforded to those on the lowest incomes and social welfare dependents through the\u00a0special rate of grant, which is\u00a0payable at the higher non-adjacent rate of &euro;5,915 or the adjacent rate of &euro;2,375, depending on the distance travelled to the college attended.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In assessing an application for the 2021\/22\u00a0academic year, SUSI will have regard to the following qualifying criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant:<\/p>  <p>  1. The student must qualify for the standard rate of grant;<\/p>  <p>  2. Total reckonable income, after income disregards and Child Dependant Increase(s) are excluded, must\u00a0not\u00a0exceed &euro;24,500;<\/p>  <p>  3. As at 31st December 2020, the reckonable income must include one of the eligible long-term social welfare payments prescribed in Schedule 2 of the Student Grant Scheme 2021.<\/p>  <p>  As in any statutory scheme, a core principle of the student grant scheme\u00a0is that there is consistency of approach and an equitable treatment for applicants as part of the means assessment process. All applications are assessed nationally with reference to the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme. The terms and conditions of funding are applied impartially to all applicants.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2020 establishes the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment as a social insurance benefit scheme separate from other social protection statutory schemes including the Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseeker Benefit schemes. <\/p>  <p>  For student grant purposes the Covid-19 payment has been treated as reckonable income for the SUSI means assessment process since it was introduced in March 2020. This means that the Covid-19 payment is treated in a similar fashion to other Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments such as Jobseekers Benefit\/Allowance, thus ensuring a consistency of approach and an equitable treatment of students and their families in the SUSI means assessment process. <\/p>  <p>  However, the Student Grant Scheme also makes provision for combining periods of Pandemic Unemployment Payment, Jobseeker's Allowance, Jobseeker's Benefit and other eligible payments for the purposes of meeting the 391 days eligibility requirement for the special rate of grant. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, a very important feature of the scheme that I would point to is the change of circumstances provision. If a student or party to their application experiences a change in circumstances that is not a temporary change and is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, they can apply to SUSI to have their application assessed under the change in circumstances provision of the relevant Student Grant Scheme. The income of all parties to the application will be assessed or reassessed on current income and applicants may also be asked to provide evidence of same. <\/p>  <p>  Such a change in circumstances includes no longer being in receipt of a pandemic unemployment payment. Students will no longer receive the PUP from early September, in line with normal circumstances where students do not qualify for unemployment payments while at college.<\/p>  <p>  The change of circumstances provision is a well-established procedure and it can also operate at scale.\u00a0 For example, over 10,000 applicants declared a change of circumstance in the 2020\/21 academic year and some 40% of these applications related to COVID-19. I am confident that the application of this provision will continue to allow the scheme to be flexible and responsive to people's circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Any student who believes his\/her student grant application has been assessed incorrectly may also avail of the opportunities to appeal to SUSI and subsequently to the independent Student Grants Appeals Board.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the Student Grant Scheme, students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the third level institution attended. This fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300093#WRAA04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":1387,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300093#WRAA04400"},{"type":"question","counter":1388,"qnumday":520,"qnumall":"[37422\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300093#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the supports and information made available to universities, colleges and other institutions and bodies under his remit to deal with suspected and confirmed cases of domestic abuse; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1525","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1389,"content":"<p>Tackling domestic and sexual abuse and providing supports for victims is a priority for Government.

My ambition is to ensure that we provide supports and opportunities for learning to all.\u00a0This means recognising the needs of vulnerable learners, the most marginalised and those with special and additional needs.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A range of supports and measures are in place for learners with disabilities; some of these supports are targeted while others are available to the general student populace. The main support available to students is the statutory based Student Grant Scheme. Under the terms of the Student Grant Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means. \u00a0Circa 75,000 students are supported annually under the fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Student Assistance Fund (SAF) provides financial assistance to students experiencing financial difficulties while attending higher education.\u00a0 Students can be assisted towards costs such as rent, childcare costs, transport costs and books\/class materials. Students on full or part-time courses leading to a higher education award in the universities, institutes of technology and other approved colleges can apply for the SAF. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.<\/p>  <p>  The Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) supports participation by students with a disability in further and higher education. The FSD is one of the main funding sources supporting participation by students with disabilities in approved further and higher education courses in Ireland. It also supports students from Ireland to study on approved courses in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries. The actual level of support to be provided to individual students is decided by each institution who carry out a needs assessment to determine the types of supports and accommodations needed. Circa 14,000 students are supported annually under the fund.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year\u00a0I\u00a0approved a number of strategic projects under the Fund for Students with Disabilities (FSD) aimed at supporting students with disabilities to access and engage with higher education. The initiatives, which involve 23 higher education institutions (HEI) and &euro;5.4m in expenditure, are broad and are aimed at improving access to higher education for people with a disability, to improving college campuses and to assist staff with training and development. Among the projects are a number of projects for students with autism including the establishment of autism friendly rooms across nine different campuses, the development of assistive technology including for students with disabilities, an app to help students with visual or hearing impairment navigate their way around campus and specialist assistance for students who are deaf.<\/p>  <p>  Circa &euro;40m is allocated annually to higher education institutions (HEIs), through their core funding, in recognition of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from National Access Plan target groups, including students with disabilities. This enables all HEIs to have an access infrastructure, including disability support services, in place that provides for the pre-entry and post-entry work required to support students from target groups to access and successfully complete higher education.<\/p>  <p>  Apart from the student grant and dedicated access supports,\u00a0the Deputy will be aware of the range of\u00a0additional supports\u00a0that were put in place for students as part\u00a0of Budget 2021 and\u00a0as part of the Government's\u00a0COVID response last year. These included: additional supports for access measures in higher education; a mitigating educational disadvantage fund for further education and training; a student laptop scheme; a once off grant of &euro;250 for students; additional funding for student mental health and wellbeing; and Dormant Accounts Funding for Traveller access to and progress within higher education.<\/p>  <p>  The National\u00a0Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2016-2021\u00a0(NAP) has set targets to increase participation in higher education by people with disabilities. Specific targets have been set to increase participation in higher education by students with physical or sensory disabilities. The original (8%) and revised target (12%) under the National Access Plan of new entrants to higher education with disabilities has now been exceeded, with 12.3% of new entrants to higher education in 2019\/20 declaring a disability.<\/p>  <p>  While there is significant provision for students with intellectual disabilities in the further education and training sector\u00a0where there were 2,821 learners with intellectual disabilities in 2019 and\u00a0some provision in the higher education sector involving a comparatively\u00a0small number of learners. I have asked my officials to engage with the HEA and SOLAS to see where we can play a stronger role, in meeting the educational needs of this group as part of a coherent whole of Government responses. We are at an early stage of work in this area, but it is an area I am strongly committed to pursuing.<\/p>  <p>  Fostering Inclusion is one of the three core pillars around which the Further Education and Training (FET) Strategy 2020-2024 is built. SOLAS, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), and the 16 ETBs across the country have progressed a series of actions to support the goal of Fostering Inclusion through the development and roll-out of a series of good practice guidelines to promote inclusion throughout FET, including for learners with a disability. This includes the development of a conceptual framework for Universal Design for Learning (UDL) for the FET Sector, which aims to reduce obstacles to learning by taking into account the needs of learners of diverse backgrounds and abilities. SOLAS are also working on finalising a report on &lsquo;Guidelines on Inclusion of People with Intellectual Disabilities in Adult Literacy Service&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The FET sector is committed to increasing levels of inclusion through the provision of high quality, more accessible and flexible education and training programmes and supports suited to the identified needs of individuals, including for learners with a disability. Supports in the FET sector for learners with a disability include access to the Fund for Students with a Disability (FSD), a wide range of reasonable accommodations depending on the learner&rsquo;s needs, the Adult Education Guidance Service (AEGS), as well as provision of specific programmes for learners with a disability who may require more intensive supports through Specialist Training Provision (STP).<\/p>  <p>  Ensuring that the apprenticeship population reflects the general population is a stated aim of the Government in both the Programme for Government and the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2021-2025.\u00a0 Targets for participation by under-represented groups, and additional specific actions to support those target groups will be set in conjunction with the Equity of Access Subcommittee (of the National Apprenticeship Alliance)\u00a0 and will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that interventions are working and that we are delivering greater diversity across the apprentice population.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep existing provision and initiatives under review. We want to develop a better understanding of what works best within the different models, and to look at how we can assist people to access and progress through higher and further education and training. Thus ensuring that we grow prosperity across communities and build social cohesion, while also recognising the different needs of learners and enabling each and every one of them to develop to their full potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Fees","counter":1438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1439,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[38055\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of reducing the third-level student contribution also known as the registration fee by &euro;500; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1440,"content":"<p>The\u00a0student contribution was introduced in higher education institutions with effect from the 2011\/12 academic year and replaced the\u00a0Student Services Charge.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While the student contribution now stands at &euro;3,000, it is important to recognise that there has been no increase in the student contribution charge since 2014\/15 and that currently in excess of 60,000 students have all or part of the student contribution paid on their behalf by the State via the Student Grant Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated net cost to the Exchequer if the student contribution charge was reduced by\u00a0&euro;500 in the academic year 2021\/2022 is c. &euro;40.9m.<\/p>  <p>  These\u00a0calculations are based on the number of students that qualified for free fees funding in the academic year 2019\/20, take into account overall projected increase in student numbers and factor\u00a0in the resulting estimated reduction to my department's Student Grant Scheme budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1624"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Education","counter":1441,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1442,"qnumday":538,"qnumall":"[38058\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB04000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the annual spend on the student maintenance grant; the estimated cost of increasing all rates by 10%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1624"},{"type":"question","counter":1443,"qnumday":539,"qnumall":"[38059\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300094#WRBB04100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the income thresholds for the student maintenance grant also known as the SUSI grant; the estimated cost of increasing all rates by 10%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":1444,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 538 and 539 together.<\/p>  <p>There are various income thresholds used depending on the type of grant, family size etc. While SUSI has statistics on those students who have applied for grant support and can estimate with some degree of certainty, what impact changes to the thresholds might have for those students on lower income levels, the accuracy of its estimates become less reliable at the higher income levels.

For the first time, it set out in statute what consent actually means - a free and voluntary agreement between people to engage in sexual activity.<\/p><p>The 2017 Act amended the Criminal Law (Rape) Amendment Act 1990, inter alia by setting out certain\u00a0circumstances where consent is impossible, such as when a person is asleep or unconscious; if they are being held captive; if they cannot communicate their agreement due to physical inability or disability; if they are mistaken or misled about who the other person is, or what the activity is; or for example if they are so drunk or intoxicated that they are in no position to consider the activity and make up their mind.\u00a0\u00a0The list is non-exhaustive, and the Act specifically states that the section concerned does not limit the circumstances in which it may be established that a person did not consent to a sexual act. Coercion other than the threat of physical force is a factor that may be considered when examining whether or not consent was given. <\/p><p>In order for a jury to find a person guilty of rape, three things are necessary.<ol type=\"1\"><li>Sexual intercourse must have taken place;<li>the\u00a0person must not have consented; and<li>the accused person must either have known that person didn&rsquo;t consent, or been reckless as to whether they consented or not.<\/ol>During the Oireachtas debate on the Bill, the issue of whether a person&rsquo;s belief in consent must be\u00a0reasonably\u00a0held was discussed in some detail. As the law stands, the mental element of the offence of rape is not present if the accused\u00a0honestly\u00a0believed consent was given, so long as that belief was genuine, no matter how unreasonable or irrational. As a result, a person who held a genuine but completely unreasonable belief that the other person consented\u00a0would not be found guilty of rape.\u00a0<\/p><p>It was on foot of those debates that\u00a0the Attorney General and one of my predecessors as Minister discussed the matter and agreed to refer it to the Law Reform Commission, for detailed consideration. The Commission produced a thorough and expert examination of the complex issue of consent and recommend a change in the law to state that the belief of the accused person in consent must be reasonably held.\u00a0It also touches on some of the surrounding matters which are being examined elsewhere, such as rape myths and stereotypes, obstacles to prosecution in rape cases, the treatment of victims in rape cases and other related matters.<\/p><p>The Deputy is also aware that my Department is\u00a0leading on the delivery of a number of important\u00a0commitments to make sure that we are responding effectively to the needs of victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence.

Other than in exceptional circumstances, the Act will require the intention to question a victim on their prior sexual history to be raised at a preliminary trial hearing, before the commencement of the trial.

The victim will also be entitled to legal aid for this purpose. The availability of a legal expert in their corner, should they wish, will be of great assistance and they will have someone whose only role in the case is to advise them.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Recommendation 5.5 of Supporting a Victim's Journey states that once notification has been given at a preliminary trial hearing of intention to apply for leave to question a victim at trial under the terms of section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981, the Legal Aid Board should be immediately informed. The Legal Aid Board, in turn, should endeavour to ensure that the victim is represented by counsel of a level of seniority similar to that of counsel representing the prosecution and defence.<\/p>  <p>  My Department sought\u00a0leave from\u00a0of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to make changes to the fee structure of the Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s Barrister&rsquo;s panel.\u00a0Having written to DPER in that regard in early November 2020, sanction was\u00a0given in early March for either a single Junior or Senior Counsel to support victims in connection with applications under section 3\/4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 in which they are entitled to separate legal representation and where they have been granted legal aid. <\/p>  <p>  Implementing\u00a0Supporting a Victim's Journey\u00a0in full will require a number of legislative changes, the first being the Criminal Procedure Act, discussed above.

The then Minister of State received many representations from a range of stakeholders at the time and these were extensively discussed and publicised.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Act modernises the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and will help the better promotion of local gaming and lottery activity held primarily for charitable and philanthropic purposes, and which are an important source of funding to sporting clubs and community organisations across the country.<\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Act amends the 1956 Act to provide for lotteries promoted under licence for charitable and philanthropic causes only (e.g. sports clubs, community groups, etc.). A licence, once issued by the District Court, remains valid for 12 months and the maximum prize remains at not more than &euro;360,000, if a lottery is held as a once off event in a year. This could apply to situations where sports clubs might raffle high value items, for example, properties. The maximum prize of &euro;360,000 was introduced to give legal certainty to the offering of one single prize. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Act is an interim reform measure pending the comprehensive reform of gambling.

Ireland's forests amount to over 770,000 hectares, or about 11% of the land area of Ireland. These forests comprise a wide variety of species from native broadleaves to commercial conifers. All trees contribute to providing important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, recreational access in public forests but also provide important renewable materials such as timber and wood products.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  According to\u00a0the Department's National Forest Inventory, approximately 71.2% of the forests in Ireland consist of conifer forests with broadleaves amounting to 28.2%. Conifer species provide the main material for the building of homes, providing renewable energy and support over 12,000 jobs. The national forest inventory (NFI) also finds that Sitka spruce is the main conifer species at 51%, with a range of other species also recorded. Sitka spruce has proved to be an excellent timber species and provides the majority of material for the sawmilling and panel board mills in Ireland and contributes to the sustainable economic functions of forests. However, diversification of species is important and the Department continues to provides a range of financial incentives to increase the amount of other conifers and broadleaves planted.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The Forestry Act 2014 and the regulation of afforestation and felling activities also supports the sustainable management of forests by creating new forests and replanting when forests are harvested. The balance between how much forests grow each year and how much is harvested is an important indicator of sustainable forest management.\u00a0 \u00a0Ireland's NFI demonstrates that the national forest estate is not harvesting more timber than the forest can produce.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is also committed to the sustainable management of forests and is a signatory to the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, known as Forest Europe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300098#WRFF05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1691,"content":"<p>Question No. 624 answered with Question No. 623.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Animal Welfare","counter":1693,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1694,"qnumday":625,"qnumall":"[37535\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG00300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to proposals to prohibit the practice of providing halal meat; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1695,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any proposals to prohibit the practice of providing halal meat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Racing Industry","counter":1696,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG00500"},{"type":"question","counter":1697,"qnumday":626,"qnumall":"[37548\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if he is satisfied that all aspects and clauses in relation to governance, oversight, compliance and due diligence have been met in respect of Horse Sport Ireland&rsquo;s interests in a site (details supplied); if he has ever sought this information or information pertaining to other serious corporate governance responsibilities such as those covered by clause 10 of the service level agreement that exists between Horse Sport Ireland and his Department; and if he is satisfied that the service level agreement that has been agreed on has been and is functioning as intended.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1698,"content":"<p>Horse Sport Ireland (HSI) is a company limited by guarantee.

The stock was subject to high harvest rates for more than four decades, and fisheries were not managed during this time.<\/p>  <p>  The species is a long-lived, slow growing and late maturing species and is, therefore, particularly vulnerable to over-fishing.  Conservation measures in recent years have reduced mortality significantly and stabilised the decline. The biomass (a measures of the quantity of the stock) of the species has started to increase slowly, however, the biomass remains extremely low and is below the biomass limit reference point established by ICES. <\/p>  <p>  The latest scientific advice issued by ICES on 2nd October 2020 is that there should be no targeted fisheries for dogfish in 2021 and 2022. On the basis of this advice, and as the EU manages fish stocks having regard for this advice, there appears currently no liklihood of re-introducing a targeted fishery in the period covered by this advice.<\/p>  <p>  While there is a very limited quota available for use only in pilot schemes designed to reduce by-catches, any such schemes are subject to European Commission approval and must relate to reducing by-catches of dogfish in other fisheries, i.e. the targeting of dogfish would remain prohibited. A scheme for dogfish avoidance was explored by the Marine Institute but, following consultation with the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), it was decided not to proceed further with a scheme taking into account how such a scheme would operate.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the proposal for cooperation between the Marine Institute and industry in conducting surveys on the abundance of spurdog around the coast, I will refer this request to the Marine Institute for consideration within its Irish Fisheries Science Research Partnership, involving industry representatives, Marine Institute and BIM, where research projects assessments and priorities are actively discussed.<\/p>  <p>  The monitoring and control of fishing vessels, including illegal catches of spurdog, within Ireland's Exclusive Fisheries Zone are matters for the Irish control authorities, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1703,"content":"<p>Question No. 628 answered with Question No. 627.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Food Safety","counter":1704,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1705,"qnumday":629,"qnumall":"[37641\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071300099#WRGG01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if all EU states are subject to the same food safety regime when it comes to exporting brown crab to the Chinese market.","asker":"1463","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1706,"content":"<p>China, as\u00a0a third country, outside of the European Union,\u00a0sets its own health standards for incoming food products and notifies the WTO of the standards in place.\u00a0I understand that the Chinese authorities have recently\u00a0held a consultation on the health standards that will apply for crab as a food product and I hope that the outcome of this\u00a0will bring some benefits\u00a0for trade in Irish crab products.\u00a0Ireland works closely with the EU Commission on the development of European positions on market access and food safety matters and the recent Chinese consultation was no exception.<\/p>  <p>  The Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) is an independent statutory body which has responsibility for seafood safety controls and the enforcement of seafood safety law.
