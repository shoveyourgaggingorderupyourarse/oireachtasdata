Committees are encouraged, however, to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online, through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to sanitise and to wash their hands properly and often, and to avail of sanitiser outside and inside committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members are well aware that if they are participating in the meeting remotely, they are required to do so from within the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Bruton.<\/p> <p>  The main item for discussion today is the waiver of intellectual property protection in the context of the World Trade Organization agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, as it relates to Covid-19 vaccines.  The TRIPS agreement is an international legal agreement between all member nations of the World Trade Organization, WTO, and any proposal for a potential variation or waiver of the current intellectual property protections under the TRIPS agreement is for negotiation at the WTO, of which Ireland is one of 164 members.  Furthermore, at EU level, international trade is an EU competence such that the EU, as a single voice, represents the co-ordinated position of the 27 member states, including in discussions on TRIPS at the WTO.  Universal and equitable access to vaccines is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that the committee has an opportunity to discuss this matter further with a number of representatives from the following organisations.  I welcome the following: from Oxfam Ireland, Mr. Jim Clarken, chief executive; from Maynooth University's department of law, Professor Aisling McMahon; from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Mr. Dimitri Eynikel, access campaign EU policy adviser; from St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dr. Christine Kelly; from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, Mr. Oliver O'Connor, chief executive; and from BioPharmaChem Ireland, Mr. Matt Moran, director, and Ms Nessa Fennelly, senior executive.<\/p> <p>  Before we start our discussion, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. Jim Clarken and Professor Aisling McMahon to make their opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#A00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":6,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to brief them on the TRIPS waiver as it relates to the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am Jim Clarken, CEO of Oxfam Ireland, also representing the People's Vaccine Alliance Ireland.  Oxfam is a development, humanitarian and human rights organisation working across 66 countries to end inequality and poverty.  The People's Vaccine Alliance Ireland is made up of NGOs, health practitioners across the medical profession, trade unions, academics and faith groups.<br\/><br\/>We are over two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and huge levels of vaccine inequity persist.  Just 13% of people in low-income countries have received two doses, compared with 75% of people in high-income countries.  Less than 1% of people in low-income countries are boosted, compared with over 60% of people here in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>To address this and to prepare for future pandemics effectively, we need diversity of production and supply.  Multiple producers should be able to produce vaccines in sufficient quantity and to adapt them to new variants and needs.  A TRIPS waiver will help to achieve this.<br\/><br\/>An example of this potential is the WHO mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa, which has the potential to lead and to inform the development of mRNA technology in Africa.  However, this may be hampered without a TRIPS waiver.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, Covid-19 therapeutics remain &quot;out of reach of the poor&quot; without a TRIPS waiver, according to the WHO director general, Dr. Tedros, last week.  This is particularly egregious given that those who are unvaccinated are those who would benefit most from therapeutics.<br\/><br\/>Not having control over vaccine and therapeutic production means that low-income countries continue to experience the same devastation we experienced before vaccine roll-out, even though the tools to prevent this are out there.  As Wilfred Gurupira, an academic in Zimbabwe recently interviewed by Oxfam, put it:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt's one thing losing those you love to a pandemic where there's nothing that can be done.  But it's quite another, losing people when you know there was something that could be done to help them, but you can't access it. <\/blockquote> <p>The lack of access to vaccines and therapeutics is translating into huge numbers of deaths.  Since the start of the pandemic, <i>The Economist<\/i>estimates that 19.5 million people have died and over 3 million Covid-19 deaths have occurred since the Omicron variant emerged.  The majority of all those deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.<br\/><br\/>Arguments have been made that enough vaccines are coming online to address this issue.  Experts have estimated that there will be a 15 billion dose shortfall in mRNA Covid vaccine production in 2022.  mRNA vaccines have the highest reported effectiveness against Omicron.  This gap is likely to increase due to the need for boosters, especially variant-specific boosters.  We cannot expect developing countries to fight today's virus with yesterday's tools.<br\/><br\/>A TRIPS waiver would not just prevent large levels of mortality and morbidity in low-income countries; it could also help to prevent the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants that have the potential to drag Ireland, this part of the world and the whole world into lockdowns and restrictions again.<br\/><br\/>Allowing generic production worked before during the HIV-AIDS epidemic, although millions of lives were lost before such production was allowed.  I urge the committee not to allow a similar outcome to arise by continuing to delay a TRIPS waiver, which would create a similar level of suffering and damage.<\/p><p>Ireland's continued opposition to the TRIPS waiver is in contravention of Ireland&rsquo;s human rights obligations and is greatly damaging Ireland&rsquo;s hard-earned international reputation as a champion of low-income countries and human rights.  The need for Ireland&rsquo;s support of the TRIPS waiver is pressing, as the WTO ministerial conference will be held in June.  Low-income countries cannot wait any longer.  The TRIPS waiver is supported by more than 100 countries, the WHO, the Seanad and the majority of the Irish public.  It is time Ireland supported the TRIPS waiver, helped to save millions of lives and helped to put an end to this pandemic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Clarken","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this invitation to address the committee today.  I am a professor of law in Maynooth University specialising in intellectual property, IP, and health law.<br\/><br\/>IP rights, such as patents, provide rights holders with an exclusive right over the patented technology for a limited period, which is generally 20 years for patents.  If the patented technology is an element of a vaccine, rights holders can control who can access that vaccine and at what price, and who can use that element to produce similar vaccines.  Accordingly, how IP rights are used is a key factor affecting access to Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and diagnostics.<br\/><br\/>The TRIPS agreement is an international WTO agreement which imposes minimum IP obligations that must be offered in all WTO states.  Due to concerns about the effects of IP on access to Covid-19 health technologies and, in particular, concerns that low- and middle-income countries were highly likely to fall significantly behind high-income countries in securing access to such technologies, in October 2020 India and South Africa proposed the TRIPS waiver.  This proposal was made and discussed against the backdrop of a lack of sufficient industry support for voluntary global initiatives to encourage the sharing of IP data and know-how to radically upscale Covid-19 vaccine production for global needs.<br\/><br\/>The waiver proposes to temporarily suspend certain IP obligations under TRIPS for Covid-19 health technologies.  If it is adopted, it will suspend WTO states' obligations at the international TRIPS level.  However, states like Ireland could likely maintain IP protections at a national level if they wished.  The main likely effect of the waiver would be to allow low- and middle-income countries to avail of it, thereby enabling entities within such countries to produce similar Covid-19 vaccines, medicines or diagnostics without facing IP litigation.  While this waiver is not a panacea, it would, nonetheless, clear IP hurdles and act as a key step in increasing global vaccine production.  More specifically, it would be a key step to enable low- and middle-income countries to develop sustainable long-term solutions to vaccine supply issues where the <i>status quo<\/i>model under TRIPS has simply failed such countries.  In doing so, it would help to build resilience for future pandemic preparedness.  However, no agreement has been reached on the waiver to date, and the EU is a key blocker of the original TRIPS waiver proposal.  Most recently, it has been reported that the EU is supporting a so-called quad - comprising the EU, India, South Africa and the US - outcome text proposal.  This proposal arose following informal discussions among the US, India, South Africa and the EU.  However, it is not clear at this point if India, South Africa or the US support the text.<br\/><br\/>In my view, this quad proposal, in its current form, does not offer a useful pathway to upscale Covid-19 vaccine production for four main reasons.  First, it applies primarily to patents, not other IP rights such as trade secrets, which are also vital for vaccine production.  It falls far short of the broad package of measures envisaged by the original TRIPS waiver.  Second, unlike the original TRIPS waiver, this proposal does not waive IP rights, as such.  Instead, it primarily makes modifications to existing TRIPS compulsory licensing mechanisms.  Compulsory licensing can be useful in some contexts but it, alone, is not an effective tool to address vaccine access issues during a global health crisis.  Third, the quad proposal introduces various additional requirements for compulsory licensing other than what TRIPS requires.  For example, it requires a list of all patents relevant to the vaccine before a compulsory licence is issued.  This could prove exceptionally difficult in practice.  Fourth, this proposal only applies to eligible members and this is narrowly defined, thereby limiting who can use it.  Put simply, the quad proposal in its current form is not a workable or effective solution for Covid-19 vaccine access issues.  For these reasons, states such as Ireland should advocate at an EU level and internationally in support of the measures set out in the original TRIPS waiver proposal and work to actively achieve such measures in a waiver text under the current WTO negotiations.

The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and BioPharmaChem Ireland, BPCI, are here jointly as the representative organisations for the research-based biopharmaceutical industry in Ireland.  Our remarks are set against a backdrop of very low Covid-19 case numbers in Ireland, high rates of vaccination and avoided mortality and serious illness from the disease.  It is more than 16 months since Annie Lynch, the 79-year-old Dubliner, became the first person in Ireland to be vaccinated for Covid-19.  Since then, almost 11 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.  More than 4 million people are fully protected against the disease through vaccination.<\/p> <p>  The efficient roll-out of the vaccination programme here attests strongly to the capacity of the Department of Health and the HSE to respond to an emergency.  The biopharmaceutical industry, the work of which, along with others, led to the discovery, development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments in record time, is proud of our achievement too.  We are aware that there is more to be done.  While Ireland has a world-class Covid-19 vaccination rate, much of the world remains unprotected.  That must change.  We are as committed to this as any other party.  We want as many people as possible, regardless of where they live, vaccinated for Covid-19 as fast as possible.  The response to this pandemic, to future ones and to all other diseases depends on stable conditions for the discovery, development and production of vaccines and treatments.  Speed of delivery and global equity of access to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and the protection of IP rights, are not mutually exclusive.  They are complementary. <\/p> <p>  To thrive, innovation depends on IP protection.  It is the certainty that shields the risky business of investing in research and development.  Most of this fails.  The global patents system is the basis for innovation.  The proposed TRIPS waiver is a serious risk to the global patents system.  Waiving IP rights will not accelerate global Covid-19 vaccines access.  Production is not now the problem and has not been.  There are already more than enough vaccines for the world.  The problem is they are not getting to the people who most need them fast enough.<\/p> <p>  The effort to vaccinate the world for Covid-19 is limited by vaccine administration, not by vaccine production.  By the end of June, 16.3 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines will have been produced since the start of the pandemic.  At the end of January, there were more than 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses produced, including 3.4 billion mRNA vaccines.  Of the 12 billion, 10 billion were administered.  The speed of Covid-19 vaccines production is outpacing their administration globally.<\/p> <p>  The cause of global Covid-19 vaccine inequity is the capacity of some countries, mostly developing countries, to absorb, distribute and administer the doses they get.  In some of these countries, Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy is high.  There are reports of shortages of syringes and medical equipment, as well as the destruction of significant quantities of doses of expired vaccines.  Clearly, this is not to blame countries for shortcomings and for their great challenges and difficulties.  Rather, it is a signal to us to do more to help in this area of vaccine administration.  In essence, the problem is not vaccines, it is vaccination.<\/p> <p>  By the end of last month, COVAX, Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, the vaccine distribution programme backed by the WHO, had delivered 1.43 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses to 145 countries.  Africa has received around 672 million doses.  In January, 96 million doses were shipped to Africa, which is more than double the number shipped six months before that.  However, COVAX is now only shipping Covid-19 vaccines to countries on demand to ensure the right volume at the right time.  The WHO has reported that up to 3.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have had to be destroyed. <\/p> <p>  Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, whom we all know, has indicated that global vaccines access is affected now more by demand-side challenges than by supply-side ones.  Most recently, on 22 April, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention asked for all Covid-19 vaccine donations to be paused until later this year because hesitancy and logistical hurdles are hampering administration.<\/p> <p>  Our industry has met the challenge of global production by investing in existing sites and voluntarily entering into over 370 licensing and other agreements with manufacturing partners with the skills and technology needed to produce Covid-19 vaccines to the highest regulatory standards.  Further production capacity expansions are planned, especially in Africa.  For Covid-19 treatments, over 150 voluntary partnerships are in play.<\/p> <p>  Often, global supply of vaccines and medicines is managed from a small number of manufacturing sites, with production of the drug substance, known as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, concentrated in one site.  Building manufacturing sites across multiple continents is impractical and unnecessary.<\/p><p>Importing and exporting raw ingredients is complex.  Early in the pandemic, that process was exacerbated by trade barriers, such as export restrictions.  For one mRNA vaccine, there are some 280 raw ingredients.  Local regulatory approval is needed where manufacturing sites are located.  The right skills are not always available locally.  Until 2020, there was no mRNA vaccine manufacturing anywhere in the world.<\/p><p> Waiving intellectual property rights for use in manufacturing sites with very limited capacity, or to be made available to companies with no track record or experience in manufacturing complex medicines such as vaccines, could result in the diversion and hoarding of critical raw materials and the weakening of already strained supply chains.  That could lead to fewer, inferior or even unsafe vaccines.<\/p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Matt Moran, from BioPharmaChem Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us.  Following on from Mr. O'Connor, I will continue our contribution.<\/p> <p>  A draft proposal released in March by the WTO puts forward a limited waiver or modified compulsory licensing provisions for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.  We consider these proposals as serious risks to global public health.  Voluntary production partnerships have been shown to work, as Mr. O'Connor outlined.  We must avoid dampening research and development, which would damage health outcomes, as well as potentially costing jobs in locations where there is significant biopharmaceutical investment.  Members are all aware of the important role of that investment in the Irish economy.<\/p> <p>  According to the European Patent Office, a waiver would lead to a 37% drop in research and development for Covid-19-related products, such as vaccines and therapeutic treatments.  The impact would disproportionately be felt in higher income countries where research and development activity is more likely to be concentrated.<\/p> <p>  Multilateral solutions are needed to strengthen healthcare system capacity for Covid-19 vaccine administration and to empathetically tackle vaccine hesitancy.  Efforts must focus on developing economies.  Two thirds of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty are in middle-income countries.  Lower and upper middle-income countries are home to 75% of the world&rsquo;s population and 62% of the world&rsquo;s poor.  A collaborative effort to protect vulnerable populations against Covid-19 must involve a co-ordinated effort between industry, the global health community, governments and non-government organisations to help bridge gaps in cold chain and service delivery, insufficient workforce capacity and challenges with demand and vaccine confidence in some countries.  These challenges should not be underestimated.  The challenge of making and distributing pharmaceuticals is significant and complex.<\/p> <p>  Our industry is part of the effort to achieve global vaccines equity.  We believe there are six ways to achieve that goal.  These are to continue to surge production of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments through in-company investments in sites and voluntary on-boarding of suitable manufacturing partners; eliminate trade barriers so that the free flow of vaccines, ingredients and medical goods and supplies across borders is facilitated in the global supply chain; increase dose-sharing, with developed countries giving developing countries much more of their surplus vaccine doses faster; support country readiness, building the capacity of healthcare systems in developing countries to efficiently absorb, distribute and administer vaccine doses; combat vaccine hesitancy through education and health awareness programmes, empathetic and tailored community outreach and influencer activations in mainstream media and on social media platforms; and drive further innovation in vaccines and treatments and work with healthcare systems on planning to guard against variants of concern and future pandemics.<\/p> <p>  We cannot afford to undermine innovation.  Scientists expect more zoonotic contagion in the future, making IP rights a key part of the public health response.  We still have to find answers to the diseases we do not know about.  Globally, there are thousands of medicines in development.  Among them are cell and gene therapies to treat, prevent and potentially cure some diseases such as cancer.  This is the dividend of innovation.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has been harrowing, causing sickness and death for so many people.  According to the latest estimates, over 15 million people have died globally and there have been 13% more deaths than are normally expected over two years.  However, without vaccines and later treatments, the death toll and lost economic output caused by Covid-19 would have been so much worse.<\/p> <p>  This is our industry's contribution to the world - saving lives, guarding against severe illness and maintaining economic life.  We are proud of that contribution, made possible by science.  Let us protect it for the health of all of us and for economic progress.

He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tWe are over two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and huge levels of vaccine inequity persist.  Just 13% of people in low-income countries have received two doses, compared with 75% of people in high-income countries.

We all believe, I am sure, that nobody is safe until everybody is safe.  We keep saying that but we need to give that some meaning.  If we say nobody is safe until everybody is safe, it has to have some substance.<\/p><p>I have done a small amount of reading on this.  From what I can see, people with much more knowledge of IP law than I have argue that a TRIPS waiver is necessary and proportion.  It clears the IP barriers and facilitates increased supply and development of technologies, etc.<\/p><p>Given the figures I have outlined and the evidence given by Professor McMahon on the protection of income, will Mr. O'Connor explain how a TRIPS waiver would be detrimental to innovation, particularly given that a TRIPS waiver was not detrimental to innovation when the generic production of HIV-AIDS drugs was finally allowed?  Mr. O'Connor seems to be suggesting that there is some sort of an administrative problem and that the problem is not vaccines but vaccinations.  I believe it is a little more complicated than that.  I ask Mr. O'Connor to outline how the TRIPS waiver would be detrimental to innovation given that the evidence available in relation to HIV-AIDS drugs suggests it would not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#C00400","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>On the first point, the situation we are at today in which there are more vaccines available than the African countries are ready and capable of accepting shows that the IP rights have not been the barrier to the production of sufficient vaccines to be administered in Africa at this time.<\/p> <p>  To go to the point about whether the TRIPS waiver would harm innovation, we have evidence on this which we can send to the committee afterwards.  The study by the European Patent Office showed that a waiver would lead to a 37% drop in investment in research and development for vaccines and therapeutics and that this effect would be felt in both developing and developed countries.  The reason is that vaccines, like medicines, are created, funded and researched by capital that comes from both the public and the private sectors, but predominantly the private sector.  Any uncertainty in what are the rules of the game in advance will have a dampening effect on the willingness or ability of companies to raise funds for investment in very risky research.  One has to look right back to the earliest part of the process of the development of vaccines and therapies to see that this is where the investment in Europe of &euro;35 billion a year by the pharmaceutical industry happens.  It is not sufficient to look at it simply at the point where there is production of the vaccine and all the manufacturing processes that are protected by intellectual property rights.  It is not sufficient only to look at a certain point that they are actually developed.  One has to look right back to the start to see how does the investment in risky research happen.  Creating an uncertainty about the outcome at the end point has a dampening effect on the ability to raise funds to invest in risky ventures, especially where many of the results do not come through.  That is the fundamental economic point here about how vaccines and medicines actually get developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

We both work on the Covid-19 response, particularly in peaks of the pandemic and here and there with the roll-out of vaccines.  We also work on access to treatments, which we have not talked about but which I hope we can get back to, in addition to vaccines and diagnostics.<\/p> <p>  On the research and development cost, I disagree a little with the position that has been presented.  It is true that the research and development of vaccines is risky and takes much investment.  There is a big chance of failure; however, exactly for that reason; we have seen very little investment by the industry in vaccine development in recent decades, except when there were major outbreaks.  When there were outbreaks, there was significant public funding.  This happened with Ebola.  We can see a very similar situation now with the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was known that coronaviruses posed a serious threat of pandemic and epidemic outbreaks but there was very little investment.  When the outbreak came, significant funding was made available and advance-purchase agreements were signed, etc.  That is what created the enabling conditions.  The intellectual property rights existed before the outbreak.  There could have been investments in that regard but they did not happen.

It is not about the abolition of intellectual property rights across the board.  The waiver of intellectual property rights is a temporary one that countries can use for a few years.  It will not harm intellectual property rights in Europe or in the US, for example.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dimitri Eynikel"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I agree.  I wish to elaborate on what Mr. Eynikel has mentioned.  I am actually one of the authors of the paper mentioned.  Together with colleagues in the London School of Economics, University of Leeds and University of Kent, we argue that the intellectual property waiver proposed was a necessary and proportionate step in 2020 and 2021 and still is now, for various reasons.  In the paper, which was supported by over 200 intellectual-property academics all over the world in an open letter, we highlight that innovation is one of the arguments that is often presented but that when one digs deeper into those details, one notes those arguments could be questioned, particularly in the vaccine context.<\/p> <p>  First, as Mr. Eynikel has mentioned, intellectual property rights traditionally have been recognised as a very poor incentive for vaccine manufacture, for several reasons on which I will be happy to expand.  In the past, as Mr. Eynikel has highlighted in some examples, we have not had vaccines even though we knew a disease was likely.  There can be a risk of disease but not necessarily a guaranteed market.  In the Covid-19 context, it is important to state there has been very significant public funding, which is very good, and incredible scientific research, which should be acknowledged as excellent.   On top of that, however, public funding, advance-purchase agreements and other factors de-risked the production of Covid-19 vaccines.  The reality is that if we maintain intellectual property rights without recourse to any interventions for low- and middle-income countries, vaccines will be distributed not necessarily on the basis of health need, as we saw in 2020 and 2021, but rather on the basis of deals done between holders of intellectual property rights and countries that may have more money to facilitate access.  Low- and middle-income countries are those that are most likely to suffer, as pointed out.  At the moment, we may have more supplies but the situation is in flux because we could face a new variant at any moment or, indeed, a new pandemic.  If we do, low- and middle-income countries will not have the capacity built up, which is what they are asking for.<\/p> <p>  It is important to state that while there may be some supplies of vaccines going to low- and middle-income countries, they do not have a sustainable supply.  Many of those countries are asking to be able to have technology-transfer-related intellectual-property waivers so they can produce their own supply of vaccines, as we in Ireland and others have done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>On that, Mr. O'Connor says the skills and ingredients might not be available locally and that certain amounts of product are being destroyed because the capability does not exist.

We know that is the case in several countries.  We also know that, for example, Afrigen, together with the WHO hub, has recently replicated in South Africa a vaccine similar to the Moderna vaccine.  Therefore, we know there are skills there.  We also know that over 100 companies are willing to try to manufacture mRNA vaccines.  We know the skills exist.  The literature points not to Mr. O'Connor's conclusion but to the conclusion that entities are willing and have the skills to produce vaccines if intellectual property rights are waived and if there is a transfer of know-how and technology.

We have to recognise there are challenges.  They are predictable.  While I agree there are challenges associated with administering vaccines in certain countries and support is needed, let us not whitewash what has happened.  The vaccine inequity that we see today is largely the result of what happened last year, whereby very few vaccines were available for most of the world.  Eighty percent of the world's population live in low- or middle-income countries.  There were very few supplies available.  That is the problem we are addressing here today.  It is, of course, related to intellectual property rights and trade issues.  There was a large concentration of production in a few countries, including the US, European states and India.  The countries that could produce had priority access whereas those that could not did not have access to these tools.  They had no other source of supply.  That is the problem we are discussing here today.  We need diversity of production and supply so there will be multiple producers from which countries can source their vaccines now and in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dimitri Eynikel"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I might be able to pick up on some of those points.  The first point, on innovation, is really important.  I am an infectious-diseases physician and also work in academia.  My job is really to prescribe pharmaceutical interventions to people every day, so I understand the key role of research and development and innovation in driving forward patient health.  On that point, I agree with my colleagues from the pharmaceutical industry.  However, a pandemic presents a very different scenario, for two reasons.  First, an infection, by nature, is transmissible from person to person.  An intervention will potentially interrupt transmission chains, which makes it different.  Second, when there is a pandemic, you are not dealing with one specific country but with the entire global population.  You eventually get to the point where if you are protecting your patent to drive profits for further innovation, the innovation you are protecting will not be capable of being used for certain populations.  The key issue I have with the current model is that we have got to the point where the innovation falls into this category in respect of certain populations of people.  That is bad for medical ethics, interrupting transmission and public health.  There has to be a balance.  There has to be a point at which we say enough is enough and that we now need to regulate what happens in terms of protecting the patents and making sure the product is available to everybody who needs it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Christine Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I am very conscious that Mr. O'Connor has not had a chance to respond.

Let me respond to a couple of points.  On the question of the African production of vaccines, it is best to refer members to something I read recently, the African Union's plan entitled \"Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing\".  It sets a target for Africa to be able to manufacture 60% of its needed vaccines by 2040.  Its target is to be able to manufacture 10% of its needed vaccines on the African Continent by the end of 2025.<\/p><p>It does not include a requirement to achieve this to have a TRIPS waiver.  It is a very sophisticated document and it alerts to the importance of regulatory and standards controls and, indeed, the building of the skill sets needed within Africa.  It is an important report that would be worth looking at in this context.<\/p><p> On the overall issue of the economics of this, it is an unavoidable issue.  We are asking for private as well as public capital to be raised and it is up to the public sector rule-makers - the legislators - to say what are the rules.  We want to have a rules-based international system both for the production and the development of vaccines and medicines.  To go back, the initial TRIPS was set in the Doha round of trade talks and it allowed for compulsory licensing and so on.  Companies invested in their capacities and in their research and development on the basis of the rules that were in place.  If we now say those rules are not applied because we are going to have a waiver for vaccines, that changes the rule set.  For example, the Chinese want to manufacture mRNA vaccines and they are unhappy with the Quad proposal because they would not be currently allowed, and so on.<\/p><p> The fundamental point about investment is that the rules are set in advance.  Companies are raising capital, and the public sector is raising capital too, on the basis of the rules as set in advance.  If we change them, and it is open to the public sector to do that, we have to calculate the effects of that for future investment.  No company is forced to invest in any circumstances and no company can magic up the capital to invest both in its production capacity and in vaccines and medicines research and development.  They can only do so within the context of set international order and set rules.  It is a very important thing to ask whether we are changing those rules fundamentally and what effect that might have.  As I said, the European Patent Office said there will be a 37% reduction in vaccines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#D00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I am over time.

I find it difficult to see this point applying in this case.  The estimate I saw was that governments had spent more than &euro;90 billion on vaccines and therapeutics.  Is it not disingenuous for pharmaceutical companies to accept in excess of &euro;90 billion from countries across the globe to fund the vast majority of vaccine development and then say innovation is risky so we cannot have a waiver?

That is the balance, and how that is divided up is the constant job of the payment and investment in medicines and vaccines generally.<\/p> <p>  I would say that, in this case, the value generated by vaccines incalculably outstrips both the value for money investment the public sector has made and the value that is earned by companies.  Even within our own economy, we can see that.  We have a domestic economy of some &euro;240 billion or &euro;250 billion.  If we have a 1%, or 10%, or some other level of fall in that economic output, that vastly exceeds what Ireland would have invested in any part of the European investment in research and development and, indeed, paying for the medicines.  In the balance of who gets the benefit globally, it is society that is getting the huge benefit from all of the excellent investment that has been made by the public sector.

Normally, what the pharmaceutical industry does and has done is enter into licensing agreements and technology transfer agreements to ensure the capability is present and that they are able to manufacture these products and the ingredients.  To underestimate the complexity of what is happening here is a bit of a risk.  For instance, to make an mRNA vaccine that is made currently by Pfizer-BioNTech requires in excess of 280 different components, 46 different countries need to supply ingredients and there has to be a laboratory that can conduct more than 50 tests on the product.  The capability is not necessarily there.  The risk is that if one asks a company that does not have the capability to engage in manufacturing and supply, one is risking diversion of raw materials away from manufacturing and risking producing products which might be substandard, which is a risk to society and health.<\/p> <p>  The answer really is that, yes, the industry is keen to enter into joint agreements on a voluntary basis, which it has done and there are in excess of 350, as Mr. O'Connor referred to in his presentation.  They scour the world all of the time for new arrangements and, recently, joint licensing agreements have been agreed on the African continent between major pharmaceutical companies and local suppliers, and they will continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  Again, to put this in context, to establish a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant takes approximately two to three years in terms of the capital investment required, the regulatory approval required, the validation required and the training of people.  It is not something that is easily accessible.  I would congratulate the organisation Mr. O'Connor refers to with regard to establishing manufacturing on the African continent because it needs to be done, but it is not something that is going to happen overnight.  It is an area where we need to be very careful in terms of how we manage and deal with it.  The industry is keen to do this and has been doing this, and the evidence of that is the number of joint licensing agreements achieved.  Indeed, the committee is probably aware of the significant amount of vaccine that has been manufactured in India by the Serum Institute through an agreement it has with AstraZeneca.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#E00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Matt Moran"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":34,"content":"<p>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s agreement with the Serum Institute is the odd one out, to be honest, and is a bit of an exception.<\/p><p>We appreciate, of course, that the Serum Institute did share the technology.  There is a major difference between conventional vaccines, the different types of vaccines that existed before, and the mRNA vaccines.  The latter vaccines are largely synthetic vaccines and that means they are less complex to produce.  In opposition to what has just been said, they can be produced by many pharmaceutical companies that normally produce medicines, because these vaccines are simpler to produce.  Equally, the production process is closer to that of certain medicines.  In that regard, I disagree with what was said.<\/p><p> It is correct that there are some 300 agreements.  I am sure they exist, but to a large extent these are agreements with companies in the US and Europe, or they concern fill and finish deals.  These types of deals mean the vaccine substance is produced in the US or Europe and then shipped to some companies in Africa, for example, where the vaccine is just put in the vials and quality tests are done.  It is a valuable part of the production and supply chain, but it is not vaccine production.  It does not provide an alternative source of supply.  We have seen that, for example, in the context of the agreement between Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Biovac in South Africa, where the vials were filled in that country but then shipped back to Europe.  It means that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson were still selling these doses that were filled in South Africa back to Europe.  Such a process does not provide any solution for African countries seeking to buy access to vaccines.  A full production process is needed and we have not seen any commitment in this regard to share the requisite technology widely across the world.  This is why companies in India, Indonesia, Thailand and South Africa have been successfully re-engineering and developing mRNA vaccines themselves.

Two years ago, there were no vaccines.

She had waited 18 months for her Irish citizenship to come through and her Irish passport finally arrived this week.  She can now go back to South Africa and visit the grave of her son, who died in the early stages of Covid-19 because he did not have access to a vaccine.

A good point has been made regarding the human cost of this.  Mr. Clarken referred in his opening statement to how bad the scenario is regarding global vaccination now.  Many countries still have vaccination rates of less than 10%.  WHO guidance is that 10% of a country's population must be vaccinated to cover the most vulnerable people.  These are people we started vaccinating here in Ireland in December 2020.  We are talking about healthcare workers, elderly people and immunosuppressed people.  Those categories of people still have not had any vaccine administered in some countries around the world.  This hits me particularly hard, because as a healthcare worker, I understand how difficult it is to grapple with these issues of going in to treat people when you have not been vaccinated yourself and of watching people potentially getting very sick and dying from a vaccine-preventable disease.  I am grateful for that context having been brought in because this is the key aspect we must remember.<\/p> <p>  We now have enough production and things like that, but it is important to note, however, that this delay in rolling out vaccines has already had a major impact.  It is fair to say we have failed in global vaccine roll-out.  Large parts of the world have not received any vaccines at all.  The consequences of this are increased disease and death from a vaccine-preventable disease, increased transmission and prolongation of the pandemic.  Also worrying for me is our global health security, our ability to manage infections and prevent new infections and new variants, should they crop up.  All of this has been impacted by the delay.  It is not okay to sit here and state we had a very good programme in Ireland and we now have lots of production, because we are missing out on that crucial time when we missed doing this properly.  It is important for us to understand the impact this has had.  It has had an impact not only from a clinical point of view but also from a point of view of confidence in vaccine programmes.  Therefore, if we are talking about hesitancy and things like that, much of that has been driven by the fact there has been unreliable vaccine supply for a long time.  People were worried that some of the vaccines were expired.  Some had to be destroyed.

For every life lost in a rich country, four have been lost in a poor country.  People in poorer countries are much more likely to die from this disease than those of us lucky enough to have had the opportunity to be vaccinated.  Every minute, four children lose a parent or caregiver as a result of the pandemic.

An excellent paper was published in<i>Nature<\/i>last year that showed vaccine hesitancy rates in Africa and other low-income countries, apart from those in Africa, were similar overall to higher-income countries.  The problem we have is that the current distribution model is based on giving surplus supplies to these countries.

They are dealing with what they believe to be leftover vaccines from other countries, so that actually fuels vaccine hesitancy.  Because of vaccine inequity, we have made vaccine hesitancy worse.

In particular, it is very important to note that the Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence previously considered, was an initiative set up by the WHO to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, IP, etc., to upscale vaccine and other health technology production for Covid-19.  That initiative was one with great promise.  It was the idea that industry and states would come together in solidarity.  The reality is that industry did not sufficiently support that for vaccines at any stage.  It was precisely because of that lack of voluntary support for these types of global initiatives that India and South Africa had well-founded fears, sadly, that low- and middle-income countries would fall behind.  In an ideal world, voluntary agreements would have been the solution if there was sufficient engagement at that stage, but there was not.<\/p><p> The TRIPS waiver was proposed and has arguably been a leverage to encourage voluntary agreements.  Of those that have happened, we cannot prove that the waiver was definitely what led to them, but certainly waivers and compulsory licensing have been used as leverage in the past.  As Mr. Eynikel pointed out previously, many of the voluntary agreements, which are good to have and it has to be commended when such agreements are set up, are fill-and-finish agreements, which means the technology, the know-how, is not necessarily being transferred.  The issue with that is we are not building long-term capacity in low- and middle-income countries.<\/p><p> COVAX has been mentioned.  While it is a good system for short-term supply, COVAX does not allow countries to upscale their own manufacturing capacity, which is also a real issue.  It is the same with some of these voluntary initiatives.

The issue of China is not at all a serious concern for us in that respect.

As of December 2021, only 27% of healthcare workers on the African continent had been fully vaccinated.  The public money invested in vaccine development is estimated at approximately &euro;93 billion.  In December 2021, the Seanad passed a motion calling on the Government to publicly support and lobby the European Commission to support a TRIPS waiver.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the innovation of vaccines, is it not the case that public and political concern and public funding was key to the innovation of Covid-19 vaccines?  If that was the driving force, where is the public benefit of it globally?  Legal and IP scholars have argued that the TRIPS waiver is a necessary and proportionate legal measure for clearing IP barriers to facilitate increased supply of Covid-19 vaccines and other health technologies.  In these circumstances, is it not the case that high-income countries will continue to be markets for innovation regardless of the TRIPS waiver?  Is it not also the case that innovation of HIV-AIDS drugs continued after generic production was allowed in low-income countries?<\/p> <p>  It is not as if we have not been very successful, thanks to big pharma, governments and public funding.  We all know what happened with the HIV and AIDS epidemic.  The pharmaceutical industry rolled out similar talking points to the ones the witnesses have been providing today, but allowing generic production of HIV-AIDS medicines was what it took to get increased production, lower prices and millions of lives saved.  On a very simple scale, looking at what we did around AIDS in terms of what big pharma and public funding did, I do not understand why we are not doing the same here.<\/p> <p>  Vaccine manufacturing projections include vaccines that are not as effective as mRNA vaccines.  Why should low-income countries accept vaccines with lower effectiveness when the people of Ireland are no longer using them?  I was kind of on the fence about this a while back but I trust Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam and Amnesty Ireland.  These are organisations that are work with developing countries all the time.  Big pharma does not do so, and nor do I.  I trust these organisations.  If they are asking for this, maybe it is time we listened.  Maybe we and big pharma do not know best.  It is brilliant that the pharmaceutical companies came up with the vaccines, thanks to public funding, and rolled them out successfully in some countries.  However, can we put our hands on our hearts and say we are doing right by everybody globally?  It is very unfair.  There is already such a struggle for clean water and to meet basic human rights.

Our industry is doing everything it can, as evidenced by the production, to deliver that.  Our fundamental point remains, that a change to the TRIPS waiver is a change to the rules set up after the discussions on HIV.  It changes the rules to IP protections.  In some people's eyes, it would change the rules for everything, including production processes, the formula for the vaccine, therapeutics and so on.

The TRIPS agreement was adopted in 1995.  It is a WTO framework that sets out minimum standards.  Prior to that, some countries had abolished patent systems for pharmaceuticals.  Other countries did not have them.  They had different effects.  The TRIPS waiver required minimum standards.  The Doha declaration was a direct acknowledgement of the need to take into account public health issues when considering IP rights.  Paragraph 4 of the declaration highlights that intellectual property rights should not be used in a way that would damage public health.  That is built into the TRIPS agreement.  If adopted, the waiver has to be negotiated and discussed with the WTO states.  It can only be adopted subject to the WTO rules.  That is built into the system.  It is a temporary waiver.  The TRIPS framework has always provided for waivers.  The Doha declaration was a waiver itself.  This would be no different.<\/p> <p>  We have to be careful about what the waiver would do.  Much would depend on how it is negotiated, whether a text is adopted and what happens in that context.  The waiver originally proposed by India and South Africa was a comprehensive waiver, but it was a temporary suspension of IP rights.  The other important point is that it would suspend such rights at the TRIPS level, so states would not have to comply with TRIPS requirements if they so wished.  However, it is likely that many states like Ireland and other high-income countries with access to Covid-19 vaccines and other health technologies, thankfully, would not need recourse to that waiver.  The effect of the waiver is likely that it would be used by lower-income countries.  It may have impacts, but it will not necessarily have impacts in high-income countries.  As Senator Garvey pointed out, precedents for this exist.  Antiretroviral drugs are made on a generic basis.  Medicines Patent Pool makes products on a generic basis, primarily for lower-income countries.  There are different markets in high-income countries.  It is important to see it in that context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#K00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending.

It is unacceptable that low- and middle-income countries would effectively be deprived of the ability to build up their own capacity to develop vaccines, particularly when millions of lives are at stake.<\/p> <p>  There was a discussion about rules and the changing of rules.

Faced with a lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines the WHO, together with a consortium in South Africa, developed a manufacturing and technology transfer hub.  The idea was to produce Covid-19 mRNA vaccines and, potentially, use the technology afterwards for other diseases.  That initiative asked two pharmaceuticals, BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna, that use mRNA technology and have a product on the market, to share their technology and the rights with the initiative so they could set up a production network with different companies in Africa - so not only in South Africa but in other African countries - and share their technology and teach people how to use, produce and develop these vaccines.  Moderna and BioNTech-Pfizer refused to share their technology, data and production knowledge.  As a result the hub, in particular Afrigen, which is a small or medium-sized enterprise in South Africa, started together with the University of the\u00a0Witwatersrand in Johannesburg to re-engineer the Moderna vaccine and see whether they could develop and produce a vaccine.  Against the odds and expectations within six months they have succeeded in producing a test patch, which looks quite good, but now they will go into clinical trials, and this is another issue.  The fact that data is not openly shared means that this whole production process and clinical trial on whether this product is safe and effective now must be done again, which already exists if Moderna or BioNTech-Pfizer had shared some of their technology and data.  This will cost a lot of time and money but the reality will be that there will be independent production.  Moderna has three patents on mRNA technology in South Africa so they can block the initiative at any time when they start to produce the vaccines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dimitri Eynikel"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":103,"content":"<p>Were the patents lodged after the breakthrough by the mRNA hub in South Africa?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#L00300","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":104,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dimitri Eynikel"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":105,"content":"<p>So it is not something that happened in advance.

If it is the case that the rules or the environment changes where the entirety of that investment and the entirely of their manufacturing capability to deliver medicines and vaccines globally in this respect is to be shared and given for nothing then one has to consider the following.  If that is what the public authorities want then that is fine and it is a policy that one can choose.  However, if we were running the circumstance again, and there is no doubt that there will be another pandemic at some point, can one expect those companies to engage in the same type and level of investment with their capital at risk if they have the level of uncertainty about the intellectual property rights that will govern that investment after it is done?  That is simply the question that we would ask the committee and the Government to consider.  Our answer is clearly \"No\".

If they were crying out for more to be delivered and the industry was not delivering, that would be a different case all together.  However, that is not the case at the moment.  Where we are right now is that the level of production is there.  The industry will continue to develop and increase that level of production so that demand can be met.  On the question of changing the rules, we think it is a change of the rules, obviously.  It certainly changes the environment.  That affects the environment for investment in the future, as well as the environment for the current production.  They are distinct issues to discuss and debate.  The future is something to be thought about very carefully in terms of whether we will see the solutions emerge, in any event.  It is up to public policymakers to make their choice on that and to have whatever risk tolerance they want for that.  My point is that it is very difficult to expect companies to invest, on a constant basis, in their capacity to manufacture and deliver vaccines and medicines on a global basis, with all the regulatory requirements and quality control environments needed, if we are going to change the rules suddenly in respect of a large amount of investment and in respect of every aspect of the production which they have invested in over many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Oliver O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":115,"content":"<p>It strikes me that if we do not change, we will stay where we are.

I agree it is really important that we think about the need for change.  Production has been an issue all the way through this, and it will be an issue again.  We may have a new variant of SARS-CoV-2.  We may have a completely new virus that is capable of causing a pandemic.  The chances of that are probably going to increase over time.  Climate change, urbanisation and global mobility are all increasing the risk of a new viral pandemic.  The current model that we have, whereby bilateral agreements between governments and the pharmaceutical industry are prioritised and leftover supplies are given to those with lower buying power, has to change.  It will change eventually.  The question for us is whether we want to do it sooner rather than later.  I feel that Ireland is in a really good position to stand up and take leadership on that now.  We have to drive forward a new global vaccination distribution model that is centrally based and clinically prioritised.  With the current model, pandemics will go on for longer and more people will die.  Global health security is at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Christine Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":120,"content":"<p>I wish to respond and add to some of the points just made.  Most people would agree that the current TRIPS <i>status quo<\/i>model has really failed low- and middle-income countries not just in the context of Covid-19 but also in other contexts, such as infectious diseases like malaria and other diseases where the incentives for innovation do not necessarily match the health need.  On the question of current supplies, it is true that there are more supplies at the moment.  That is a very good and positive thing.  However, the difficulty is that when we look back at this, we see that in 2020 and 2021 when we were at the height of Covid-19, vaccines were being distributed on the basis of bilateral deals, not necessarily on the basis of health need.  That is exactly how the TRIPS framework is set up.  The problem, as Dr. Kelly has pointed out, is that if we have a new variant, the same is very likely to happen.  The other issue is that even though there may be more vaccines in some states, as we have already discussed, many low- and middle-income countries want the ability to make their own vaccines so that they can have a secure and stable supply.  Charity and donations do not do that.  Indeed, many activists in the global south have highlighted that countries do not necessarily want to rely on charity or donations.  They have their place.  It is important to recognise the contribution of COVAX in the short term, in particular, but COVAX charity donations just do not provide long-term sustainable supply.  The other point that we should be clear on is that Covid-19 is a global pandemic.  It is probably the worst health crisis that we have faced in our lifetime, in terms of its global impact.  The TRIPS waiver is being discussed in that context, and in a context where voluntary mechanisms such as C-TAP were suggested by the WHO.  Sadly, they did not have enough support from states and industry to be successful.  It is in that context that we are discussing mandatory solutions like the waiver.  Let us be clear, IP is not the only issue.  There are other issues as well.  However, if we do not address the IP obstacles, we will not have those other solutions.  That is what I would add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#M00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Aisling McMahon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":121,"content":"<p>I agree that we cannot have a pandemic response based solely on donations.  It is just not a feasible model.  We need a stronger and more effective model.  I want to go back to the principle that we are discussing here, which is basically to provide governments with the tools available to protect their populations in the middle of a pandemic.  It is about telling them that they have the freedom to operate and produce the tools they need to protect their people.  I hear, from the industry side, that there is a change of rules.  Let us go back for a moment.  What happened 20 years ago was that patent rights could be overruled with compulsory licensing.  That principle was already there.  As Professor McMahon explained, it was there in the Doha declaration and the TRIPS agreement.  What happened afterwards was that the industry started to push for other tools to protect its intellectual property, by protecting the data related to the products and protecting the trade secrets on how to produce certain complex products etc., in addition to the patents, which was not so much the case 20 years ago.  There was a change in the rules that happened over those 20 years, with additional protections.  These are exactly the barriers we are discussing today with the TRIPS waiver.  We are saying that compulsory licensing is a valuable tool, but it falls short because there are other elements that have been added over the course of the 20 years that make it more and more difficult to reproduce some of these medicines when they are needed.  That is where a waiver for a certain period of time will cut through the red tape.  Countries will be able to produce and supply the medicines, and import and export any tools and raw materials as well.  The issue of raw materials has been brought up.  It also falls under the same category.  The waiver will resolve the raw materials issue as well.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dimitri Eynikel"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":122,"content":"<p>There is a genuine concern we will find ourselves back in another pandemic situation, where we were in 2020-2021, which is that the global south was prioritised for whatever reason.

Before I get to that answer, on this constant referring to the big threat to pharma created by this, the reality is that pharma has never seen profits like it has seen in recent years, and many new billionaires have been created in the pharma industry.  While it did extraordinary work and everybody wants to give the credit for it, the idea that somehow this temporary waiver which we keep reiterating, which is a waiver based within a rules-based system that already exists, will somehow greatly and detrimentally damage pharma and the development of medications into the future is just not believable, to be perfectly honest.  I give tremendous credit to the industry to adapt, evolve, move within the spaces that are there, and make profits, because is what it does.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Let us just not keep knocking that one back that it will somehow lead to devastation of the industry.  It will not.<\/p> <p>  On the question that this must be on a human rights and health needs basis rather than some charitable act where, when we are ready to provide vaccines to poorer countries, we will, we know what happened at the start of this.  Wealthy countries raced to push others out of the way to get as many vaccines as they could, even fighting among themselves, let alone with countries in the global south.  We cannot have a system that allows that to happen again because everybody will be affected.<\/p> <p>  Let us remember that even from a self-interest point of view, which should not be the way we think about these things, the longer this goes on, the greater the possibility of new variants arising and the more it will affect everybody.  Even economically, if that is the way one wants to look at it, the International Chamber of Commerce reckons that $9.2 trillion is going to be lost because of the pandemic and because of our inability to get our hands around it fast enough.  This will roll on and on.  The countries we are talking about are vital countries for us and for the world.  I am just putting that argument, which would not be of our core argument, just to put it out there.<\/p> <p>  On this issue, Ireland has traditionally shown tremendous leadership and courage.  We were speaking to our colleagues at the UN Security Council earlier this week about the work they are doing in pushing into very difficult spaces and trying to resolve issues by using the Irish moral standing and respect the country has across the world to push agenda items.  Here is another one where Ireland can make a difference.  We know it is a European decision, but to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly, it will be decided by the trade element of Government, and in this case the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, will be the representative in that space.  This is the right place as far as we are concerned to be discussing this issue and I know the Chair appreciates that.<\/p> <p>  We emphasise that if every country sits back and waits for this to happen, it will not happen.  Ireland can make a difference, is very credible, has deservedly built up this very strong reputation, has sacrificed as a result of it and is willing to do so.  We plead with the committee to urge the Minister and the Government to make a decision to support the TRIPS waiver or the elements to it that are essential in order for vaccines to be created locally to give that autonomy of supply to ensure the rest of the world will be vaccinated.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will be waiting for years if we are to continue on the current basis.  We have a solution.  It is not perfect but we know it can work.  We have the examples of what happened in the past where a transformation can be made when the political courage is there.  We plead with the committee and the Government to move, to agree to the TRIPS waiver and to bring its voice to the table in Europe to try to have it change its position also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#N00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Clarken"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":124,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Stanton wish to make further brief contribution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022051100002#N00500","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":125,"content":"<p>Very briefly, I will refer to a number of things.

We are inviting the committee to consider that a change in incentives or in intellectual property rights may cause a change in the likelihood of capital being invested to invent, create, deliver, manufacture and provide vaccines and other medicine solutions in pandemic situations.  We have as evidence a study by the European Patents Office, EPO, to show that in its view and analysis there would be a diminution, and quite a serious one, in investment in this area.  We work very closely in every country and in every medicine to deliver human health.  If we do not deliver human health, there is no business for pharmaceutical companies.  In that respect, we support and deliver human rights.  There is no opposition within the pharmaceutical industry to human rights or to human health.  We are not in the business of raising barriers to the delivery of healthcare solutions here in Ireland or globally, and we want to work on that.<\/p> <p>  To answer Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question, we are certainly not saying that everything should stay the same.  There will have to be new solutions, but we invite members to consider the critical role of intellectual property rights in the discovery, development, production and delivery of the solutions we seek to massive healthcare problems at all times and to be very careful about protecting those rights.

I can give a concrete example.  Pfizer has in fact lobbied on the Covid-19 Bill, as it has also been described in the media.  It is applying for patents worldwide and has signed a voluntary agreement for generic production, which is good for certain countries.  The supply at Pfizer itself has been bought up almost until the end of the year.  Half of the world does not have access to the generic production.  That means this other half of the world has almost no access to any supply at all.  That is very problematic, obviously, for a disease that is so lethal at this stage and is still being widely transmitted.<\/p><p>I can give another example of a Roche drug that is given to severe Covid-19 patients.  There is a severe lack of supply.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res tried for several months to place an order with Roche and never succeeded so we did not get access to the treatments because of a lack of supply.  Where it is available, it is over $700 per treatment in India, which is a huge amount for people there to pay.  I could go on for a list of treatments and vaccines.  That is one element.

My colleagues Mr. Cullen and Mr. Sheridan are from our income tax and indirect tax units, respectively.<\/p> <p>  We are meeting at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and economic volatility.  As well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created a large supply side shock that has shaken the global economy, with European economies at the epicentre.  Given Russia's outsized role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen sharply in recent months.  As Ireland is a global price taker, this has fed through to higher energy prices for businesses and households.<\/p> <p>  It is important we give some context to the current inflationary environment.  The emergence of inflationary pressures contrasts markedly with the relatively low inflation we experienced for the guts of the past decade.  In Ireland, inflation averaged at 0.5% between 2010 and 2019 and at 1.5% in the euro area.  Initially, the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this low inflation environment.  As the decline in demand in 2020 outstripped the fall in supply, Ireland's inflation turned negative, reaching something like -0.5%.<\/p> <p>  While consumer price inflation remained subdued in Ireland in the first quarter of last year, the annual rate of inflation picked up sharply thereafter, with both domestic and global factors behind the increase.  These included a recovery in energy prices from their lows in 2020 - we call these base effects - as well as global supply chain disruptions, supply side bottlenecks and pent-up demand.  To address this, budget 2022 in October contained an income tax package to the value of &euro;520 million.  This involved increases in the standard rate band and key personal tax credits.  On the expenditure side, a social welfare package worth approximately &euro;560 million was introduced, as were a range of other measures, including health and childcare supports, aimed at mitigating the cost of living.  At the time of budget 2022, inflationary pressures were expected to ease over the course of the winter and throughout this year.  However, higher than anticipated energy prices throughout last winter resulted in higher than expected inflation in the winter and into early spring.<\/p> <p>  The war in Ukraine has served to exacerbate inflationary pressures further.  Inflation stood at 7.25% in April, which was the highest rate since the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, series began in 1997.  This is a trend we are seeing in all advanced economies.  In the euro area, inflation reached 7.5% in April.  Today, the US reported that its inflation rate had reduced to 8.3% in April from 8.5% in March.  The rates in the UK have been similar.<\/p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices are expected to continue feeding into higher inflation over the coming months.  As set out in the stability programme update, SPU, in late April and based on market prices at the time of the forecast, inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, peaking in the second quarter of this year and averaging at approximately 6.25% for the year as a whole.  Pass-through price effects are also expected in other sectors such as food through higher prices for energy and fertilisers - the latter is a by-product of higher energy prices itself - and consumer goods and services, also through higher energy prices and transport costs, with core inflation of approximately 4% projected for the year.  A significant easing is anticipated next year, with the headline rate projected to be approximately 3% for 2023 as a whole.  In fact, energy prices, while still expected to stay high, are expected to ease next year.<\/p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices will erode the real incomes of households while also denting the margins of firms.  This, alongside heightened uncertainty, will dampen consumer spending and private sector investment this year.  In this manner, inflation will act as a headwind against output growth.  As a result, we have revised downwards our forecast for modified domestic demand growth &ndash; our main indicator of economic activity &ndash; by approximately two and a quarter percentage points this year, with growth of 4.25% being forecast.<\/p> <p>  These projections were produced against a backdrop of exceptional uncertainty.  As such, risks to the forecast are considerable and firmly tilted to the down side.  In light of this, we also published a scenario analysis in the SPU in which wholesale oil and gas prices returned to their early March levels &ndash; indeed, slightly higher &ndash; and remained elevated relative to the baseline throughout this year.  Gas prices in this scenario are 75% above the baseline projection and oil prices are approximately 50% higher.  In this scenario, inflation would be two percentage points higher this year at 8.25% &ndash; peaking at 9.25% in the third quarter &ndash; and one and a quarter percentage points higher next year at 4.25%.  Of course, the energy price shock would not only affect inflation and would also have broader macroeconomic implications.  Output in the domestic economy would be approximately 2% lower over the medium term and the budget surplus of in or around &euro;1.2 billion for next year would be wiped out.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the Government's more recent response to increases in energy prices from a taxation perspective, and my colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will speak about expenditure measures.  In early March, the Government approved a VAT-inclusive reduction in excise duty of 20 cent per litre on petrol, 15 cent per litre on diesel and 2 cent per litre on marked gas oil, MGO, amounting to &euro;320 million.  Further measures were announced in mid-April, including a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas to 9% from 1 May until the end of October, which should result in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas bills and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  The cost of this measure is estimated at &euro;46 million.  There was also a further VAT-inclusive reduction of 3 cent per litre on MGO from 1 May and an extension of the reduction in excise duties on MGO, auto diesel and petrol to mid-October, with a combined cost just shy of &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>  Overall, including the expenditure measures that colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will shortly outline, cost-of-living measures announced since the budget amount to just over &euro;1 billion on top of the roughly &euro;1.1 billion in measures announced in budget 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the measures introduced since budget 2022.  Budget 2022 set out an expenditure allocation of &euro;87.6 billion for investment in public services.  This allocation was made in line with the medium-term expenditure strategy, which sets out core expenditure growth of approximately 5% on average over the period to 2025.  A &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures was announced to support citizens across a range of sectors with cost-of-living pressures.  Some of the headline measures were increases in social protection payments, including weekly working age and pension payments, the living alone allowance, qualified child increase and fuel allowance; health affordability measures; funding for social and affordable housing; and enhanced student and childcare supports.<\/p> <p>  Analysis was undertaken using the ESRI's simulation welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, tax and benefit model to illustrate the impact of the budget.  The combination of tax and expenditure measures was progressive in nature, with households in the lowest income deciles seeing the strongest gains.<\/p> <p>  The economic and social context has changed considerably since the announcement of budget 2022 in October.  The emergence of this new set of challenges, including rising energy prices and the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine, has resulted in a number of budgetary developments.  Since December 2021, in the region of &euro;560 million in additional expenditure measures has been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs.  A number of these measures build on supports put in place in budget 2022.<\/p> <p>  I will set out a summary of the main measures.  An energy credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs.  This will benefit more than 2 million households at an Exchequer expenditure cost of just under &euro;380 million.  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in fuel allowance payments introduced in the budget, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit more than 370,000 households.  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the working family payment.  The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the drugs payment scheme was also introduced.  This will reduce medicine and drug costs for more than 70,000 recipients.  A temporary 20% reduction in public service obligation, PSO, public transport fares until the end of 2022 was introduced to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.  The estimated cost of this is &euro;54 million.  The maximum annual school transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year.<\/p><p>A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licensed heavy goods vehicles for a period of eight weeks.  This scheme reflects the vital role hauliers play in the supply chain.  The estimated cost is &euro;18 million.<\/p><p> Turning to the impact of construction inflation on public works projects, a number of changes were introduced in January to address price volatility.  These changes were made to contracting arrangements for new contracts to ameliorate challenges arising from inflationary pressures deriving from the pandemic.  Based on extensive feedback from Departments and owing to further constraints on supply chains and increased fuel and energy prices arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, yesterday announced the introduction of an inflation co-operation framework for those parties engaged under public works contracts.  This seeks to address the impacts of the most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption.<\/p><p> The Revised Estimates 2022 set out an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.6 billion.  This is inclusive of an unallocated contingency reserve of &euro;3.9 billion.  At this stage, approximately &euro;1.5 billion of the reserve has been committed, taking into account the increased Covid-related supports introduced in response to the December wave of the virus, and additional funding required for the cost-of-living measures I have outlined.  Furthermore, there will also be calls on the contingency reserve in the coming months in the context of any additional Covid-related expenditure, in particular as we enter the winter period, and for the provision of humanitarian supports to refugees arriving from Ukraine.  A Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29 - Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, was brought before the D&aacute;il in March.  Further Supplementary Estimates may be required later this year to provide for the measures I have set out.<\/p><p> The series of recently introduced measures to support households with cost of living pressures comes at a time of significant additional expenditure to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  The public finances are in a stronger position than this time last year, with Covid-19 related supports being unwound and tax revenue increasing.  However, risks to the fiscal position remain.  Borrowing since the beginning of the pandemic has increased, with gross general government debt of &euro;234 billion forecast for 2022 compared with &euro;204 billion at the end of 2019.  In this context, Government has sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation.  I thank members for this opportunity to speak with the committee.  We look forward to answering questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":142,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kinnane.

I have two questions.  They relate to a couple of pieces I was reading about France.  In the context of the offsets by the Government, my layman's interpretation is that if you throw money at an economy during an inflationary period in terms of wages and things like that, it just helps to drive up the cost of living if the relevant measures are not targeted.  I advise our guests the cost of living is significantly impacting on constituents of mine, as it is on those of all my colleagues.  I read an interesting article about France.  The country was in election mode, but that does not matter.  The article stated: \"A decision last year to limit the amount by which France&rsquo;s largely state-owned energy companies could raise prices has benefited consumers and taken some of the inflationary pressure off industries that depend on gas and electricity.\"  The article also points to the fact that the electricity component of inflation in France has risen by 4% in the past 12 months but by an average of more than 27% in the eurozone generally.  France obviously took a measure there.  It could not ban an increase in energy prices by the energy suppliers but it did bring in a regulation that restricted the amount by which the suppliers could raise their prices.  My first question relates to whether those options open to Ministers here.  The officials may come back and say that France has had other problems, with other costs of living skyrocketing too.<\/p> <p>  Another piece I read recently also relates to France.  Macron has won the election and must deliver on some promises.  I am interested in the following concept though.  He is looking at trying to cap the prices of say, the top 120 essential items that we would get in our supermarkets or that families need.  In other words, this would cover the staples.  I would like to hear the officials reactions to those two issues.  I have no other questions after that.

The approach taken by Government was to introduce the energy credit to offset part of the increase in the electricity bills and then to use the fuel allowance as a means of targeting the additional funding at the most vulnerable sections of society and possibly the sections of society that are seeing higher levels of inflation because more of their income is being spent on the items the Deputy highlighted.  That is the logic behind the approach, namely, to provide the broad-based support through the energy credit and then the targeted support through the fuel allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":148,"content":"<p>We do not know this but maybe France does not have an energy regulator so that is out of the hands of Government here in this sense, even though most of the energy companies in France are state-owned.<\/p> <p>  The second piece was about being able to look at the top 120 most important staple retail purchases.

As far as I know, the rate of inflation in France was something of the order of 5.4% in April.  I guess we are getting desensitised because in Ireland in April it was 7.3%, so it is comparatively lower.  If you look at Irish inflation though, energy prices most recently, I think in April, had gone up year on year by something of the order of 44%.  It only about 8% or 9% of the overall basket but that sort of increase probably accounted for about half of the inflationary increase or there or thereabouts.  Thereafter, we are still seeing some price increases on the goods side.  Essentially, for the past decade, goods prices year on year were generally negative, for many reasons.  There was low-cost production in the far east and benefits from global supply chains kept prices low.  That has slightly reversed.  The pandemic has given rise to higher goods prices in Ireland and of course food is an issue.  However, we are not yet in the space where some goods and some foods are the subject of very strong rates of inflation.<\/p><p>On the basis of recent data, the price of energy is still the main driver of inflation.  Today's data are interesting and show that US inflation was 8.3% in the month of April, but that core inflation, stripping out energy prices - energy actually fell by 6% in the US in April - was 6.2%.  While the Deputy's question was about France, price increases in the US appear to be much more broadly based than in Ireland.  In Ireland and in some other European countries, it has been very much concentrated on energy to date.<\/p><p> There will be some exceptions in the context of some products in the basket, but it is not yet at the stage where it is being passed through.  We are expecting that to happen.  I stated earlier that we expect to see the effects passed through.  Obviously, food is one to watch.  While there might be exceptions on a product-by-product basis, on aggregate, food price inflation is not accelerating very strongly.  At this point, it is still relatively low and, interestingly, still lower than the euro area average.  Of course, we have seen extraordinarily high increases in fertiliser prices.  One fifth of our fertiliser comes from Russia.  It is one of the things in respect of which prices have accelerated quite a bit.  Wheat prices and general energy prices, particularly that of gas, will have an impact on products.  It will take a bit of time.  We might see it later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor is right.  It would be interesting to drill down into this.  An Indian friend of mine is one of the hardest-working people I have ever come across.  He has worked really hard.  He opened an Indian restaurant in Deputy Boyd Barrett's area between Monkstown and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He opened a second restaurant in Sandyford just before the Covid pandemic.  He has managed to keep them both going.  The man in question told me that a 15 kg tin of tomatoes was &euro;9 before Christmas and now costs &euro;18.  A tray of fresh chicken from his supplier used to cost &euro;43 or &euro;44 but he got it discounted to &euro;38 because he was a regular purchaser.  It now costs &euro;83 or &euro;84, discounted to &euro;78.  He has also been affected by the cost of petrol and diesel.  This is because he does a lot of deliveries for people who order takeaways.<\/p> <p>  I asked him if he was planning on increasing his prices.  He told me he was waiting until September.  Indian food is hot food and people tend not to come out to the restaurants so much at this time of year.  It is more of a winter kind of thing in colder weather.  Last week, I walked up Pembroke Road and looked at the menu in FX Buckley's.  I noticed that an 8 oz fillet steak costs &euro;42 and that a 10 oz one costs &euro;46.  FX Buckley is a good butcher, and it has a number of high-end restaurants for those who can afford to pay the prices.  Those are colossal prices.  My Indian friend had not passed on the cost to the consumer.  If he does in September, if others are also holding back, it will be pretty substantial.<\/p> <p>  The figures I have provided are not made up; they are real figures.  I was very much taken aback by what I discovered.  I do not expect feedback, I am just highlighting this as something to keep an eye on.  I am surprised at what Mr. O'Connor said to the effect that most of our inflation relates to energy.  It is very noticeable that the price of a cup of coffee and the other bits and pieces people buy all seem to be increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":152,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor wish to come back on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":153,"content":"<p>I do not disagree that certain products are probably the subject of high rates of inflation.  Regarding the aggregate for food, I am just looking at the March data.  In March, inflation stood at 6.9%.  Food price inflation contributed about one percentage point in total to that.  Energy contributed approximately four percentage points which brings it up to five percentage points between food and energy.  Obviously, goods and services make up the extra two percentage points to make 6.9%.  That is the average.  Obviously in every month there will be some items in any given basket with very strong rates of inflation, for instance the ones the Deputy has mentioned.  There will be some that will experience decreases.  On aggregate, for food and non-energy staples we are not yet experiencing very high rates of inflation.  I certainly would expect to see food prices rising over time, particularly given that the price of wheat has increased by 44% and with very high rates of inflation for things like fertiliser, which has increased by 75%.  In fairness, we have relatively strong projections for core inflation, non-energy inflation, of about 4% this year anyway.  That would probably tally with what the Deputy is saying.  We are expecting to see it in an aggregate sense later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I thank our guests for have giving of their very valuable time today.  The times we are facing are extremely unusual.  Deputy Lahart gave examples of his hard-working and nice friend who is struggling with the ever-increasing costs of the goods he supplies to his customers.  I have been a small shopkeeper for over 30 years.  Particular goods we have in a shop are called lines.  One of the biggest problems we now have with an awful lot of lines in a shop is not the cost of them, which is outside our control, but the actual supply of those lines.  It is the most random things.  For example, it can be a type of fruit, tinned food or anything.  It is the most unusual thing that can happen all of a sudden and it can go on for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months in every shop.  For instance, it could be lemons and there would not be a lemon to be got in any shop because they will only last for so long.  If the supply has stopped, everyone in a particular locality has no lemons and that can go on for weeks or months.  That has been happening with many hundreds of lines.  That is a problem we seem to be having.  I am afraid it will be beyond the reach of everybody to try and sort that.  It seems to be getting worse.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak about public contracts.  In case that anybody says that I have a conflict I am not declaring, I just want to say that I work at public contracts.  I would not have any benefit or loss necessarily.  I would be working as a subcontractor for larger contractors.  My interest is obviously in the provision and delivery of the major public works that we want to do, such as our school building programme, road building programme and hospital extensions works.<\/p> <p>  For some time, I have been shouting about and looking for something to help contractors with inflation.  I welcome the inflation co-operation framework that was announced yesterday.  My question for the guests is whether they really think this will be enough.  In other words, will we still be able to get contractors to sign a contract with local authorities or the housing department to build so many houses at such a cost?  Will people take on the building of a bypass or a new section of road and agree to tie themselves into contract prices?  Will the assurance and what we might call the comfort zone which was provided yesterday be enough to ensure that the State will continue delivering on the programme that we are committed to delivering?<\/p> <p>  For instance, regarding access into County Kerry, we obviously want to see the Macroom bypass finished.  We want to see Listowel bypass, which has been started, finished.  We want to see the bypass coming down from Adare started.  Those are concerns I have.  The same applies to hospital works and school building programmes.  Many schools are on a programme for refurbishment and some are awaiting an entirely new school.<\/p><p>Some of those are in County Kerry and throughout the rest of the country.  When I am talking about Kerry, I am obviously talking about the rest of the country as well, because everybody has these concerns.  Do our guests think the measures put in place are enough to ensure we will continue delivering the works we have promised?  That is the first issue.<\/p><p> The second issue is our energy security, on which I have spoken and campaigned for a long period of time.  I was extremely disappointed that the provision of a liquefied natural gas facility was abandoned in the programme for Government.  I was obviously very disappointed with the Green Party, but I was hoping Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would have insisted on it staying in the programme for Government but they did not.  They all abandoned it.  How do our guests think the lack of energy security in Ireland will hinder and upset the ever-increasing cost of our electricity?<\/p><p> In recent days, I was contacted by people from a middling-sized town.  They run a chipper.  It is not McDonald's or Burger King.  It is just a chipper run by two family members.  They are very efficient and hardworking people.  They told me that their monthly ESB bill is &euro;10,000 every two months, that is &euro;5,000 a month.  They said that this is unsustainable.  They cannot put up the price of a carton of chips or a burger to cover this cost.  They have to be mindful of their pricing structure to ensure their customers can afford to go to them.  They have been in business for many years and they are seriously considering throwing in the towel.<\/p><p> Due to the fact that we will be so reliant in the future on England and France, and we are dropping the ball as a Government in ensuring we have gas or energy supplies ourselves, we are letting down those types of hard-working people and, indeed, young couples and householders who have endured enormous price hikes.  All we are being told is that it will continue.  That is unsustainable.  I would like to hear our guests' opinion on the Government taxing the life out of them, doing very little to help them, and at the same time saying it will try to give them back a bit of money by taking a couple of hundred euro off their ESB bills to keep them quiet.  The people are not falling for that.<\/p><p> We saw the rejection of what happened in the North when Green Party policies were thrown out the window.  That might be an eye-opener to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in the South as to what will happen here if people do not realise that the big issue today is mom's purse.  While we have great financial witnesses here today, they will know exactly what I mean by mom's purse.  If mom's purse is not right on a Friday evening, everything will be wrong in the world of finance after that.  Saturday, Sunday and Monday will get off to a very bad start if mom's purse is not right on Friday evening.  I was brought up to believe that.  If that purse is not able to pay the bills, run the show, and have a couple of pounds for a rainy day, everything will be in disarray and chaos as far as I am concerned.<\/p><p> The last issue I raise is farming.  It comes back to the most basic need of all, which is feed.  In order to have feed, we must have fertiliser.  I thought I would not live to see the day when bags of fertiliser would cost &euro;50 or &euro;55, a price which continues to go up.  One would nearly want to take the fertiliser out with a spoon in case one would waste any bit of it because it is so valuable.  It is crazy.  That model is unsustainable.  Some parties have said that they want to reduce the national herd.  This will make it very easy for them because people will not be able to keep the animals over the winter.  If they cannot keep animals over the winter and if we do not have a supply of beef coming into the trade, we will have food shortages because it will not be viable for farmers to stay in business and supply milk, beef, or lamb.<\/p><p> We have seen what happened in the pig industry.  It is unsustainable for pigs to be sold at a loss of up to &euro;30 and &euro;35 per pig.  Many people might not think about that.  Our hardworking piggeries that have survived different calamities over the years will be forced to closed in the coming months.  The package that was delivered was a sop.  It meant nothing in real financial terms.  I could provide figures in which it equated to 35 cent per pig to certain piggeries that supply an awful lot of pigs in the trade and whose losses are enormous.<\/p><p> We are facing very serious problems.  At the same time, we heard the Minister for Finance last week, and I have heard him in other public outings, say that the moneys coming into the Exchequer are very large.  While that might be happening, mom's purse is in serious difficulty and jeopardy at present.  I want to know what more we can do about it.  The idea that this scheme and that scheme will be made available is akin to chasing our tail.  What we have to do is try to bring down the massive increase in the cost of living that the people endure.  Today, for example, there was a motion before the D&aacute;il on wage increases.  I would love for people to have larger wages but we have to be mindful of the employers who are trying to pay those wages and find it very difficult to run their businesses.  Again, it is a case of the dog chasing the tail.  If we could arrest the massive increase in the cost of living, everything might start to stabilise.  I am sorry if I have gone on too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>The Deputy is just a little over time.

Under the contracts for public works that were in place prior to 7 January, there were stringent requirements in the cost of recovery during the fixed-price period.

Some issues were highlighted and a number of contracting authorities and Departments raised these with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They included difficulties with existing contracts and issues as a result of the high increases in fuel costs, which were impacting on contracts for roads that require a large amount of machinery.  Bitumen was also an issue there.  Following this engagement, the Minister decided to make further changes.  These changes addressed contracts that were already in place in January.<\/p> <p>  At the time of the January changes, it was anticipated that we might see a moderation in inflation and that contracts which were already in place would be able to manage within the existing contractual arrangements.<\/p><p>The changes introduced yesterday now allow for retrospective recovery of price increases on materials with respect to payments made since 1 January for projects delivered under the old forms of contract dated prior to 7 January 2022.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at the point that they submitted their tender.  This applies until the completion of the project.  There is also retrospective recovery of price increases associated with energy and fuel with respect to payments since 1 January for projects being delivered under forms of contracts dated prior to 7 January.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at a defined date.  This will also apply until the completion of the project.<\/p><p> The forms of contract dated from 7 January already contain measures to recover inflation on materials over defined thresholds.  However, recovery of energy and fuel prices will now also be permitted as part of the measures introduced by the Minister yesterday.<\/p><p> Bearing in mind the supply chain disruption which contractors are facing, relief is also being provided in the form of an extension of the date for completion for the contract where there is disruption to the supply of materials linked to the war or to the pandemic for all public works contracts.  The measures set out by the Minister represent a balanced and proportionate response that looks to protect the delivery of the national development plan in a manner that also protects the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":159,"content":"<p>I will make a very brief point.  Deputy Healy-Rae made reference to mom&rsquo;s purse.  He is speaking there to inflation and to the cost of living in a general sense, and I like the way he has put it.  We have had big increases in the Irish economy in gas and oil prices and we know why that happened.  These were obviously rising last year as well.  There were very strange things going on in gas markets in the world.  Gas is usually bought in a therm - do not ask me to explain what a therm is or what it looks like - and, generally speaking, it costs about 50 British pence for a therm.  It has been like that for a very long time where it may be 40 cent in the summer, where one is not using a great deal of gas, and 60 cent, perhaps, in the winter.  It increased considerably last year and breached the &pound;1 mark and was &pound;4 at one stage during the early days of the war.  These are price levels we have never seen in natural gas and there has obviously been a big oil price shock.  The cost of fertiliser is up approximately 150%, and this is also a by-product of natural gas.  Wheat, corn, soya beans, cooking and sunflower oil, one can name any product, and they have all increased greatly in price.  These are all things we import.<\/p> <p>  Earlier on we spoke somewhat about food prices and capping such staples.  We domestically produce some of these, such as cooked chickens or unprocessed foods, but we import many of these.  Essentially, income in Ireland is going to producers of fossil fuels around the world and the economy as a whole is poorer.<\/p> <p>  There is also then this debate or judgement, and one is getting into the core of policy here which I will not really comment on, about who takes that burden, be they households, firms or the Government.  Previously and certainly in the 1970s, and I have followed much of the discussion that has gone on recently about things like stagflation, which is where there is high inflation and low growth, the view at the time was that governments should borrow a great deal of money, run massive deficits and try to protect the full economy from the oil price shock as it was at the time, and from OPEC essentially.  Growth rates collapsed afterwards and unemployment completely skyrocketed.<\/p> <p>  The judgement that is being made now is that the Government will bear some of the cost and try to do this in a targeted manner.  That then becomes a decision, judgement or analysis as to whether that is enough, but much of the analysis, which I believe Mr. Kinnane mentioned in his opening statement, has shown that most of the gains have been to lower income households, which is what I think one probably tries to do when one targets these measures.  At least the gains from those are going to the types of households that one wants to target these measures at.  The higher income households, obviously, have a great deal of savings from the pandemic, and the analysis shows that things like the types of subsidies and allowances Mr. Kinnane spoke about are going to the lower income groups.  That is probably as much as I can say without going into policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Perhaps following on from that point, Mr. O&rsquo;Connor put it well there when he said that the rising cost of energy is going into the pocket of energy providers.  This very accurately describes what is going on.  Somebody is benefiting from these price rises and it is the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers.  I wonder if any consideration has been given or has there been any discussion at all - I appreciate Mr O&rsquo;Connor cannot veer too much into policy as this is the area for politicians, and so on - about trying to control the cost of these things essentially by levying, either at a national, European or international level, the profits of those who are doing well ?  There is much international co-ordination going on these days, with unprecedented unity in the European Union when it comes to sanctions.  Is there any thought on co-ordination when it comes to controlling the price or the profits, or both, of the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers?Might that be a way to address the problem rather than chasing the price increases by giving money to people but, essentially, that is just public money going to those fossil fuel or energy companies?<\/p><p>I noted the discussion earlier on about what legislative powers are available to the Government.  I take the point that the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might not necessarily be familiar with that.  To address the point raised by Deputy Lahart and to familiarise people with it, the power exists to control the price of goods in, I believe, sections 60 and 61 of the Consumer Protection Act, where in situations of emergency the Government is allowed to control maximum and unit prices of goods and services.  Legislative power is there to do that and I wonder if any consideration has been given to doing that in the discussions as to how we might deal with these things, because it is worth saying the profits of energy companies have gone up considerably.<\/p><p>I will also be interested in hearing some comment because the profits of these energy companies went up long before the war in Ukraine and so have the prices.  To my mind, Ukraine is obviously having an impact, but there were also increases in energy and fuel prices before the war in Ukraine.  I would like to hear our guests comment on that and on why that was happening.  The website <i>bonkers.ie<\/i>has in recent days done some work in this area and estimated that energy prices in Ireland are something like 25% higher than the average in Europe and are among the highest prices in Europe.<\/p><p>Four other countries in Europe have energy prices in the same high range as us.  Why are we at the higher end?  Twenty years ago, we had some of the lowest energy prices in Europe, before the deregulation and privatisation of ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and so on but we now have some of the highest energy prices.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p><p> There is a narrative that, given the impact of Ukraine, fossil fuel supply and the cost of fossil fuels, we need to develop more renewable energy.  We need to do that anyway for climate reasons.  Is it correct to say that even if we develop much renewable energy, it will have no impact whatsoever on the market price or even on the security of supply?  We have much more wind energy in this country than we used to, but it has not coincided with a reduction in electricity prices, even though we produce far more wind energy than we used to.  It has coincided with an increase in energy prices because, no matter how much energy is produced, the international market sets the price.  Energy production could be 100% renewable and it would not make any difference to the cost of electricity unless we publicly owned and controlled it and the prices.  Is that correct?  At the moment, all those prices are set by the market.<\/p><p> In their opening statement on the cost of living, the witnesses did not make much reference to the cost of housing and rent and what we will do about that.  Will they comment on that?  I am of the view that we need to bring in rent controls and to have maximum price ceilings on what can be charged, because every other measure seems to have failed.  I do not believe there is any evidence that ramping up supply will lead to a reduction in rents or house prices, as the Government is saying.  I do not know of any evidence in the history of this State of rents or house prices falling just because supply happened to be increasing.  The opposite happened in the Celtic tiger period.  Does the Department of Finance think, if we ramp up supply, that rents and house prices will fall at some point?  If that is the thinking, where is the evidence for believing that might be the case?  I do not see how it could happen and do not think there is any precedent for it happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#F00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first point was about the knowledge or otherwise of energy regulation.  I will hold my hands up and say that I am certainly no expert on this.  In response to Deputy Lahart's question, I understand that while price caps could be implemented, there are certain key considerations.  The key driver of the increase in costs is the increase in raw material prices, including natural gas and oil.  The ability for energy companies to absorb this may be limited and price caps could be an issue.  In the UK, some electricity suppliers which had a price cap went out of business.  The other crucial aspect follows on from points made by Mr. O'Connor about distributive impacts of the measures taken.  A cap is broad-based by its very nature and everybody benefits.  The measures the Government introduced in February applied a mix of broad-based measures through the energy credit and using the fuel allowance, in the social welfare system, to provide additional support of &euro;225 in two lump sum payments to the 370,000 recipients of the fuel allowance.  This approach of targeting funding and support to the most vulnerable can be effective in alleviating the burden on people who are experiencing difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":163,"content":"<p>My knowledge of the consumer legislation is extremely limited, so that is new information on the use of caps.  Being a macroeconomist, the policy advice that I give is quite different to this issue.  I have limited knowledge of the profitability of energy companies in Ireland.  Some are State-owned and some are not.  The majority, with probably just one notable exception, buy energy on international markets and essentially just supply households and businesses domestically.  We have a gigantic cost shock.  If the price was capped, someone would bear the burden, including owners of those firms, which is the State in some instances.  I have not looked at the balance sheets or profitability positions, so I could not comment.  Someone has to bear the cost of what comes into the country.  The Government has made some effort to alleviate the burden on certain households.  The private sector has to bear some costs as well and probably is in some examples we have given here.  The economy, society and State as a whole are worse off from the shock.  Where the burden of policies fall has to be thought through.  It is like when one pushes something down a hole and wonders where it will pop up on the other side.  If I had given it more thought, I would probably be able to do more analysis today, but these are the thoughts I have here.<\/p> <p>  The Government has a housing policy, which I understand is settled.  The intention is to increase supply and there are various mechanisms to do so.  Supply is increasing.  First quarter numbers were the strongest in the series.  There is seasonality to housing supply.  One should not multiply the 5,000 or 6,000 units produced in the first quarter by four and end up with an annual number, because numbers generally pick up throughout the year.  Those numbers in the first quarter are encouraging and suggest a substantial increase in year-on-year supply.  Approximately 35,000 housing units have started construction in the last 12 months.  That does not mean there will be 35,000 completions in the next year.  It depends on the mix of housing units.  Some take longer than others.  We will see something in that order in the next year to 18 months.  There is unmet demand from the last decade or so.  The reasons for that are reasonably well understood and have been debated in many forums.  That demand needs to be caught up on.  It is the view of the Department and my view that increase in supply will alleviate the increase in price, whether on the purchase or rental market.<\/p><p>My view is that increasing supply is a means of alleviating the issue but there are many other policy instruments in Housing for All, which have been discussed in many fora.<\/p><p> I have answered the points made about a cap and housing.

Certainly not negative rental growth and I think that would probably have been unusual.  The Deputy is quite right that in most markets in the world one tends not to see things fall, and certainly in housing markets.  Normally they would increase at least with median income or these types of metrics.  There was definitely a different story during the Celtic tiger between the rental market and the housing market.

I have listened to a great deal of the discussion and I will try not to repeat material that has been discussed.<\/p> <p>  The cost of living is hitting many people hard and inflation has increased to almost 7%.  The cost of living is very uneven in that some people experience its impact much more than others.  For example, when we spoke to officials from the Central Bank they pointed out that rural people, people on fixed incomes and older people are hit hardest by the cost of living.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of packages available ranging between the fuel allowance, the diesel and petrol prices for school buses and so on, health charges and electricity charges to support people in different ways.

Have they identified other ways to ensure that future measures focus on supporting the people who are hit the hardest by the cost of living and price increases?<\/p> <p>  A lot of focus has been on energy being the key driver for price increases.  However, Covid restrictions and the subsequent disruption to supplies have caused a lot of price increases.  For example, the scarcity of timber and insulation products increased the price of construction.  At the moment there is much more severe Covid restrictions in China.  Also, a huge volume of business, which amounts to over &euro;20 billion, is conducted between Ireland and China and concerns a whole swathe of goods that range from textiles, machinery, electronics and every kind of a thing.  What consideration is given to the disruption in supply and the price increases that flow from same?  Have the officials measured the effects or taken them into consideration?  For example, Shanghai port is experiencing delays due to Covid restrictions and over 500 vessels are waiting outside many Chinese ports thus the unavailability of materials will have an effect in a range of places across the world and I expect that prices will increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#H01200","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":176,"content":"<p>I will answer from a macroeconomic perspective and I shall answer the last query first.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right.  This time last year and any time before the war or during the winter I would have probably said that economies have re-opened and there is a massive surge in demand for goods, although services are completely restricted so consumption has shifted completely over this way, and that has driven up prices around the world.  At the same time demand is rising but there are supply shortages for the exact reasons that the Deputy has described, which occur today but occurred this time last year, but that we expect the situation to be alleviated.  I refer to things that affect the production of cars and the supply of semi-conductors and, indirectly, the supply of semi-conductors is affected by things like inert or neon gases, which come from Ukraine.  So the same problems that we had last year we are likely to have this year though admittedly for different reasons.  There is a disruption in the global supply chains but whether it is the energy stuff that we talked about earlier or imported goods into the economy a lot of it is completely imported.<\/p><p>It is very difficult, and China&rsquo;s Covid strategy will prolong these disruptions.<\/p><p> Some of the data we have seen, even in today's release in the US, shows there are starting to be reductions in, for example, the price of motor vehicles.  I raise the US data because they are the most current.  There has been a large increase in costs such as those relating to airfares and hospitality, on the services side, and some easing on the goods side.  My personal view is this stuff is still time-bound but, obviously, it is dependent on factors over which we have zero control.  Trucks that may have come from Far East manufacturers as an alternative to ships last year, when ships were constrained by certain port bottlenecks, went through Russia to get to Germany.  Obviously, that is now unavailable to them and it will take time to find alternative solutions.  It is as though sand has been thrown into the cogs; the supply chains have been completely disrupted.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that the issue is being alleviated and that it is time-bound, but the Deputy is quite right that the problem is very acute at present.

It has been in the system since around this time last year.  Goods were declining in price year on year for the guts of a decade, which was curious because the question arises as to whether the prices will eventually fall to zero.  The trends for services, on the other hand, were positive.  If I had showed the committee a chart on inflation, we would see an upward line, not very steep, at about 0.5% per annum.  The trends for services were all positive and those for goods were all negative, but that just abruptly stopped last year as we flipped out of the pandemic because of all these blockages associated with the pandemic, some of which remain, such as the issues in China the Deputy mentioned.  While there is evidence that some of those blockages are easing - I mentioned motor vehicles in the US - our inflation projections completely bake them in.  Non-energy, non-food core inflation will be 4% this year.  These are really high numbers in the context where, as I said, goods prices were trending towards zero, but that is not unique.  Every country is facing it.  In the US, core inflation was 6.2% in the month of April, which is really high.<\/p> <p>  This takes us back to the point we were making earlier, namely, that countries that are not producers of raw materials or fossil fuels are becoming poorer as a whole because the costs of their imports globally are increasing.  It has to be a case of burden-sharing.  We talked about the energy measures earlier.  They were an effort on the part of the Government to target and point at certain imports.  This leads me to the Deputy's first question, about the economic evidence.  He is quite right about the Central Bank research, and OECD research, published in a blog today or yesterday, shows the very same point in a cross-country sense.  Of course, lower income households spend more of their income on staples, as do older and rural cohorts, depending on their energy mix.  The best way to focus on that relates to income.  We should examine income groups and the analysis that is generally based on income.  Most of the analysis we and the Economic Social Research Institute, ESRI, have conducted seeks to find the impact of budgetary measures on various income groups.  It is correct to say older households are more severely affected, but not all older households will be in the first, second or third deciles.  In fact, what we should care about is the intersection between low income and older age.  The evidence to date, based on the analysis of the budget we carried out, the analysis the ESRI conducted on the February and March package and further analysis we have done on all of that, has consistently shown that the highest gains from these measures have always been in the lower income groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Could further measures be identified to focus on the people who are hardest hit to alleviate their difficulties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00600","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>I will hand over to my colleagues to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>In the package of measures that was introduced in February and, subsequently, in April, the focus has been to use the fuel allowance to provide targeted support.

The key with trying to implement these measures in February and subsequently was to do so quickly.  The energy credit was a broad-based payment that provided some support to everybody.  Given that the legislation had been published, increasing it to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT, or about &euro;176 net, could be done quickly.  The legislation had been published and could be enacted quickly, with the funding put in place.  Likewise, the fuel allowance was a means of quickly getting these bullet payments, of &euro;125 in March and &euro;100 subsequently, to people in the lower income deciles.  In the budget, there was a &euro;5 per week increase for all working-age payments and pension payments, and there was an increase in the qualified child payment of &euro;2 for under-12s and &euro;3 for over-12s.  Furthermore, there were increases in the living alone allowance and the working family payment.  These were all put through SWITCH, the distributional analysis, which showed they were effective in providing income to the lower income deciles.  That is the type of support that can be very effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":185,"content":"<p>The four deciles in the middle do not qualify for social welfare or the fuel allowance.

There is a very significant problem, as is reflected in the price of diesel as well.  The Government has responded through the various measures relating to excise, whereby it reduced excise on petrol by 20 cent and diesel by 15 cent in order to alleviate those problems.  There are limits to what the Government can do within that, given there is an excise directive that imposes a minimum level to which the State must adhere.  The Minister for Finance, in considering this and making these changes, was conscious that excise is a considerable revenue-raiser that is used to pay for the running of the State, so a balance had to be struck in trying to improve the circumstances of people who were affected by the rises in fuel costs while recognising, as I think everyone does, that it is impossible to alleviate the issue altogether.  That was the balance he decided to apply.

If I am following up on things that have already been talked about, the witnesses should not hesitate to let me know.<\/p><p>One of the issues I would like to get a view on is inflation, on which there is a lot of discussion at the moment.  What we frequently hear is around a wage-price spiral.  We see that energy prices and the reopening of supply chains are driving inflation rather than wages.  I saw a graph in the <i>Financial Times <\/i>this week that showed hourly earnings in the private sector back as far as 2015 in the eurozone in comparison to the United States and Britain.  It showed that, since 2020, wage growth was almost stagnant in the eurozone but there were good gains in the US and Britain.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views in regard to evidence or lack thereof of a wage-price spiral.  If wages are not the driver, would an inflation-adjusted wage increase not be of benefit?  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#K00100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>It is an excellent question.  Where do I start?  The wage data in Ireland for the last year or two are borderline impossible to interpret.  When we get down to averages, we had 600,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in 2020 and they are all, comparatively speaking, lower-paid, part-time workers.  Therefore, we get this massive mechanical shoot-up in the average wage because we are dividing the wages of those who are still in work, which is comparatively higher, by a much smaller number.  It is very hard to interpret.  However, although they are not the official data on wages, which, as I said, are completely messed up, some data have been published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which looked at tax records for people who were in jobs in subsequent quarters, and it is almost controlling for everyone who was on PUP and similar payments.  As of the fourth quarter of last year, quarter on quarter, from the third quarter of last year, on a like-for-like basis, wage growth was of the order of 6%.  Therefore, in Ireland, for those within work over the past year or two, wage growth was actually quite strong.<\/p> <p>  That probably explains what we have seen on the income tax side, given it has been difficult to explain what has gone on with income tax in Ireland, where there was near double-digit growth last year.  Is that because of people coming back into work who lost employment because of the pandemic, or is it because of wage growth for people who are working and have continued to work?  There is no easy answer to that.  However, if we look at what happened in 2020, when we have this huge fall in employment but income tax only fell by a tiny amount, it probably speaks to those who left employment and were supported by the PUP being comparatively lower paid and, therefore, paying comparatively less tax.  Therefore, it would stand to reason that when they return to work, there would not be a huge tax dividend, which then probably speaks to the fact that if income tax in particular shot up last year, it must be to do with wage growth within the economy.<\/p> <p>  In my view, even though the national official statistics do no not show it, there is evidence from Revenue data and the like that there was quite strong wage growth in the economy.  Of course, at the same time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut across Mr. O'Connor.

However, yes, it was absolutely tilted towards those sectors where profits and revenues were growing, particularly the multinational sector.  That would make sense.  If a firm is making an awful lot of profits, it is reasonable that there is a return to the people working in it.<\/p> <p>  To get to the core of the Deputy&rsquo;s question about wage-price spirals, that is the economic question of the age, namely, what do we do in an economy where there is comparatively high inflation?  All economies are quite different at the moment and the components of inflation are very different.  If we look at US data, there is a very particular story over there.  Core inflation is through the roof and is up at about 6% or 6.25%.  That is why we have seen the Federal Reserve moving and if it really wants to control it, there is probably a considerable degree of work, if we consider what market expectations are for interest rates at the very end of the year.  By the way, the US labour market is super-tight and unemployment rates are at 3.5% or something like that.  In the UK, it is kind of a similar story, which is one of pretty strong core inflation and super-low unemployment.  In the euro area, there is a bit more slack in the labour market.  That said, unemployment rates are at record lows and it is just that, historically, it has been a little higher.  However, core inflation is certainly not biting to the same extent yet in the euro area, although it is definitely picking up and, in Ireland, is expected to be of the order of about 4% this year.<\/p> <p>  If we think about inflation as a whole, there are the energy products we import and the goods we import and, basically, pretty much all goods are imported into Ireland, certainly consumer goods, although some food is produced and consumed domestically.  Then, there are services, which encompass many different things and, within services, wages account for perhaps two thirds to three quarters of costs.  Therefore, if, as a rule, we are trying to ensure that everybody should be compensated for the full price increase, that clearly goes straight into the costs of firms and, ultimately, comes out the other end.  To slightly simplify this, we can think of a market where things are quite competitive, say, fruit or if we want to buy a carrot in a market.  If some cost upstream goes into it, whether it is a fertiliser price increase or something else, the price that the customer pays increases quite quickly.  That is the wage-price spiral.<\/p> <p>  Where does that actually lead us?  If I am to pre-empt the Deputy&rsquo;s next question of what should happen with wages, it is a very difficult one to give an answer to.  Everybody tries to compare the situation today to the 1970s but it was a very different situation.  We have independent monetary institutions now, central banks with inflation targets did not really exist to the same extent back then and we had economies that were way more energy-intensive.  At the same time, we had a lot of economies where wages were simply indexed, so it completely did chase inflation.  Basically, we had increased wages, which increased costs and increased prices, which again increased wages, and that was the wage-price spiral.  That led to super-high inflation, really low output growth, in some cases recessions and very high unemployment.<\/p> <p>  I do not have an answer for the Deputy as to what should happen with wages.  I would probably say that in normal times, and we are not in normal times, we would expect wages to increase at least with productivity and some compensation for price increases, but I am not going to say that increasing it for all of us would not have an impact on inflation in a spiralling sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>I will not be able to quote Mr. O'Connor the next time I am discussing this in an interview.

It now looks likely that the ECB will hike interest rates in July whereas for a very long period &ndash; obviously, this was before the war in Ukraine - the ECB was clear it was not going to increase interest rates.  If we look back to previous times, the ECB increased rates in July 2007, when we entered the global financial crisis, and it also did it in July 2011, when we entered the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.  This is something we discussed with the Central Bank officials and it was interesting to hear their response.  I have a fear that the ECB will decide to hike interest rates in the middle of war and of high inflation which is primarily due to energy prices.<\/p><p>I would be interested to hear Mr. O'Connor's view.

We have revised down our growth forecasts, as is well known, by something like 2.25% but are still posting reasonable figures in the region of 4% for modified domestic demand.  Admittedly, some of it is affected by the year-on-year comparison.  We are not in that space in a baseline sense.<\/p> <p>  I refer to what could happen with much higher energy prices.  Energy markets are extremely volatile.  At one point yesterday, gas prices fell to 11 pence before quickly going back up to 146 pence.  I was out watching my daughter play football.  It was a warm day but full of wind, so people were not purchasing gas on spot markets.  It goes to show that minor changes in the situation in Ukraine and Russia or by policymakers in Europe with regard to sanctions will have large impacts, positive or negative, on energy prices.  It is difficult to say but as the prices go up and that affects inflation, obviously there will be a spill-over to growth.  We have put that into the stability programme update in our scenario analysis.<\/p> <p>  On interest rates, I have to be careful what I say because monetary policy is completely independent so I will not give any strong views on that.  The expectation is the ECB will move.  Markets have priced in something of the order of 0.75% or 75 basis points before the end of the year.  In the US, markets expect interest rates to go to something like 2.75% to 3%, while in the UK it is of the order of 2%.  According to people who base their careers on this, European interest rates will still be considerably lower by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  There is another concept, which I am sure any central bankers present would love to talk about, called the neutral rate of inflation.  That is the one that is neither stimulatory nor contractionary.  People have to estimate it and some make careers out of it.  If the ECB gets to 0.75% by the end of the year, it will be considerably below any estimate I have seen of the neutral rate of inflation, which means the interest rates in Europe will still be expansionary rather than contractionary.  They would have to go much higher, up to where the UK is, or even the US.  I do not expect interest rates, given what markets are expecting, to have a significant contractionary impact on the economy unless things change hugely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#L00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":197,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

It concerns fuel costs, as well as consequent delivery costs and inflation on goods.  The gentleman in question was a haulier who wished to avail of the diesel rebate scheme.  He has a number of lorries on the road and purchased around 100,000 l of fuel in the first three months of the year.  The difficulty is the scheme is set up with the requirement that the haulier must purchase fuel in units of 2,000 l or more.  This company's tank is 2,500 l.  Sometimes with a contingency order, when the delivery arrives, the tank will not take 2,000 l.  This means the delivery does not qualify for the rebate.  If the lorry is on the road and running low, it may pull into a garage and use the DCI card or whatever to fill up.  Why is the scheme set up in this way?  Could it be altered in favour of small businesses, many of which are struggling with rising energy, fuel and other costs, by taking into account fuel bought on trade account or by debit card?<\/p> <p>  When was the &euro;100 per week hauliers support scheme first paid out and to when was it backdated?

They all have been excellent questions, like the Deputy's.  All these energy prices are imported, so there is this massive shock to the Irish economy.  Gas prices on wholesale markets in early March were ten times above their average price.  They are currently approximately three times above it, so there has been a threefold increase to energy suppliers' inputs.  Unfortunately for all of us, that is reflected in retail prices.<\/p> <p>  The Government has made its policy decisions.  The effort was to try to alleviate some of those prices for everybody to some extent and then to target additional supports for lower income groups, such as fuel allowances and so forth.  I am not 100% sure if I can say much more than that.  Controlling prices has come up previously and I had to apologise to one of the Deputy's committee colleagues earlier.  It is definitely not my realm.  I am not familiar with those legislative powers or what could be done.  All I can say is that somewhere someone has to bear these costs.  Unfortunately, energy suppliers or energy producers elsewhere in the world are benefitting and economies that import this stuff, like ours, are poorer as a result.  What does one do?  Does one try to compensate the entire economy for all of these increases?  That is one option.

The Government has decided to target lower income households through the social welfare system, particularly through the fuel allowance and the two lump sum payments that have been made under that scheme, and then to provide broad-based support through the energy credit and the reductions that have been made on the taxation side, which bring us through to the budget.  It is a significant intervention.  When one totals all the interventions, they come to just over &euro;1 billion.  They certainly go some way towards addressing the issue.  The Government has set out the position that trying to compensate completely for all the price rises in energy would be a huge burden for the Exchequer to bear.

We must think about where the money comes from.  The Government is currently running a deficit this year and is forecasting a very modest surplus next year.  However, as we said in the stability programme update, if energy prices go back to the levels they were at in early March, and it is not inconceivable that they would do so - there are various scenarios in which one could see that happening - then next year's surplus is gone.  The surplus would be gone simply because of higher energy prices, higher inflation in the economy and the impact they have on output.  That is without any more policy measures by the Government.  Meanwhile, the interest rate environment is completely changing.  We have seen what happened with the Bank of England last week, and with the Federal Reserve a week or two before that.  Irish bond yields which for a long time were either at zero, marginally below zero or close to zero are very close to 2% right now.  The Italian bond yields are up at around 3%.  We are seeing a big pick-up.  The so-called \"free money\" era is gone.  Basically, it is getting much more expensive for states to finance deficits.  If we want to do more, it will have to be paid for in higher debt and higher interest and that is an important consideration in the context of policy decisions and policy choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I welcome the 20% reduction in public transport fares for the people who can benefit from it.

Both these initiatives are worthwhile.  The witnesses have all done work on this and I know they are aware of these aspects.  The Departments have done excellent work on this, in fairness.  My impression of the budget cycle, though, and it might be unfair, is that gender equality budgeting and well-being indicators are still somewhat a satellite element in the context of the work being done.  They are in the process of being implemented.  When we talk about budgets, the SWITCH system is still central to the decisions we are making.

Europe Day marks the anniversary of the historic Schuman declaration, a day to reflect on the strides taken to bring peace and prosperity to the continent of Europe.  The war in Ukraine highlights that the ideals behind the setting up of what became the European Union are still very much necessary.

We are joined by Mr. Leo Galvin, representing Donegal, by Ms Prachi Agrawal representing D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and by Mr. James O'Brien, representing Wexford.

Is on&oacute;ir m&oacute;r &eacute; a bheith anseo inniu chun labhairt libh.  Over the course of this year, the European Year of Youth, young people across Europe have been given a voice.  It is a long-awaited chance to have a large scale input on European policy and legislation.  Having attended several of these consultative events, I must say that the energy was electric.  There was a feeling of \"Oh my, the European Union wants our opinion!\"  It was an incredible once-off opportunity but what if it was not a once-off?  What if the young people of Ireland were consulted more?  What if the decisions the European Union makes had the input of young people more often?  Day in, day out decisions are made and many of them affect young people's lives.  As we sit in our homes and schools, the desire to have our say is growing.  Organisations such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, SpunOut, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, and many more have the aim of allowing young people to voice their concerns.  From lowering public transport costs for every young person in Ireland to gaining a seat on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, their achievements have been earned through years of work.  This clearly demonstrates that young people want a say and an input into the decisions that affect them.<\/p> <p>  The Schuman Declaration, which we are here today to celebrate, has inevitably led us to this point.  A coal and steel community became a legislative and policy-forming coalition where everyone has a say.  The benefits of this have been felt throughout the decades as it responded to the problems voiced by its members, especially in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Many young people would not be here without the EU's open border policy, finding jobs that can sustain them abroad.  I certainly would not be here if my mother had not been able to work in Ireland when she moved here from France.  Many young people take public transport, which relies on funding from the EU.  Motorways, railways and even infrastructure were built with EU funds, not to mention the transport schemes in rural areas.  Even the clothes I wear today would not have made it into the EU without the many trade agreements the Union has made across the world.<\/p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as aird comhalta&iacute; an choiste agus t&aacute; suil agam gur bhain siad luach as an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; againn inniu.

After 50 years of our membership of the European Union, I reflect on how immensely this country has progressed because of it.  We have grown from a country of political and economic turbulence to a nation with remarkable opportunities and overall standard of living.  However, as times progress and change, we must adapt and maintain that level of remarkability for generations to come.<\/p> <p>  This generation has grown up during the age of uncountable historic events and there is no doubt this has had a monumental impact on the way we perceive the world around us.  From living through a global pandemic to the current climate crisis, we have grown up looking at people suffering and the planet dying from a very young age.  It does not help that we are growing up during a time of rapid technological progression and the rise of social media, being exposed to an abundance of content before we can even create our own opinions.<\/p> <p>  I will talk about how all of these issues are closely interlinked and how certain EU policies could potentially solve not one but many of these problems.  On a European level, climate change has been a core topic of discussion and some amazing initiatives have been introduced.  The European Green Deal, for example, aims to transform Europe into a carbon-neutral continent by 2050.  Some funding provided by the EU has been used in fantastic ways, including to restore many bogs and in agricultural activity, but a lot more can be done.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 European semester country report for Ireland stated that transport and building were hindering our progress towards becoming carbon neutral.  Using funding for accessible and affordable transport and green urban development could have a massive and positive impact on our progress.<\/p> <p>  As students, one of the best and most beneficial resources for us is education.  Funding science sectors that investigate and develop reliable renewable energy sources, supporting students of all demographics to pursue environmentally-inclined careers and providing equal opportunities to students to keep different perspectives in the climate conversation would enable us to contribute to change from a young age and not feel helpless about our future.  The benefits of education do not stop at climate change.  The digital education action plan is a brilliant EU policy initiative that integrates technology into education.  We noticed during the pandemic how crucial technology was to us.  It allowed people to make a living, receive an education, stay connected and enabled the entire global market to still function.  Technology has proved to be integral to our lives, especially those of this generation, yet there are many cases where the digital world has affected us in a harmful or detrimental way because of its growing dangers.  Integrating technology into first, second and third level education through accessible and affordable equipment, digitally trained staff and inclusive and user-friendly lessons are just some of the many ways to allow children to understand the online world from a young age, thereby allowing us to feel confident in using technology because it is so prevalent in today's society.  Technology could genuinely be the future if it is kept safe and used properly.<\/p> <p>  As I said, everything is closely related and linked.  Quality education empowers students to explore opportunities and develop interests in fields that are necessary and useful in the future, such as climate change and technology.  This is just one of the many knock-on effects the implementation of certain EU policies would have on this generation and the population as a whole.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Prachi Agrawal"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":280,"content":"<p>Dia daoibh agus t&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an bhf&aacute;ilte a cuireadh romham freastal os comhair an Choiste um Ghn&oacute;tha&iacute; an Aontais Eorpaigh.  As a member of Wexford Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Recently, I was lucky enough to attend the 25th annual European Youth Parliament national session in Cork.  I and many others each worked with a group of like-minded individuals on a committee to research, discuss and form a resolution.  The committees debated and voted at general assembly to decide whether the resolutions should pass.  A wide variety of topics was discussed, including the housing crisis, unpaid internships, artificial intelligence, or AI, the introduction of tighter restrictions on gender-based violence, the lowering of the voting age to 16 years and many other topics.  The European Youth Parliament has proved to me beyond doubt that every young person in Europe deserves to have his or her voice heard when it comes to major issues such as these.  These issues will ultimately shape the future that we are expected to and eager to lead.<\/p> <p>  While Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is an amazing tool for its members that serves to help young have their voices heard where they otherwise might not be, it is only representatives of young people's voices and the opportunity is not available to everyone.  For many young people, having any kind of influence on the issues that directly affect their lives seems totally impossible.<\/p> <p>  Young people face problems that are not being addressed nearly as much as they could or should be and that will only grow exponentially over time.  If young people had a platform to have their voices heard on issues such as prejudice and harassment towards members of the LGBTQ community, the way the education system and school curriculum are laid out and the housing crisis, it would go a long way to reduce friction between young people and those who have the influence to decide their future.  Given the atrocities taking place in Ukraine, a lack of friction is exactly what we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. James O'Brien"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le James as a r&aacute;iteas uile a bh&iacute; iontach gairid ach bh&iacute; na point&iacute; iontach soil&eacute;ir ann.

It is great when people want to listen.<\/p><p>Mr. O'Brien can correct me if I am wrong, but I get a sense he is saying a lot is being said but nobody is doing anything about it, or at least there is the impression nothing is being done about his concerns.  Have any of the witnesses put any thought into what sort of structured forums need to be put in place, not just on an EU basis, but more particularly on an Ireland basis and a local basis, whether in County Wexford or Dublin?  The witnesses will move on.  They will be elected to the D&aacute;il and will be Ministers in due course.  What sort of forums need to be put in place ensure that those coming up through the organisation in five or ten years' time can actually see the issues that are being raised and can track that it is actually being put in place and they are not just getting warm words from politicians about this?<\/p><p> Ms Agrawal's speech was particularly informed.  It would not have been out of place in the European Parliament.  However, that is not always the case for people of Ms Agrawal's generation.  Does she believe there is a dearth of information, especially about European issues, whether through formal education or any of the organisations she is involved in?  Would she like to see more information about how the EU works and how all three of the witnesses could influence those decisions?  If so, how could that best be achieved?  There is no point in us saying nice things and asking the questions.  The most important thing we can take out of today's meeting is for the witnesses give us substantive things that we can work on.

I am really interested in EU affairs, policies and initiatives that have been taken because they affect me.  They affect many people, but some do not know what is affecting them.  The engagement could be done through councils and entities that have children sitting on them, have young people voicing their concerns about policies, educating and spreading awareness on what the EU is doing for us and how we can contribute to change.  It would be extremely helpful if young people had a voice in European affairs and education on European affairs.  As a young person, education is one of the most important things for me.

When President Macron embarked on the future of Europe dialogue, there was a certain dryness about it.  There was a certain staleness about the notion that we were going to look at the institutions, how they operate and perhaps consider majority voting and so on.  I think that has changed because of the invasion of Ukraine.  The idea of Europe and the values of Europe have been re-looked at, with countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia applying for EU membership.<\/p> <p>  My first question concerns the idea of Europe that the founders of the EU had, post-war and after centuries of conflict.

I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' perspectives on that.<\/p> <p>  My second question builds on Deputy Richmond's question.  How well did the outreach to young people, in this outreach process, work?  Obviously, the witnesses are very well-informed individuals.

I had a meeting yesterday in the estate where I live.  It was one of the first issues that people brought up with regard to drug dealing, crime and their impact.  I could not see how that would not be brought up during the entirety of what is meant to be engagement with all citizens throughout Europe.  There is an abject failure, not only to deal with young people, but to deal with large sections of society.<\/p> <p>  We are engaging with the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g who are interested.  It is how we engage those who are not interested.  People are distanced from politics in this day and age.  They are definitely distanced from European politics.  The fact that our guests all know the constituent institutions within the European Union makes them complete outliers.  I doubt most people on the street know what the European Council, the European Commission or the European Parliament are.  Ireland at this stage is probably different from it was ten years ago when we were dealing with austerity, which was seen to have been imposed to some extent by Europe.  People are happy with Europe and see it as a good thing, not only in terms of the peace project but also because it is the means of necessary co-operation at this point in time.<\/p> <p>  The members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g have already gone through the issues that are important to them.  They spoke about social media.  We could get into the rights and wrongs of social media companies.  Europe has made some sort of moves with regard to taking them to task.  What can be done, in real terms, to reach other people?  How do we interest the disinterested, especially young people?  At the Conference on the Future of Europe, we heard that its engagement would continue in future.  This is engagement of which the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g were unaware.  What can be done to involve our guests and other people?  I said there would be a bit of ponderous meandering.<\/p> <p>  I have other questions on European politics and what should be happening on a couple of the major issues.  Climate change is an issue throughout Europe.  People became very worried about Marine Le Pen.  Climate change is almost a weapon for the likes of Ms Le Pen but that will be the case until we can show that the state will step up to the mark throughout Europe, as opposed to putting further pressure on young people.  My view is that there needs to be a step change in that respect.  What is the view of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's members?  Will they pick a couple of the major issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#E00700","speaker":"1498"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":310,"content":"<p>With regard to the Deputy's first question on how to interest the disinterested, I do not think that people are not interested.

In junior cycle, civic, social and political education, CSPE, was a one-hour class every week.  Sometimes, we did national news and at other times we talked about recent news stories but it was not a set curriculum in which we had discussions about the European Union, the UN or policies that affect this generation.<\/p> <p>  Only certain people take either politics and society or economics, where the European Union is discussed in that sense, as leaving certificate subjects.  Interesting this generation would be just showing it information.  You would then naturally find people who did not think they were interested but when they have been given the source through education and have to get to school and sit through and listen to it, you would find many of them are interested.  I do not know how we would interest the disinterested but I keep bringing up education because it is very important.  Education on the European Union and international affairs is crucial.

We have seen school strikes and people on the street saying what needs to be done in rural areas to amplify marginalised voices.  We then talk about social media and younger children of 11 or 12 years going on to social media apps such as Instagram and the apps completely changing their view on the world and how they perceive themselves.  A lot of things are detrimental to this education but there is also a flip side to it in that climate change has taught us so much about the environment and the world we live in and how we can change it.

It is more about delving into the issue of people who are mildly interested.  To get those people interested, aside from bribery, one could show them what the European Union has done for us.  Many people do not even know about roaming charges.  That was a massive piece of legislation and work done by the European Union.  Not many young people are aware that this happened or that they existed.  It is a matter of education.  One cannot force a person into something in which he or she is not interested, but if you just tell them - I do not want to say it like this - the bare minimum, that can fuel their interest further.  We believe the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and CSPE programmes are flawed because they do not complete the outcome they were designed to achieve.  It is more a matter of considering those programmes and trying to change them.<\/p><p> As regards the Deputy's second question, one of the major topics currently for young people is transport.  It has a lot to do with independence.  In rural areas in particular, there is much discussion of climate change and going green, but if, in a virtuous attempt to do something, one takes away a person's ability to go anywhere, I cannot see how that benefits anyone.  It would almost be better to target urban areas because although rural areas have a lot of emissions, targeting transport there is not a good idea, especially considering they have such a deficit in public transport.<\/p><p> I refer to general supports in schools in the context of mental health skills in particular, such as in respect of panic attack crises.  I will not bring in the issue of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, because it is far too large an issue.  There is a need for general supports.

I could go on and on about how those two years impacted me personally, but also my generation.  First, I referred in my opening remarks to technology being such an integral part of the pandemic, both positively and negatively.  Social media and the Internet are so useful to me because I can stay connected and updated about things that are happening around the world.  I started getting interested in politics and global affairs because I saw all these movements, such as Black Lives Matter, and policies that were happening all over the world while I was just at home, isolating or doing school online, and I thought there was something more that could be done.  The pandemic was definitely an eye-opener for many people, but it was not the best for the mental health of people around the world.  We were at home without social contact.  We were not meeting up with anyone.  We were at home for the majority of the time, on our phones and almost overdosing on social media, scrolling for hours on end and almost getting indoctrinated by the screen.  When we got back to school, one could see how we had changed.  We were a lot quieter and shyer because we had not had social contact in two years.  There were added mental health pressures caused by being at home for two years, not knowing oneself as much and feeling that we almost missed our teenage years in that sense.  It was a really difficult transition.  On a European level, more could have been done in respect of mental health awareness.  That was the biggest thing we probably needed at the time - someone or something to tell us that mental health can get bad and that is okay.  There is a need for support systems because it is difficult to go tell a teacher at school that your mental health is bad but it is even more difficult to be at home wondering what to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Prachi Agrawal"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>I think the next question was what are our guests' two biggest worries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#F00700","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>Yes.

In certain countries, such as, I believe, Scotland, the turnout for that age group jumped massively.  In Austria, over time, turnout lowered slightly for young people but it has continued to be quite high.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#F01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Galvin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":330,"content":"<p>And your two biggest worries?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#G00200","speaker":"1664"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":331,"content":"<p>Yes, sorry.

It is brilliant to hear real voices talking about the real issues.  It makes a pleasant change.  I represent Wicklow.  A large event was organised by Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g last Friday and was attended by more than 100 young people.  They broke into workshops, and I had the privilege of sitting in on some of them and hearing about some of the real issues.  It is great to hear the witnesses articulate many of the issues raised at that meeting.  The issues included everything from mental health, the illegal invasion of Ukraine, hate speech, climate and biodiversity to drug use and a lot of other issues.  The meeting was in line with what the witnesses identified as the real issues.<\/p> <p>  I want to pick up on a couple of points.  Reducing the voting age to 16 is something I firmly believe should happen.  The case of Scotland was raised by Mr. Galvin.  The level of engagement by young people, the education built around that and the turnout on the initial day was fascinating to watch.<\/p> <p>  A significant piece of work was done in Leinster House in the previous D&aacute;il term when a Bill tabled by my one of my colleagues, Senator Fintan Warfield, to reduce the voting age to 16 worked its way through the Seanad.  Unfortunately, it did not progress.  To see the level of engagement by young people in that process was fascinating.  Having the witnesses before us today shows there is a level of knowledge.  In my view, the witnesses are the very reason the age should be reduced to 16.  That is not to be patronising; I am saying this because they are so articulate in terms of the issues.  From an educational perspective, getting young people engaged in decision-making is something that should happen.  <\/p> <p>  To follow up on the question of whether the witnesses think the voting age should be reduced, would reducing the voting age to 16 force the people who make legislation at European and State level sit up and listen to people like the witnesses?  I have heard from young people that they speak, but there is a perception that the people who make the legislation are not listening.  Would reducing the voting age help to change that and ensure the voices of young people would be heard, listened to and acted upon?<\/p> <p>  Over the past three months we have seen the fallout from the horrific invasion of Ukraine.  That has also shaped a debate in this State around Irish neutrality.  We have predominantly middle-aged people talking about our neutrality.  If a decision was taken to drop our neutrality, the young people who are not making that decision would be affected.  It would be fascinating to hear a young person's perspective on neutrality.  The witnesses are the sort of young people who, in such a scenario, would be sent to the front line in a war situation as, unfortunately, we are seeing in Ukraine.  I would like to hear their views on whether young people are engaged with and aware of the debate on neutrality.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  They have done very well today.  The issues they have identified on behalf of their peers are consistent with issues raised by many of the people I had the pleasure of meeting the other day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#G01400","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":343,"content":"<p>I stand by what I said about lowering the voting age.  I had not thought about whether it would have a knock-on effect when it comes to people our age being listened to, which it definitely would.  It is something to take into account.  There are many layers that need to be considered when thinking about lowering the voting age.  I would be more in favour of lowering the voting age having heard what the Deputy has said.<\/p> <p>  With regard to neutrality, I consider myself a pacifist.  I am a massive advocate for non-violence.  What is happening with Putin and Ukraine is unprecedented in the 21st century.  It is appalling.  That goes without saying.  However, where a diplomatic solution is possible, which I think it is in most cases, or at least should be, neutrality is necessary or at least helpful in fostering that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#G01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. James O'Brien"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>Lowering the voting age would certainly force politicians to consider a young person's point of view and recognise young people's problems, because if such a change was made to the law, it would encompass a large portion of the electorate.

Warmongering is not something that is positive.  In our country&rsquo;s history we have experienced what war and fighting result in.  It is not long ago that we had the effects of a war, or an unconventional war, occurring on the Irish isle.  I would strongly say that Ireland should remain neutral in all senses of the word.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#G01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Leo Galvin","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":346,"content":"<p>I completely agree with what Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Galvin said.

I support lowering the voting age.  That is all I can say on that for now.<\/p> <p>  Neutrality, again, is something I feel extremely strongly about.  In the 21st century, talking about going off to war is dystopian.  It should not be happening.  However, if it is, Ireland can help in many other ways, such as through immigration policy.  We have accepted many Ukrainians into the country, which is fantastic.  Helping in those aspects is much more helpful than, as Mr. Galvin said, warmongering.  I believe that neutrality is important to Ireland as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Prachi Agrawal"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Hopefully, our guests&rsquo; voices on that will be heard.

I am sure it is a little intimidating but hopefully they have relaxed more into it.  It is very interesting to draw out their opinions on so many issues, including climate change, neutrality, the voting age and so forth.  It has been a learning exercise for us.  We get the message loud and clear that the voices of young people need to be heard and that is not quite happening at the moment.<\/p> <p>  We are celebrating 50 years of Ireland&rsquo;s membership in the European Union this week.  We had Europe Day on Monday.  The presentations are part of the week-long schedule of activity.  We had a comprehensive debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday about Europe Day and what Europe means to us all.  It is clear that membership of the European Union has transformed Irish society.  We joined in 1972.  Looking back on it, and I do not remember the 1950s and the period prior to membership, but Ireland was a very dark place at the time.  The European Union dragged Ireland kicking and screaming into the 20th and 21st centuries.  That is something we need to be conscious of.<\/p> <p>  The European Union espouses liberal democratic values and tolerance.  The vision and ideals of the European Union must relate to young people, in particular.  When we consider the Brexit vote in the UK in 2016 which led the UK to leave the European Union, it is interesting that research shows that young people voted in very large numbers to remain in the European Union and it was the older people who wanted to leave.  That tells a message as well.  Even in regard to rule of law issues, when the Polish Government introduced LGBTIQ+ exclusion zones, the European Union was very strong in saying that it was just not acceptable.  Countries have to adhere to the values and ideals of the European Union if they want to be a member of the Union.  I just put that out to our guests and hope they agree that the European Union is particularly good for young people in respect of the values that it espouses.  I hope they will agree with me on that.  <\/p> <p>  On climate change, which Ms Agrawal and others mentioned, the European Union is to the forefront in dealing with it.  Ms Agrawal mentioned the European Green Deal and so forth.  That is just one issue.  Countries such as Russia, China and India are not pulling their weight in regard to dealing with climate change, which is a big worry.  However, the European Union is to the forefront of that.  <\/p> <p>  Do our guests agree that the European Union is actually good for young people?  Where do they see themselves going in the future?  Would any of them consider a political career, for want of a better word, joining a political party or becoming actively involved in politics?  They have taken big steps in coming here today and becoming involved in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Would any of them pursue politics formally and perhaps run for office in a local council or the D&aacute;il some day?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#H00400","speaker":"1552"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":349,"content":"<p>Is that an offer?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022051100002#H00500","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":350,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy&rsquo;s first question on the values of the European Union, I certainly agree with them.  Ireland is much more of a moderate country, politically speaking.  We do not have many extremist parties or extremist views.

As such, I very much agree with the values of the European Union.<\/p> <p>  On the second question as to whether we are considering some sort of role in politics, I would not be certain of it.  Politics is a very complicated field to get into and especially to begin with.  The world of political parties is an incredibly difficult one to navigate as well.

I would perhaps skew more in favour of therapy or counselling, considering the mental health deficit that more or less everyone is experiencing, especially in the wake of the pandemic and everything happening in Ukraine and the world over, essentially.  Helping people with that would be my main priority.  The way we perceive the world around us impacts on our mental health.

I spoke to someone I had not seen in a number of years who had entered the seminary as a priest.  He did not stay for too long and only did a couple of years.  When I asked him about it he said he did not have a vocation but his mother had one for him.  He realised he did not have it himself.  It has to come from within.  There are many types of callings in politics.  There are advisers in the background and people involved in communications.  Without telling the witnesses who know so much what to do, perhaps they could put their toes in the water by checking out student union politics.  This would give them a flavour and taste for it.

I returned because it is wonderful the witnesses are here.<\/p> <p>  I have several questions that are not connected.  A bugbear of mine has been the lack of law on the curriculum at second level.  Until a few years ago I was trying to demystify the law in second level schools with the public access to law programme.  Do the witnesses agree it is a shame it is not on the State curriculum?  The function of a proper legal system is part of the democratic process <\/p> <p>  I know the witnesses are discerning and they have the undoubted capacity but do they have the time to analyse, assess and differentiate between advocates of various methods of how to tackle climate change?  I have not met a politician who is against tackling climate change.  I am not politicising it and I will not say what party I or anyone else is in.  It can be a generalisation.  Do the witnesses have time to drill down a little bit?  They are leaders.  Some people say they are totally in favour of tackling climate change but might be utterly against any imposition of carbon tax or considering water as a finite resource, even among the most well-off.  There are people with the genuinely held view, with which I do not agree, that cutting sod turf should not be stopped.  They say they are totally in favour of tackling climate change but that sod turf should remain.  I do not want the witnesses to tell me the differential results of it but have they had an opportunity to drill down behind the slogan on tackling climate change and look at what people want to do in this respect?  I am not necessarily speaking about party politics but individuals.  There is a wide sphere of approaches to this biggest challenge facing humanity.  I would love to get the views of the witnesses on this.

I welcome members and viewers who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Reform, and Taoiseach.  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the disabled drivers and passengers scheme with the former chair and a former member of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.

Dr. McDonagh will make some brief opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session from members.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to privilege because we cannot malign or draw attention to anybody outside the House who cannot answer for himself or herself.

The scheme was extended in 1979 to include disabled passengers with severe disabilities, and this included babies and children who had severe permanent mobility disability and who fulfilled the strict medical criteria.  In 1990, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA, was established by the Department of Finance to review individuals whose application for the primary medical certificate, PMC, was unsuccessful at local HSE level.<br\/><br\/>Section 92 of the Finance Act of 1989 enabled the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for repayment of excise, road tax and VAT in respect of vehicles used or driven by persons who are severely and permanently disabled.  In 1994, the disabled drivers and disabled passengers regulations introduced the six medical criteria.  The regulations state &quot;the eligibility on medical grounds of disabled persons who are severely and permanently disabled shall be assessed by reference to any one or more of the following medical criteria&quot;.  It is important for the committee members to hear these six medical criteria the DDMBA was obliged to use to assess persons appealing the decision not to grant the primary medical certificate.  They were:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;<br \/><br \/>(b) persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to the movement of their lower limbs;<br \/><br \/>(c) persons without both hands or without both arms;<br \/><br \/>(d) persons without one or both legs;<br \/><br \/>(e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;<br \/><br \/>(f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. <\/blockquote> <p>It does not take a medical qualification to know that the language used in these criteria is bizarre and the criteria are very restrictive and exclude many people with genuine, severe and permanent disability from accessing supports.  For example, the person with weakness on one side of the body from a stroke, traumatic brain injury or cerebral palsy may be excluded, as may the person with an amputated or absent upper limb, or a child with physical or neurological and development disorders who needs specialised seating.  These are just some examples among the many people who have genuine disability and require an adapted vehicle but do not qualify under the medical criteria.<br\/><br\/>Persons wishing to avail of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme are first assessed at community level by community doctors.  If deemed ineligible at this level they can appeal the decision to DDMBA.  The board operates independently of the assessment process carried out by the local HSE community medical officers.  The members of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal are medical practitioners appointed by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Health for a serving period of four years.<\/p><p>The adjudicating panel at all clinics comprised the chair and two ordinary board members.  In the years between 2010 and 2019, only between 1% and 8% of persons were successful at appeal hearing with the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.<br\/><br\/>I was appointed chairperson of the DDMBA in 2015 as part of my appointment as a consultant in rehabilitation medicine in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH.  Concerns about the restrictive and inequitable nature of the medical criteria were expressed by my predecessors.  Within the first year of my appointment, at interactions with the Department of Finance I expressed my strongly held view that the scheme needed to be changed.  In June 2018, the board formally wrote to the Department of Finance laying out our concerns about the inflexible and discriminatory nature of the criteria and the need for the scheme to be revised or updated.  We did not receive a reply despite expressing our willingness to discuss further.  I continued to link with the officials in the Department of Finance on a regular basis and meetings were held in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the Department of Finance at which I repeatedly outlined our concerns about the difficulty in fairly applying the criteria and the inequitable nature of the scheme.  The DDMBA also had regular requests from the Office of the Ombudsman in relation to complaints made to it in respect of the decisions taken by the board.<br\/><br\/>In June 2020, the Supreme Court found against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and the Minister for Finance in an appeal brought by two persons who had not been granted a primary medical certificate at an appeal hearing.  The court went on to quash the board&rsquo;s decision and granted a declaration that in applying the criteria set out in regulation 3, in other words the medical criteria, to the appellants the board failed to vindicate their rights under section 92 of the Act.  As stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in an answer to a parliamentary question in July of 2021, &quot;The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.&quot;<br\/><br\/>All assessments for the primary medical certificate were suspended at community level and at the DDMBA following the Supreme Court ruling.  I engaged regularly with the Department of Finance between June and November 2020 via telephone, email and video link.  During this time, I repeatedly expressed my opinion that the Supreme Court decision further vindicated our concerns about the medical criteria and emphasised the importance of progressing rapidly with a comprehensive review of the scheme and complete revision.  During this time, the Minister&rsquo;s official responsible for the scheme had advised me that the Minister planned to have new legislation prepared in time for the Finance Bill 2021.  It is my recollection that in September 2020, his official also spoke to me about a plan to insert the existing medical criteria into primary legislation.  I expressed my view that I and the other board members would not be willing to continue to use the existing medical criteria after the Supreme Court ruling and that I felt this approach was a retrograde step.  The Minister for Finance made the decision to make an amendment to the Finance Bill 2020 to allow for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.  The legislation was amended without any notification to the DDMBA and I only became aware of this change when allied health staff in the National Rehabilitation Hospital informed me in late 2020 that assessments for the primary medical certificate would resume in January 2021.<br\/><br\/>In December 2020, I wrote directly to the Minister for Finance on foot of this change to the legislation to express our concerns about the course of action taken by him.  I also again expressed our concerns about the lack of any significant action on a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers in the six months since the Supreme Court decision.  To quote my letter, &quot;the DDMBA have unanimously stated that they will not be able to assess appellants for the PMC using the same medical criteria whether in legislation or not given the recent Supreme court ruling and their long- held view that the scheme is inequitable&quot;.  The Minister wrote back to me on 21 January 2021 and requested that we reconsider our decision to avoid &quot;directly penalising applicants who otherwise may have their cases successfully appealed by the Medical Board&quot;.  I wrote back to the Minister in March 2021 and advised that we would be willing to resume appeal hearings to clear the backlog from 2020, a period during which public health measures meant that appeal hearings were suspended.  My letter stated:<\/p><blockquote>\t  \t[H]owever, continuing new hearings on the basis of the existing medical criteria after the backlog of current appeals is cleared is fundamentally a wrong way of continuing our work in equity and disability terms for disabled drivers and passengers.  It is very important for the members of the DDMBA to see substantial progress being made towards a new scheme for disabled drivers in a timely manner...  <\/blockquote><p>I asked the Minister to meet with the DDMBA and, to quote my letter again, &quot;to give us reassurance that our concerns are heard and that you fully understand the inadequacies of the current scheme and the urgency of devising a new scheme for disabled drivers&quot;. <br\/><br\/>Members of the DDMBA met the Minister and his officials on 29 March 2021 via video link.  During that meeting, the Minister acknowledged the validity of our concerns about the scheme.  He made a commitment to put time into a process that would yield a scheme that better met the needs of those with disability.  He also talked about the need to deal with this issue in the Finance Bill in December 2021.  He told us he had been in contact with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, to see if his Department would co-chair a review with him in relation to these issues.  He also said that if that Department was not going to participate or did not get back to him quickly, he would get this work under way within his Department.  Overall, the Minister accepted that there were issues and recognised that the board was making decisions that were even more demanding than they should be.  He accepted the validity of the points we made and said he was going to put time into getting the scheme to a better place during the year.  Due to these reassurances, I told the Minister that the DDMBA would be willing to clear the backlog of appellants from 2020, but that we were very reluctant to see new appeals from January 2021 until we saw substantial progress on a new scheme.  I had also indicated this to him in my letter of March 2021.<br\/><br\/>Appeal hearings with the DDMBA resumed in April 2021.  In ensuing months, we worked through the backlog of appellants from 2020 as agreed following our meeting with the Minister.  Between July and September 2021, there were an unprecedented number of complaints made to the Ombudsman in relation to our decisions not to grant primary medical certificates.  There was no demonstrable progress on a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers during this time and I remained in contact with officials in the Department of Finance.<br\/><br\/>The scoping exercise talked of in the autumn of 2020 by Department officials had not yielded anything despite assurances that they would soon forward documents to me in November 2020.  On 2 September 2021, more than five months after our meeting with the Minister, I wrote again to the Minister requesting an update on progress towards a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers.  On 9 September 2021, I spoke to a Department official responsible for the scheme and he admitted that there had been little or no progress.  On 14 October 2021, having received no indication of any significant progress on a new scheme 16 months after the Supreme Court ruling, I wrote to the Minister giving notice of my intention to resign on 11 November 2021 when the last appeals clinic was scheduled to clear the cohort from 2020.  As I stated in my resignation letter, as a medical professional who in my clinical role cares for people with disability and makes every effort to advocate on their behalf, I could no longer participate in a scheme that is unfair and denies assistance to people with genuine disability.  I remained in post until 30 November to deal with any paperwork or issues resulting from the last clinics.  Within 24 hours of my notice of resignation, two other board members had resigned and the remaining two board members tendered their resignations within weeks.  On the day I gave notice of my resignation, and after the Department of Finance had received my resignation, I was sent a letter from the Minister in response to my letter of 2 September 2021 requesting an update.  Unfortunately, this letter did not alter my decision to resign.<br\/><br\/>Since December 2021, I and two other members of DDMBA have participated in a subgroup to review the disabled drivers and passengers scheme set up by the Department of Finance.  My understanding from Department officials is that it is agreed that our review will come under the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, working group tasked with reviewing all Government-funded transport supports for those with disability.  I and other members of the DDMBA have repeatedly expressed our willingness to lend our experience and expertise to devising a new and fairer scheme.<br\/><br\/>I believe this statement demonstrates that the decision to resign from our positions on the DDMBA was a difficult one for board members and it did not happen without us making every effort to highlight the inadequacies of the scheme and to repeatedly advocate for comprehensive revision.  We have always tried to engage constructively with the Department and the Minister to try to push for change.  Unfortunately, on professional and ethical grounds, I felt my position as chairperson was untenable as I could no longer preside over a scheme that was inequitable and there seemed no urgency to even start the process of change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022051100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Cara McDonagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>I welcome both doctors.

I cannot say whether it was or not.  They always acknowledged our concerns but we were told there was not an appetite in the Department to change the scheme.  They acknowledged it was difficult for us at times.  During that phase we had a lot of very angry, aggrieved people.  That would not be infrequent but it was a particularly bad phase.

I wrote to them by email after that to document that we had discussed the concerns.  Nothing happened on foot of that.  Before my time as chair, I know predecessors had raised these concerns repeatedly.<\/p> <p>  The medical criteria are extremely difficult to apply.  One does not have to be a medical person to read those and wonder how they could be fairly applied.  Even taken as they are, there are many people they exclude who have genuine disability, need adapted vehicles and cannot understand why they cannot access anything.  If one has a scheme, it has to be more equitable.  Do not have a scheme that only applies to a small percentage of people.  <\/p> <p>  It is not just that the scheme tries to give benefits to those at the severe end of disability.

However, it is off to the side.  The witnesses are dealing with it and seeing the families who feel the system is failing them and venting at the witnesses.

A person missing an upper limb cannot drive a standard vehicle, for instance.  Somebody who is walking but has weakness on one side and therefore needs adaptations to the vehicle, such as hand controls, generally does not qualify.  Sometimes with children it is extremely difficult because they may be at the age where they should walk, developmentally, at two or three, but are not walking.  They may start to walk so it is difficult.  Parents are trying to prove their child will not walk.  No parent wants to try to convince a doctor that their child will not walk.  They spend most of their time doing the opposite.<\/p> <p>  The other difficult category is children with autism spectrum disorder and many behavioural problems.  All they really need may be a special seat for their car or a bigger vehicle.  They are not asking for all the scheme can provide but that is all there is.  There is just a scheme that provides a large financial benefit when maybe they would be happy with a grant towards a vehicle or a special seat.  It is difficult to bring a child into a room with three strange doctors and try, in front of the child, to talk of the difficulties they have in transportation.  That should not be the way.<\/p> <p>  Nowadays we look at disability in terms of function rather than in terms of pathology, whether autism, epilepsy or stroke.  We ask what the person can do and that is how we should assess people.

I work in Dublin 8 and we do not get many applications because even with the primary medical cert, these people cannot afford a car.  It is unacceptable that there are young people who cannot work for that reason.<\/p><p>We have a reversal of what should be happening.  Instead of people coming in and being asked what they can do they are being asked to prove how bad they are.

It is a shameful way to practise.  We are forcing a situation where in some cases people are desperately underplaying their levels of function in order to access transport.  With children we place ourselves at risk because we tell parents their child will not walk.  If that child does walk we are at risk because it is traumatic for parents.  They could come back to us and say they were traumatised.  The whole experience for the people who come in, whether they are adults or adults with a child, is traumatic.  It is doing harm.

I should mention I am a former member of the committee on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  This is an issue that was also discussed there.  There are a number of key decision points that are extraordinary to me, including the decision to appeal to the Supreme Court.  There is a Supreme Court ruling in this regard.  It seems the State, through the Minister for Finance and the board, had been fighting these individuals who were seeking their rights but the board had been expressing very serious concerns.  It is part of the culture in Ireland, unfortunately, that individuals have to seek their rights and the State pushes back at every stage.  Will the witnesses comment on how difficult the process was given that they agreed with many of the concerns?<\/p> <p>  I find extraordinary the amendment made in the Finance Act 2020.   The witnesses have mentioned there was no notification to the board on this legislation.  It is not simply a matter that the criteria identified as problematic were left hanging.  These criteria, which were narrow and not adequately delivering people's rights, were included again through new legislation.  There was almost a new decision by the Government to make these the criteria for access to the scheme.  Do the witnesses agree that such criteria, especially being introduced in 2020 after Ireland had ratified the UNCRPD, was an extraordinarily poor decision?  It was a new decision to embed them.

The Minister, in his defence, said it was an interim plan so that appeal hearings could proceed.  I felt it was the wrong approach.  When the Supreme Court decision was made on many levels I was relieved because I felt that now they would do something and they would change the scheme.  This was what I harped on at to the officials in the Department.  I thought that surely now we were going to do something.<\/p> <p>  Throughout that summer and even in the autumn I was regularly in contact with them, even at times when I was not working.  I was asking them when we were going to meet and start to look at this.  Nothing happened.  One of the officials told me the Minister was thinking of putting in the medical criteria, and that he had sought legal advice and it seemed to be an interim solution.  There was never confirmation of this.  I was sitting with my team in hospital when I found out.  The occupational therapists, who liaise with community doctors about referring patients for the primary medical certificate, said it would be up and running again in January.  I had no idea it was going to happen.<\/p> <p>  At that point we were all decided that we would not continue and that something had to be done.  The only power we really felt we had was to say we would not do it.  He appealed to us to reconsider on behalf of the people who would appeal and get the primary medical certificate.  At that point I said we needed to meet him because we needed to know that he understood where we are at and what needed to be done.  That was when the meeting happened.  He gave us many reassurances and seemed to understand the urgency of it.  We came away from that really feeling that something was going to happen but very little did happen.  There was some background work happening but it seemed to be at a very slow pace.  There was nothing yielding from it.  We were not getting updates or documents.  Any contact was through me making contact to ask whether there was any progress.  Ultimately I felt I could not do it any more.  It became harder and harder to sit in front of people.  We made decisions after seeing people but we had to write to people after listening to their stories.  We explained everything.  We explain about the criteria but it became increasingly difficult.

I refer to assistance with the sorts of legal issues mentioned.  Many legal issues arose on foot of the ruling by the Supreme Court and it was hard for me to access the legal advice.  The Department had sought it, but did not want to share it with me.  In fact, it became quite difficult and stressful to deal with that aspect.<\/p> <p>  It was a big factor for us.

Of course, people had the right to complain and we told them they had the right to complain to the Ombudsman if they were not happy with the decisions made.  All the letters received by applicants contain that information.  Most of the people getting this benefit when they appeal are people whose situations have progressed.

We would introduce ourselves and try to keep the process similar for each person.  We would always ask them if they understand what they are with us for and what they are applying for.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that nine out of ten people at the appeal stage cannot tell us what they are with us for.  They have been told it is a driving benefit they are entitled to.  Some people think it is the parking sticker - they may have come all the way from Kerry, for example, for something they could have got through their GP.  Occasionally, we encounter someone who is incredibly well informed, but the majority of people do not know about the primary medical certificate, its definition, the legalities or the criteria.  We send out the information to them in writing and we explain the situation to them.  Some of those people are a bit shocked because they thought they had come to us so they would be able to get a benefit to enable them to buy a car or get an adaptation.  They do not realise that this is done via tax.<\/p> <p>  We walk people through the process and they are shocked when they realise they are not with us to get a sticker.  Therefore, people are not really being informed of what they are applying for.  The mechanic or the social worker may have told them they are entitled to a benefit and they have applied for it.  This is a problem.  There is a large gap in what is being understood as being offered and what is actually being offered.  People are on the back foot from the beginning of the assessment.  They will often have come all the way from places like Cork, Kerry or Clare to try to fight for something and it will then have been exposed that they do not know what they have come for.  This whole process is about education.  It involves telling people what they are applying for, explaining the criteria and going through a detailed examination.  People are not told the outcome on the day, because the group of three must sit down and discuss applications to ensure there is consensus.  There are occasions where two members agree and one does not.  It is necessary to get through that.  Generally, however, it is found that there is full agreement with what happened at the first level.  <\/p> <p>  At that first, community, level, there is a great deal of pressure.  It is easier in the cities, but in the country and rural areas we get situations where the doctors are under pressure.  What they do is to advise the applicants to appeal.  Many of the applicants therefore come into us and say they went through the first level, but they were told they would get it on appeal.  That means they have an expectation.  As Dr. McDonagh said, the people who get this certificate on appeal are those who have a progressive condition like Parkinson's disease.  It may be six months later when they are seen by the DDMBA, their illnesses will have progressed and, sadly, those people will then qualify.  That is, however, a small percentage of the appellants.  The majority will be exactly as they were when they were seen at the first level.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of confusion as a result and all that builds into the atmosphere of anger and frustration.  People arrive sometimes accompanied by legal representation.  We ask their legal, or sometimes political, representative about the situation and they are unable to tell us what the primary medical certificate is.  Those individuals are there representing people, but they cannot tell us what they are representing them for.  Therefore, there is great lack of understanding about what is offered in this context and this plays into the lack of people being heard.  All people want is to be heard and to be helped, as appropriate, and not to be discriminated against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022051100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Nicky Scaramuzzi"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.

They are instead seeking something to help them and it does not have to be a benefit on the scale provided by this scheme.

Only last week I raised with the Department of Finance in a Commencement debate the replacement of the board and the filling of the positions.  I have constituents who have been waiting from mid-term last year for their appeals to be heard.  One constituent was in an accident and has plates in an arm, meaning their arms are not quite as flexible as those of the rest of us.  The person was turned down and is waiting for the appeal.  Should there be some sort of in-between board dealing with primary certificates for those who end up in a position like the one I have described?  The individual&rsquo;s movement is quite impeded.  An electronic car or a car that would not require much arm use would certainly be suitable, but I am not sure the individual will qualify after an appeal once the new board is put in place.  I understand that the possibility of an appeal is being assessed.<\/p> <p>  One of the delegates said there should be broader criteria.  Could they elaborate on their thinking in that regard?

One cannot just amend them and carry on as before.  The person the Senator described would probably be happy if he or she got a grant to adapt his or her vehicle.  That is what I was talking about earlier in terms of a graded scheme.  Some people need a very much adapted vehicle into which they can bring a wheelchair and fix it in.  There will never drive themselves so it is a matter of being transported.  People like that often work.  It might be surprising to people but I have patients who work despite quite significant disabilities.  They need a vehicle.  Most of them will qualify, but in the scheme there is only one benefit available.  Most people want a swivel seat or an automatic car that might be a little more expensive.  Alternatively, they might want a special seat or bigger car to separate the children because of behavioural problems.  There are all sorts of reasons.  The scheme should not be about ascertaining somebody&rsquo;s diagnosis and whether he or she is wholly or almost wholly without the use of his or her legs; it should be about determining what the person is able to do or not able to do.  For instance, the Irish Wheelchair Association's driving instructors assess people.  Where I work, they are assessed along with an occupational therapist in the car and they decide what the person needs.  It does not have to be a doctor doing this.  Maybe a doctor will have a role in some cases but the scheme needs to be more tailored to what we now understand about disability and how we manage it.  It should be about function rather than disability or dysfunction.  Most people come to us and do not even realise what the scheme offers.  They just say they want a swivel seat because it was really difficult for them to get in and out of the car.  You might need controls or whatever it might be.  Another request is for a bigger car or a special harness on a seat for an older child who needs to be properly seated in a car.<\/p> <p>  We have many ideas.

I have the pre-notes outlining the approach the Minister was going to take.  It is very clear that commitments were going to be given.  In the notes, it says that answers to some of the questions would be provided at the time of the finance Bill.  It appears that very little, if any, work had been done leading up to that.  One of the documents we have, dated 27 October 2021 - which would have been shortly after Dr. McDonagh's resignation letter - deals at the end with a number of issues such as how they were going to try to get the NRH to appoint a new chairperson, which obviously was not successful.  The last point, on managing communication, states that given the high profile of the disabled drivers scheme and of the review managing communications and messaging about the DDMBA resignations, it is extremely important and may be useful to discuss with the Minister's advisers the best approach in this regard.  We found out from RT&Eacute; on 11 January that there was no longer a board.  I find it astonishing that the House was not informed.  There was no public communication.  There was nothing in regard to this months after an entire board resigned.

He was suggesting that he was going to set up a working group, of which Dr. McDonagh is now part, to operate concurrently with the work that would be done by the NDIS working group on behalf of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  He made the point that it was important for the members of the DDMBA to see substantial progress being made towards a new scheme.  He said that if there was a delay in the secondary approach, the Department of Finance could implement the changes.  Is it Dr. McDonagh's understanding that this is still on the cards?  From our knowledge, the only meeting that took place in regard to the other working group with which she is concerned was on 26 January last, which coincided with the Minister being questioned here about the emerging information that the board of appeal had resigned.

We need to create a scheme that has levels where people with certain disabilities can access what is appropriate for them, in order to get them to participate in society.  It baffles me that the priority is scrabbling about to put a new board in place.  That should not be the priority.  To be honest, approximately 1% of those waiting for appeal might have progressed sufficiently to get it on appeal.  We are not actually harming a huge number of people, but people are being harmed by being continuously assessed at primary level and turned down due to a set of criteria that is not fit for purpose.  That is a problem.  I do not believe that the priority is in place to get this thing rewritten and present the Irish people with an equitable scheme for people with disability to access transport.  I think the priority has been to put together a new board to continue, in what could be a very questionable way, what is not working.  That is not good enough.  We need to prioritise sitting down.  We know what people with disability would like to help them with transport.  We are a huge resource.  We have both been involved in this for ten years.  We know what they want, and we want to help them.  We just need to sit down and get out of the mindset of rebuilding what is not working.

The Revenue Commissioners let us know.  I do not think anything like this should apply for an entire lifespan.  There is a need to review things, especially with children.  The premise is that people are going to be the same with their disability, but some people will get better, other people will get worse and technology will improve things.  The concept has changed since this scheme was put together.  As we say to people, being disabled in the 1950s was different from being disabled in the 1980s or 1990s.  The whole definition of disability has absolutely expanded to include many more people than was the case 50 years ago.  We need to build that into a scheme that grows, changes and looks at function.  The most important thing to get across today is that it should be about function, not diagnosis.  One person with multiple sclerosis can function perfectly well, whereas another person with multiple sclerosis might be in a wheelchair and need a hoist to be transferred.  The actual words of the diagnosis should not be relevant.  It should be about what a person can do; for example, what a person with a hoist transfer needs in order to be able to get to work as a coder in a software company.

One of my questions looks forward while the other looks back a little but also forward at the same time.  Obviously, this committee is responsible for finance and it deals with how matters are transposed into law in terms of the taxation end of it.  I am taken by the comments of our guests, but also those of the Ombudsman, regarding the scheme, the way it works and the fact that the provision of support is only available to people who already have money to expend.  Even if that was got right and it was still based on that type of criteria, that ignores so many families with disabilities.  The case that hit home with me was that of the parent of a child with autism.  The child was grabbing his parent from behind but, during the lockdown, it was the only comfort that could settle the child.  That was taken away from him because the scheme does not provide for the special seat that he needed.  That case involved a small amount of money that would transform the child and his siblings.  Anyone who is a parent of children with autism knows that it affects all the family.  I am digressing a little.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, we have to come up with our own solution, but is there an international model that has done this better than us or to which we should be looking?  I know that our guests indicated back in 2020 that they would not hear appeals but then reconsidered that.  Part of the letter that came from the Department or the Minister at that time was read out.  In my view, that letter was unfair as it nearly put the responsibility on our guests and suggested they were failing individuals, whereas it is the Department that has failed them over several years.  The board did reconsider at that point.  Would it reconsider again and get involved?  I refer to the expertise our guests have amassed over a long period.  Would they get involved under a new scheme?  Is there any possibility that they would work under the existing scheme again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022051100002#H00800","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":431,"content":"<p>I am not sure about working under the existing scheme again, to be honest.  It was a really difficult decision for us to reach.  We felt we had been back and forth with the Department and really tried to push.  For want of a better phrase, we stomped our feet and said we would not do it.  When the Department put the criteria into legislation we stated we would not do it, but then agreed to do it on the basis that the Department would do something about it.  Nothing happened, however, and it just got too much.  We believed the only way to make change was to pull back from it.  We did not do so without thinking of the people who then would not be able to attend for appeal.  We granted only a small percentage of overall applications but there is no other appeal mechanism.  Applicants can go through the assessment process after six months in the community but it would still be better if we were running appeal clinics.  Since we resigned, there have been meetings of the subgroup but, as the Deputy pointed out, there has only been one meeting of the national disability inclusion strategy working group tasked with this.  I believe that impetus is lacking.  If there was such an impetus, maybe we would reconsider.  I do not know.

The purpose of this change in language is differentiate licensed providers more clearly from unlicensed lenders.<\/p><p>The many suggestions relating to advertising are currently catered for either by the Consumer Credit Association, CCA, or the moneylending code.  In addition, the Central Bank has since published the moneylending regulations, which address areas like advertising and targeting.  The requirements of the moneylending regulations should assist customers and consumers in becoming more informed and encourage them to consider alternatives.  These requirements include that moneylenders insert an enhanced high-cost credit warning statement in all advertisements, regardless of whether advertising refers to a rate of interest or a cost of credit.  The following text must be included in the warning statement: \"Warning: This is high-cost credit. Consider alternative options before applying for this credit, including alternatives from other lenders regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\"  The cost of credit must be clearly displayed on the moneylender's website, and they are required to provide an information notice on the application stage.  Moneylenders' advertising must be clear, not misleading, and presented in a way that customers will know that it is an advertisement.  Moneylenders can no longer make unsolicited contact on the recommendations of an existing customer, in other words, refer a friend.  This is a very important issue that deals with vulnerable people who might be looking for funding in the run-up to some of the big family events.<\/p><p> Moneylenders are required to take reasonable steps to identify customers who are vulnerable customers and to ensure they are provided with the assistance that may be necessary.  The essence of this legislation, which was not there before and which is very strong now, is that, before the moneylender gives a loan, they must look at the person's ability to repay that loan and take into account the existing financial commitments the person might have.  There is a requirement for moneylenders to consider that.  The whole tone of this legislation is that when the Central Bank is satisfied that some high-cost lenders are not actually doing that, it can have an impact on their licence.  They could have it withdrawn, suspended or, ultimately, not renewed.  This is the whole tone of the Bill.  It is not just one section the deals with this.<\/p><p> Since we have spoken, the Central Bank has published its moneylending regulations to address the issue of advertising.

It is that type of advertisement.  We are aware advertising takes place in different ways now than it did in the past.  That kind of leaflet drop is still a part of moneylenders' operational procedures.  They are not going to drop leaflets out in Donnybrook.  They target social housing estates and they target areas they believe are lower income areas.  They make it very appealing to people that there is an easy fix.  Given the Government is legislating for warnings around the high costs of the interest rates, does the Minister of State not feel this is a missed opportunity to prohibit that type of practice?  We know of this type of lending.  I am sure everyone in this House would advise people that before they go to a moneylender, they should check all of their other options, including credit unions and loan supports by the State through the credit union movement, and other retail banks.  Allowing them to advertise at times of vulnerability is a mistake.  I believe it is something we will have to come back and revisit in this legislation in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#B00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I understand.  We were all in the same space on this in protecting vulnerable customers at a vulnerable period in the year just coming up to Christmas.<\/p> <p>  The Central Bank brought in the high-cost warning requirements, which came into effect on 1 September 2020, and the remainder of those regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021.  Some of those have already come into effect since the discussion started around this legislation.  It is very important that the \"refer a friend\" practice will be dealt with now under this legislation.  When somebody gets a loan, many may say to a neighbour \"This is where I got the loan\".  There are no statistics on that but it is a common way for people to hear about a particular moneylender or high-cost credit company.  Provision to deal with this \"refer a friend\" practice is included in the legislation.<\/p> <p>  Banning advertising for certain periods of the year is probably a broader societal issue rather than being specific to this issue.  That is something we did not do in the pre-legislative scrutiny with regard to the advertising industry.  That would be a very broad debate that can happen in the Oireachtas, with much wider implications than this exact legislation.  The credit unions have a good product out there.  Some 102 credit unions have an offer called It Makes Sense, which are loans to help customers with household budgetary items.  In many of these communities the credit unions are having an impact.<\/p> <p>  I would expect a reduction in the leaflet drops because, up to now, a key feature of moneylending has been the door-to-door collection.  It is a key feature.  People were calling to the housing estates, which Deputy Doherty referred to, monthly or weekly collecting money.  Part of that may have been the delivery of leaflets.  Under this legislation, the cost of a door-to-door collection is not facilitated.  The moneylenders cannot charge for a door-to-door collection fee.  We cannot stop them calling door to door to collect money, but they cannot charge for it or include it in the interest rate or a fee associated with the loan.  I would genuinely expect there to be a significant reduction in the number of people calling to houses in housing estates collecting money and possibly delivering leaflets when they are doing the same exercise.  It will be a by-product of this legislation.  They will not be calling around to those housing estates regularly.  There is, however, no proposal to abolish door-to-door leaflet drops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#B00500","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":454,"content":"<p>That is a mistake in the context of how they operate and how they target vulnerable customers.

We challenge the interest that is being charged to someone who takes out a six-month loan from a moneylender, and we can see that they are paying possibly ten to 12 times more than if they had received the same amount of money from a credit union.  They must pay hundreds of additional euro than if they had got that loan from a credit union.  It sounds terrible that they will have paid &euro;300 or &euro;400 more, for example, but the reality for many individuals who have gone to a moneylender is the practice of continuing to keep them under the grip of the moneylender.  The moneylender advertises a loan as the current loan is expiring, which means the person is in a continuous period of high-cost credit.

Under this legislation, the loan must be repaid and it must be only a 12-month loan.  A new loan would be required to be taken for a second period.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has said that towards the end of a loan term, a customer would be offered a new loan.  The second item in the legislation that did not exist heretofore is the obligation to carry out a review of the ability to pay the loan within the 12 months before issuing that loan again.  In the past moneylenders were piling loans on people and maybe two or three moneylenders were calling to some houses.  Now there will be a requirement to know the total ability of the person taking the loan to repay it through normal credit checks.  They did not have to do those up to now.  There are approximately 40 companies in the country that will rely on the Central Bank of Ireland for approval for the period of their licence and if it finds they are not complying with the obligation and are giving loans to people where it is reasonable to say they are not able to repay the loans, it will affect the Central Bank's view.

I welcome it.  That misses the real point, however, as the default rate with moneylenders is very small anyway.  People pay these loans and the issue is not the ability to pay.  It is the fact that moneylenders are fleecing these people.  If a person borrows &euro;1,000 and pays approximately &euro;560 in interest, rolling it over by taking out a new loan each year, in four years that person will pay over &euro;2,000 in interest on the original &euro;1,000 loan.  That is the problem.  It is not ability to pay because evidence indicates the people will pay the loan.  The issue is the loan will have cost the family thousands of euro in interest over four years.  That is the problem.  The practice will be allowed to continue where Mary and Joe come to the end of their term and the moneylender might say that Seamus is going to college next year and offer a loan for that.  The lender will offer to work out the paperwork in taking out the new loan.  The &euro;1,000 that people will have \"repaid\" is still be paid and the lender will take another &euro;560 in interest.<\/p> <p>  That is the issue and it is immoral that a type of loan such as this is rolled over continuously, and this happens with many families.

They were given loans that, effectively, they could not repay.  There is almost an assumption the loan will roll over repeatedly.  That will be stopped with this legislation.

The Central Bank must be satisfied and it has the ability to monitor these companies, which will now be regulated.  There are only a couple of dozen of them in the country.  I am satisfied the Central Bank will monitor the provisions in this new legislation very closely.

Since this Bill was published, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit and Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2022 has added another reference to the word &quot;moneylending&quot; in the Statute Book.

They will allow the Central Bank to take account of the conduct of the high-cost credit providers in the same way that the bank treats other regulated financial service providers, for example in the monetary compliance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulations or codes of conduct.  This deals with the discussion we have been having here up to now.  I am talking about situations where providers breach financial services legislation by failing to pay the Central Bank levies on time or where they do not submit key information on the central credit register on time, or at all.  With the terms of the licences moving now from one to five years, these changes will bring the high-cost credit providers&rsquo; licences more in line with those of other financial service providers.<\/p><p>I have read the general note I have been provided on these amendments, which were grouped together for discussion.  I can go into more detail, if required, on the specifics.  As I say, amendment No. 4 is the substantive one.  The other three amendments are only there to ensure amendment No. 4 is properly inserted into the legislation.  <\/p><p>I will move on to amendment No. 4, which is the substantive one.  Section 93(10) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 sets down the list of practices which the Central Bank can take into account when deciding whether to grant a high-cost credit provider's licence.  The items added to this list will mean that the provider must satisfy the bank that it will be able to comply with the requirements of being a licensed high-cost credit provider, and a regulated financial service provider more generally, and that it will conduct its business in such a way as to ensure the protection of its customers - which is new - and in compliance with any other requirements considered necessary by the bank for the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of high-cost credit and the protection of the applicant&rsquo;s customers.  This legislation is, therefore, very strong on customer protection, which the Central Bank will have a role in now when the providers proceed to the renewal of a particular licence.<\/p><p>Finally, section 93 deals with the factors considered when suspending or revoking a licence.  The Central Bank will now be able to take into account whether the high-cost credit provider has failed or is failing to comply with any condition or requirement under the financial services regulation.  The Central Bank will now clearly have authority to be able to amend or revoke a licence during the course of the five-year period.  The other two amendments are minor, relatively speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D01900","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":496,"content":"<p>I must mention that acceptance of this amendment involves deletion of section 4 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":497,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Section 4 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":499,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":500,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tIn page 7, to delete line 27.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":501,"content":"<p>Are we dealing with amendment No. 5?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":502,"content":"<p>No, we are on section 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02550","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":503,"content":"<p>We have deleted section 4 and we have moved on to section 5.

It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, to be known as the initial cap; a simple interest of no more than 0.035% per week up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years, which would be known as the further reduced cap.<\/p><p>The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to the interest charged on a &euro;1,000 cash loan by a credit union and by the largest money lender operating in the State is significant.  Currently, on a &euro;1,000 loan over a 12-month period, a credit union charges interest of &euro;60 while a money lender, for the same loan over the same period, would charge &euro;560 in interest.  The initial cap that I am proposing for a three year period would reduce that &euro;560 down to &euro;360 but would substantially reduce it further after the three year period down to &euro;180.  The initial cap would be six times that which the credit union would apply but, as we get to the second step, it would be three times what the credit union would charge.  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which obviously have pushed up the cost of credit further in the past.<\/p><p>I argued strongly on this when my own legislation was before the House but unfortunately, the Minister voted against all sections of that Bill.  We have tweaks in some of the sections of this Bill to the licences of moneylenders, which I broadly support, but when we get down to the meat and bones of this legislation, what the Government is legislating for is to allow high-cost credit but with a warning on the label.  It is like phoning people up to tell them that they are going to get robbed in the next half an hour.  The Government is just letting them know that they are going to get robbed but what I want to do is stop the burglar coming through the door in the first place.  This amendment would still allow for substantial profits to be made on these types of loans, which have been described by others during the pre-legislative scrutiny process as immoral.  It would still allow for high interest rates to be charged, specifically in the initial period but I would argue that a step-down approach is the more appropriate way to deal with this and to bring it into line, with reference to credit union lending.  The initial cap of six times the credit union rate and then three times the rate in the further cap is appropriate.  I commend the amendment to the select committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#E00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his proposed amendment.  I know that Deputy Doherty has a great interest in this legislation and I can see where he is coming from with his proposal.   Lower interest rates are better for consumers.  The key purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates.  Deputy Doherty will say that Government is not being ambitious enough, but we have to strike a balance and reduce rates without reducing access to credit.  We can reduce rates right down but we might not have any companies providing credit if it is not viable from their point of view.  We want to make sure that the people we are talking about have access to credit.  If we make it unviable for providers, then people will not have access to credit except through the illegal moneylenders that we all want them to avoid.  There is a balance to be struck between reducing the rate and making sure that we keep lenders in the market.  We are looking at a substantial reduction from where we were previously.  We need to do this in a balanced, responsible way.<\/p> <p>  There is currently a concentration of loan offerings between 1% and 1.2% per week in the market.  Most of the loans tend to be in that bracket.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% per week will allow moneylenders operating at rates above the limit to revise their business model and reduce their margins to enable them to operate within the legislative cap.  This is not the ultimate destination but it is the right place to start.  The legislation also sets down the principles and policies to guide the Minister when making regulations to set the specific caps going forward.  This provides flexibility to amend the caps downwards while ensuring that there is always an upper limit in the primary legislation.  We are starting with 1% but the legislation specifically allows for that cap to be reduced.  It cannot go above 1%, but it can be reduced.  What we are saying is that at the point of introducing this legislation, we want the rate to be 1% but we are not precluding, after a couple of years when the Central Bank has monitored its operation closely, reducing that further.  That is provided for in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty's proposal is to have the reduced rate now, but I would be fearful that if we go too low too quickly this will lead to fewer people offering credit.  Furthermore, to fix the reduction in primary legislation without any assessment by the Central Bank of how the legislation is operating would not be good practice.  We are starting with 1% per week, with the commitment that it can be reviewed when we get some information from the Central Bank as to how this is operating.  It may be appropriate to reduce the rate at that stage.  This is a maximum cap and represents a reasonable and balanced approach.  I understand where Deputy Doherty is coming from, but we are clear about the way we want to do this.  It is a very big step from where we are to go down to 1%, with the option of going further at a later date, on foot of information from the Central Bank, without the need to revisit the primary legislation<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#E00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>We went through this before but I ask the Minister of State to clarify his proposal.

None of us like to see the high rates that have been in place, but we are on a road whereby we can reduce the rates at a further date.

The Minister of State is saying that instead of them charging &euro;560 interest on a &euro;1,000 loan, we are going to legislate for them to charge &euro;480.  Jesus Christ, this Minister has got your backs, folks.  Interest of &euro;480 if people take out a &euro;1,000 loan is ridiculous.  I tabled this legislation years ago.  I have been frustrated at every stage.  The Government has made a dog's dinner of my legislation.  Every single amendment was deleted, bar the definitions.  The Government has frustrated this and come forward with the argument that it would bring a Bill itself which would be better.  It is absolutely terrible that the Government is going to allow moneylenders to charge this level of interest on people in society who are on very low incomes.  Those people are really pressed now because of all the issues in terms of inflation.  Where is the calculation?

The majority of loans are above this figure, and we are bringing it down.  That is only part of this debate.  Deputy Doherty has studiously not dealt with the other issue.  The existing legislation allows for the cost of door to door collection to be charged as well.  That is being abolished in this legislation.  What I am saying to people in this situation is that up to now they were paying a very high interest rate and they were also being charged a fee for door-to-door collection, which in many cases was even in excess of the cost of interest.  We are eliminating that cost entirely.  Moneylenders cannot charge for door-to-door collection.  That is a very significant element of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  The interest rate is a further enhancement for customers.  As I stated previously, this legislation sets the cap at 48% - 1% per week.  That is the maximum in the legislation and there is clear provision for that to be reduced at a further date if the circumstances warrant when we see the operation of this Act and the report from the Central Bank on how it is being implemented.  The legislation provides specifically for reduction at a later date.  I understand that the Deputy is in opposition to the legislation as proposed, but the essential difference between us is that we are saying we are abolishing the charges for door-to-door collection, which is a very significant issue, and we are introducing a cap which will immediately reduce interest rates for the majority of people who have loans from high-cost lenders.  In addition, we are providing for a further reduction in the interest rate to be made in due course, depending on how the legislation operates.

The core point that he made is that this would scare people off.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party believe that if lenders cannot charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 loan, then there is no market for them in Ireland, so we need to allow these companies to be able to charge that level of interest.

We want to make sure that we have that option available.  We could bring it down to 20% and have nobody in this market, but that would be a worst-case scenario.<\/p> <p>  In May 2019, the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process to gather views from stakeholders on whether the Government should introduce a statutory interest rate cap on moneylenders in Ireland, along with other regulatory matters.  The majority of submissions received were in favour of the introduction of an interest rate cap.  These submissions were primarily received from non-governmental organisations and credit unions.  All of the comments and submissions made through this consultation process have been considered and taken into account, as appropriate, in formulating the proposed policy options.<\/p> <p>  What we did say is we are striking a balance to make sure, first, that we are eliminating the charge for door to door collection, which is a significant feature; second, we are reducing the rate that is being charged on the majority of loans; third, it is a maximum cap that can be reduced at a further date.  We have taken all those factors into account to make sure we have people who will lend money at this rate.  There are only a couple of dozen companies operating in the country.  This is a balanced approach to achieve those three objectives.  It is not only looking at one side of the equation.

It is my understanding that sections 2 and 3 relate to the deduction by insurers of Covid-19 related State supports for final business interruption insurance claim settlements.  We are all quite aware of how difficult Covid-19 has been for businesses and the impact it has had.  The fact that people had to use that business interruption insurance shows the impact it had.  The Central Bank informed my party in written correspondence in May last year that more than &euro;163 million had been paid out to in excess of 5,000 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  Over the course of the pandemic, it became apparent that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of the business interruption payouts.  That came as a major concern to businesses.  The reality is many of the insurance companies thrived during the pandemic.<\/p><p>These payments were made to assist the businesses, not big insurance companies.  I am seeking an update on this because this section deals with it.  I also have a question on sections 3 and 4 relating to the database, but perhaps the Minister of State can give an update on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#J01000","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":579,"content":"<p>This is an important new section in the legislation regarding deducting the value of State supports.  That issue became apparent as the Covid-19 situation emerged.  There is a general misunderstanding among the public because many of the insurance companies had said they would not deduct any payments the State had made from any payments they would be making under business interruption policies.  Many people felt that all that funding was going to come back to the State.  However, what the companies that made those statements did not say is that the vast majority of them had no business interruption policies to start with.  When they knew they had no business interruption policies, it was very easy to make a statement that they would not deduct any State payments from any payments they might be making because they were making no payments anyway.  That point has not been picked up fairly across the industry.  I am putting it on the record now because a narrative about this issue has carried through in that respect.  With regard to the figure the Deputy mentioned, most of that relates to one particular company.  Most of the other companies that have spoken on this in various public venues said they would not be deducting from any of this because they were not providing business interruption policies to start with.  I want to make that clear.  They were correct in what they said, but people did not fully grasp the subtlety of what they were saying.<\/p> <p>  When this issue arose and it came to our attention during the course of the pandemic that the limited number of insurance companies that had business interruption policies were deducting some of the State payments so that the business or sometimes sole traders, if they were publicans or restaurateurs, would receive the net loss, there was concern in the Department and the Government that the insurance companies might make a profit from the State supports.  We immediately examined this matter closely with a view to dealing with it, but it became clear from legal advice that it was not possible to legislate retrospectively.  Bear in mind that these policies might have been written before the Covid-19 pandemic and these payments happened during it.  When we saw this happening, it was not possible to come back and change a policy that was written 18 months or two years previously because it was a legal document.  It was not possible to look back retrospectively to claim payments in respect of policies that were issued and in existence before that.<\/p> <p>  The issue that arises then, and I would put this down as one of the big lessons from Covid, is that we saw what happened.  The reason we are introducing these sections is so we can gather information on these supports, and if any other situation arises in the future, we will have a base to work from and to understand how it works.  It might not be related to Covid.  Some other issue could arise in the country where there is an insurance policy and the State is also supplementing some of the cost.  This is a forward-looking legislative measure and it is important that it be seen in that context.<\/p> <p>  I will make another point.  The reason I looked at this at that stage was that I was conscious that, under the Department of Social Protection, other State payments may be relevant to insurance claims.  There already are processes in place.  We already had legislation in place dating back many years strictly to deal with what is known as the recovery of benefits and assistance scheme by the Department of Social Protection.  I will explain it simply.  Let us say somebody was in a car accident and he or she was out of work for a significant period and received disability payments for a period.  Then the insurance company settles the claim in due course.  It estimates the value of the person's claim at &euro;100,000, for example, but the person has already received &euro;20,000 from the State.  If the company pays out the &euro;100,000 there is a legal mechanism in place for the insurance company to refund that &euro;20,000 back to the State.  That happens currently.  Ultimately, we want to get to that situation across the board, but the first thing we must do is gather information on this.<\/p> <p>  On the up-to-date figure I have in respect of business interruption policies, the Central Bank has stated that a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling claims as a result of the Central Bank's intervention.  I welcome recent data to the end of February 2022 which show that more than &euro;171 million has been paid to 5,312 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This is up from the earlier figure.<\/p> <p>  Another point is that this matter is still before the courts, so the matter may yet come to light as part of the quantum hearing in ongoing litigation that remains before the courts.  The approach of the Bill is designed to ensure we do not pre-empt any legal ruling by passing legislation at this stage before the relevant court cases are dealt with.  This issue may be raised during those quantum hearings which are not yet concluded.  From that point of view, I am precluded from saying anything further on this because, as people will appreciate, the matter is currently before the courts.<\/p> <p>  However, this is really a lesson learned for the future.  We want to have a cross-government approach.  We already have it in the Department of Social Protection and, ultimately, I would like to see this in any Department where a similar situation could arise in the future.  The first thing that must be done is gather the information so the Central Bank will be able to give us information.  When we get that information we can then look at policy implications and draw up legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":580,"content":"<p>Although my next question is about the information, it relates to sections 3 and 4, so I will wait until we get to section 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":581,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":582,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 3 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":584,"content":"<p>Sections 3 and 4 require, as part of the national claims information database, data on any deductions from insurance claims settlements by insurance companies that relate to public moneys.

Sections 5 and 6 relate to the issue of dual pricing.  Unfortunately, this practice is where companies are identifying loyal but often vulnerable customers who might not have the ability to look around insurance companies and are less likely to shop around, but are also more than likely more sensitive to price changes and so forth.  It is often recognised that price gouging undermines the interests of loyal customers, and this has long been talked about in the House.<\/p><p>Indeed, it is something a lot of customers talk about a lot as well.  It is welcome that the Central Bank is taking action in regard to banning price discrimination.  This is clearly something Deputy Pearse Doherty has been campaigning on for a long number of years and, in fact, he submitted a complaint as far back as October 2019.<\/p><p> What is important is that when regulations come into force, they are kept under constant review.  We know that the Central Bank had previously found that 2.5 million customers were paying a combined &euro;187 million more than the actual cost of their policies, which is very significant.  Can the Minister of State advise in regard to keeping these regulations under constant review, if that will be happening and how he sees that going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K01700","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":596,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her constructive comments.  I acknowledge the role of her party colleague, Deputy Doherty, in dealing with this topic over a period of time.<\/p> <p>  We had complicated issues with price walking and dual pricing, and they were connected issues but subtly different in their own way.  What is happening here is that we are dealing with this issue as part of the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance across all Departments.  To put the insurance plan in context, the relevant committee is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, so the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is involved, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I am also involved from the Department of Finance because insurance is a regulated industry.  The committee also involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and, in particular, the Minister for Justice because much of the legislation comes from the Department of Justice with regard to insurance.  It is a whole-of-government approach.<\/p> <p>  In dealing with the action plan for insurance, all the bodies I have mentioned have different roles on different aspects, different legislation comes from the Department of Justice, and State agencies like the Central Bank have a key role in implementing some of the measures.  The Department of Finance has put forward this Bill and we also helped bring forward legislation on the personal injuries guidelines six months earlier than had originally been envisaged.  Right across that committee, different sections of the State are doing different operations.<\/p> <p>  In this section, what we have is an acknowledgement that the Central Bank has agreed to implement this from 1 July for dual pricing only.  That is in regard to motor policies, whereby people should get a price equivalent to that of a new customer.  We have had what we call the loyalty penalty, whereby people who are with an insurance company and never seek to move to another company may well have been paying too much for not doing that.  After nine years, they would be paying a penalty of about 12% or 14%.  The issue in the house insurance market is even more serious and, after nine years, some people are paying up to 34% over and above what they would be paying if they were a new customer going into the same insurance company to insure the same house for the same value.<\/p> <p>  That is extraordinary but understandable.  Just around Leinster House, I have asked people which company their house insurance is with and they reply that they got their house insurance when they took out their mortgage, and they are not exactly sure.  Very few people query their house insurance because it just goes through as part of the mortgage payment.  For that reason, I think insurance companies have abused the situation and loyal customers, and they were adding a small percentage, year by year, knowing people would never check it.  I encourage people to find out which company their house insurance is with in the first place, and to make sure they make the phone call at the next renewal date.<\/p> <p>  From 1 July, this practice is going to be outlawed by the Central Bank.  The amendment in this section arises because the Department of Finance has insisted that the Central Bank will not just do it, because it will do it, but that it will produce a report within a set timeframe of one year after the coming into being of the Act, or as quickly as possible thereafter.  I am sure that report will be published by the Central Bank directly as well.  We have asked for some interim information after a six-month period to see the effect of this change.  There is no point in something happening if we do not have the evidence to track it.  Our role here is to make sure there is a reporting mechanism back into the system.  This practice has been ongoing for ages and it is now coming to an end.  We want the evidence and the proof that it is coming to an end.  That is why we have this section to make sure there is a clear report from the Central Bank in regard to those areas.<\/p> <p>  We are the first country in the EU to introduce this price walking ban.  Other countries in the EU have been talking about it and England has commenced a similar but slightly different approach, but we are the first country in the EU to introduce this.  This is to ensure the Central Bank comes back to us next year with the hard information and then, like everything else, when we get the information, we will be in a position to take whatever policy decisions are required.  I expect that, given the fact the Central Bank is outlawing the practice straightaway from 1 July, we will see reductions in those cases for loyal, long-standing customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#L00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":597,"content":"<p>It is shocking that insurers have been doing that.

In order to protect consumers&rsquo; interests, section 11 amends the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015.<\/p><p> These amendments will provide for technical changes in order to address two issues identified by the Central Bank of Ireland and relating to the scope of an insurance temporary run-off regime for UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers.  This arises directly as a result of Brexit.  The temporary run-off regime was established to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers from the Irish market following the departure of the UK from the EU in order to protect almost 35,000 policyholders.  Those companies provided insurance policies to 35,000 policyholders but are now withdrawing from the market because of Brexit.  The aim was to enable such firms to continue to service their existing portfolio of business for up to 15 years in order to ensure service continuity of those insurance contracts for existing Irish policyholders.  Other EU member states also introduced similar provisions.<\/p><p> Section 11 provides for the following changes to the scope of the temporary run-off scheme.  First, it amends the 2015 regulation to provide that UK and Gibraltar firms in the temporary run-off regime that are in the process of running off their existing insurance liabilities in the State may provide third-party reinsurance business here.  This change will align the temporary run-off regime with the provisions of the 2015 regulations whereby third-country undertakings can carry on reinsurance activities in the State, provided that they satisfy certain conditions.  This should also assist to preserve reinsurance capacity in the Irish market.   This is to facilitate the wind-down in an orderly manner.<\/p><p> Section 11 further amends the 2015 regulations to enable firms in liquidation that otherwise satisfy the conditions of the temporary run-off regime but may have had their authorisation withdrawn under the law in the UK or Gibraltar prior to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU to enter into the regime and run-off their Irish insurance portfolio in order to terminate their activity in the State.  This is a separate provision to deal with insurance companies that have gone into liquidation and will not be continuing in the long term.  This is necessary as the current wording of the 2015 regulations makes it a condition of entry to the temporary run-off scheme that the entity was, immediately before the relevant date, authorised as an insurance undertaking under the law in the UK or Gibraltar.  However, some firms in liquidation may have had their authorisation withdrawn before 2021 on the opening of the winding-up of the proceedings and, therefore, would not otherwise be able to enter the temporary run-off scheme.  It is important to note that these changes to the 2015 regulations merely reflect what was the original policy intent behind the temporary run-off scheme.  The amendments will not give UK- or Gibraltar-based insurance firms any competitive advantage over firms based in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU or EEA.  As it is an issue relating to dates, we were concerned that these firms would be captured.  It may be the case that some companies that were in liquidation and had their authorisation withdrawn before 1 January may not otherwise be able to fully avail of this temporary run-off scheme.  There is no change in policy; it is just a clarification of an issue relating to dates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#L02000","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":616,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am also joined by Ms Ita O'Sullivan and Mr. John O'Donoghue, members of the HSE's legal team for this project.<\/p> <p>  While there is good, proper and important debate about this issue, I believe we all agree on many of the important issues relating to this project.  First, clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, provide excellent care to women and infants and have been leaders in modernising women&rsquo;s healthcare.  Second, a new and modern hospital building is urgently needed for the National Maternity Hospital and services for women need to be expanded there.  Third, the new hospital should be built beside a major adult hospital to ensure women will have access to the widest possible range of healthcare.  Fourth, the new hospital must be fully clinically independent and there must be no religious influence, now or in the future.  Fifth, the new hospital must provide all services and all procedures that are permissible under law.  Finally, the State&rsquo;s investment must be protected.<\/p> <p>  The proposal we are discussing meets all of these goals.  This is a partnership between the State, the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The National Maternity Hospital will provide all the clinicians, who will move from Holles Street to the new building, and the National Maternity Hospital will run the new hospital.  The State will fund the construction of the new hospital building and retain full ownership of the building as an asset, while St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group will provide lease ownership to the State for 300 years.  Each party will appoint three directors to the new board of the NMH, and the NMH will, in turn, appoint directors to the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The two hospitals will be physically connected to ensure seamless access to care for patients, which is especially important for critically ill patients.  Both hospitals will provide shared services to be used throughout the healthcare campus.  Many clinicians will work in both hospitals, as they do now.<\/p> <p>  A structure was agreed in the 2016, namely, the Mulvey agreement, whereby the shares in the NMH charitable company will be owned by the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group charitable company.  This provides St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group with some administrative rights relating to, for example, accepting annual accounts at general meetings and approving the appointment of auditors.  The national maternity hospital will be fully clinically, operationally and financially independent.  It will have its own constitution and its own operating licence with the HSE.  All procedures that are currently carried out at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street will be provided at the new national maternity hospital.  The new hospital will provide all maternity, gynaecology, obstetric and neonatal services that are legally permissible.  These include, but are not limited to, terminations, tubal ligations and gender-reaffirming procedures.  Religious involvement in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has ended with the transfer of shares.  Religious involvement in the National Maternity Hospital will also end.  For example, the chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital since its foundation has been the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Religious influence of any kind is expressly prohibited in the new national maternity hospital.  There is no mechanism for any religious involvement, now or at any time in the future, in either St. Vincent's Healthcare Group or the new national maternity hospital.<\/p> <p>  Ireland does not have a good track record when it comes to religion and women&rsquo;s reproductive health.<\/p><p>It has a poor and dark history.  Women are, therefore, rightly demanding that when it comes to our new national maternity hospital there can be no religious involvement whatsoever at any point, now or into the future.  Women and, indeed, men are right to demand that.  People for very understandable reasons are demanding absolute assurances that all legally permissible services are provided, and they are right to make that demand.  All of these services are provided in Holles Street today.  The same clinicians, some of whom are here today, are going to provide these new services in the new hospital.<\/p><p> Concerns are understandably being raised and questions are being asked about land ownership and other issues.  I look forward to discussing these issues with the committee.  I also look forward to hearing from the people who provide the services in Holles Street.  Those of us who campaigned for repeal of the eighth amendment said we must listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity hospitals.  That is what I asked people to do in Wicklow when I walked up and down the streets and knocked on doors week after week.  Some of those same clinicians are with us today.  I hope that on this important issue, we will once again listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity services and providing these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#C00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":632,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I believe this ultimately comes down to a deep-seated mistrust of institutional Ireland based on an appalling track record in our country when it comes to the church and women's reproductive health.  Ultimately, I think that is what this boils down to, and I understand that.  It has, therefore, been incumbent upon four Ministers for Health - my predecessors, Dr. James Reilly, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and me - and two Governments to make sure those concerns are addressed absolutely and the new hospital we set up not only provides all of the guarantees and services that are needed, but gives space to expand the provision of those services and many other women's healthcare services, including maternity, obstetrics, fertility and gynaecology.  I ask for a response to the Deputy's question, because it goes to the heart of everything we are doing here, from some of the clinicians who are working and providing the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":635,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for giving us an opportunity to come and tell our stories and to outline why this hospital is so important.  I agree with the Minister.  Ireland has been through a lot.  When we look back at the history of women's health in particular and the interplay between church and State, it has been very difficult for women.  It has had a profound impact on women's health and lives.  We are now moving forward into a different Ireland.  We have seen huge advances in the past ten years.  The campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment was a real moment for me.  I remember attending a meeting of a health committee, just like this one, in 2013 when I was pretty much a lone voice.  I was not as lonely as all the women who had gone to Europe to fight their cases on their own.  By 2018, we had all come together and we had a movement and could talk about and express what happened to women.  That was a pivotal point in our history in terms of moving forward in women's health.<\/p> <p>  With this project, we are moving forward again.  We are saying goodbye to the church completely.  There is no religious ethos pertaining in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is a complete separation.  We are moving forward and leaving that behind.  However, we are moving forward in a different way.  The vision for this hospital is a vision of enormous possibility for what we can give to women in this country.  It is not just about the old facilities in Holles Street where women are crowded into tiny wards and long 14-bed wards, where we do not have an intensive care unit, ICU, or high-dependency unit, HDU, where babies are crammed into units in which their parents cannot be with them and where there are no toilets and a lack of showers.  We have heard a great deal about this.  The new facility is going to be magnificent.  We will have a facility where the tiniest citizens in the State, babies as small as 23 weeks and weighing 500 g, will be in a magnificent, dedicated pre-term birth centre and their parents can stay with them and be involved in their care.  A neonatal intensive care unit is a really scary place.  We know this has much better outcomes for babies.  We will have proper labour rooms.  We will give expression to the maternity strategy in terms of having all that choice for women, with midwifery-led birthing units, birthing pools and beautiful rooms.  Women will have dignified, single-room accommodation across the whole building.  We will have proper operating theatres.  The key here is that those operating theatres will link into St. Vincent's hospital, the very place we need them to link into, and also into the hospitals ICU and HDU, which Holles Street does not have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  It is much more than that, however.  I think the piece we have missed is what is on the campus of St. Vincent's hospital.  Women have been hearing a lot and have been worried that the services available to them will be restricted.  It is quite the opposite.  We will be hugely increasing services.  The St. Vincent's hospital campus deals with 150,000 inpatient and day-patient cases every year.  There are 50 clinical specialties, more than 200 consultants and 5,000 staff delivering a whole gamut of healthcare services which will be available for women.  The hospital already cares for 500 women with breast cancer every year who are treated there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Mahony have any worries about any possible religious influence on the procedures that may or may not take place in the hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>I absolutely do not, for two main reasons.

In the course of our conversation, I would like an opportunity to go through in detail all of those layers that give us those protections.<\/p> <p>  In parallel, St. Vincent's hospital is now a secular organisation.  There is no link to the church.  That is over and gone.  When the share transfer was completed, it marked the end of any association with the Religious Sisters of Charity and any association with religion.  We are now a secular organisation and the constitutions of St. Vincent's Holdings, the holding company that holds the shares, and the operating company, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, are published in full on the website.

The conditions are that we, the State, remain as the tenant running healthcare services there.  By agreement, that can be changed but essentially once we are running our hospital on the site, that is that.  There is a condition that we do not look to acquire freehold ownership of the site.

Those conditions relate to the State continuing to provide public healthcare facilities from that building into the future and for the term of 299 years.  That protects both parties.  It protects St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which owns the freehold interest in the site, to ensure that the State does not try to change the use of the facility to something else.  This facility will be state-of-the-art but in less than 299 years, it will need to be redeveloped, replaced and refurbished.

It does not want to give the State the land because it does not want a HSE hospital on that site.  As a result of that, we have ended up with a convoluted process, as I have discussed with the Minister in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, of companies within companies.

That is a fundamental problem.<\/p> <p>  I will make a point to the clinicians in the room.  I have no difficulty with clinicians arguing we need a new hospital.  We fully agree.  There is nobody in this room who does not want a new national maternity hospital.  I do not dispute that Holles Street is not fit for purpose.  The Rotunda Hospital is not fit for purpose.  Of course we need a new national maternity hospital but we have wider responsibilities.  We have to protect patients, clinicians and the interests of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer and the interests of patients and citizens are best protected by a public hospital on public land, rather than the convoluted process the Minister is presenting to us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#F02800","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I respect the Deputy's view but disagree with it.

My understanding is people have talked about this for decades.  Doctors hired by Holles Street in the 1960s were asked when they were going to move to co-locate with the adult hospital.  The process as we understand it now began in 2013 when the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the intention to move.  This was on the back of a KPMG report, which he received.  In July of that year, the campus project board was established by the HSE and in 2015 a memo to Government on the relocation of the Coombe and the Rotunda, which we should talk about on another day, noted the recommendation that Holles Street should move to Elm Park, in effect.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the Mulvey agreement was brought together.  My understanding is the negotiations were complex and at times difficult so Mr. Mulvey was brought in to chair that.  The Mulvey agreement was put together and, in essence, the corporate structures and what we see today came out of that agreement.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and she may want to add her comments on it.  In 2017, there was a memo to Government from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, with information on the relocation.  Planning permission was secured in 2017 and in 2018 there was another memo to Government on the relocation and agreement in principle on some of the key areas.  In 2018, the contract for the first phase was announced.  As the Deputy will be aware, significant works have already happened, such as pharmacies, car parks and so forth.<\/p> <p>  What changes have been made since then?  In essence, we have moved from a 99-year lease to a 299-year lease, or from 100 years to 300 years.  We have moved from one public interest director to three.  It was one-four-four; it is now three-three-three and, critically, we have written the constitution.  All parties have been involved in that.  The constitution is essential to all this because it is the operating manual and the legal instructions for how the NMH will work.  What we have done with it is very important.  We are not only guaranteeing clinical and operational independence through the constitution, which everyone has rightly demanded, we have gone much further, which I am advised by the Attorney General is either very rare or unique.  We are not just saying the new hospital can provide all services; we are saying it must provide all services.  We have said six times in the constitution there can never be any religious influence whatsoever.  The board of directors is obliged under its constitution to ensure all services are provided.  As a final certainty, the Minister for Health has the power to intervene at his or her discretion to ensure that all services are provided without any religious influence at all.  The three big changes are boards of directors, the lease and the constitution.<\/p> <p>  With permission, Mr. Devane will come in on the matter of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#G00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":710,"content":"<p>We had a number of very good, very detailed and very robust debates over the past 12 months to try to address all the issues people are legitimately concerned about and to which they want to see a solution.

We wanted to see some of the details on the duration of the lease consistently written into all the documents across the whole agreement.

All those fears and concerns that were raised have been very adequately dealt with to the point they are not being raised anymore.  It is now all about governance and ownership, but let us not forget the most significant points raised regarding the national maternity hospital were that all procedures and interventions necessary for women's health would be somehow jeopardised under this structure.

I thank all the witnesses for the work they do and for coming along here today.<\/p> <p>  I have to say that I feel that we are in the middle of something really weird.  Drip-fed bits of information keep coming at us, as elected politicians.  We are not getting the full truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  For example, the Minister has just told the committee this morning that parts of the new national maternity hospital will be occupied by other elements of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that have been displaced.  He cannot clarify for us if that will all be public, all private or a mixture of both.  I find that really upsetting.  We are getting this drip-fed information bit by bit when we have an opportunity to delve down.  <\/p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane said that for the last year they have been debating and robustly listening to queries about this project.  Yet, we have been in here asking questions for the last year and we have been getting no answers.  I do not know how many times most of us in the Opposition stood up in the D&aacute;il to ask for full debates about the future of the national maternity hospital.  We are now getting it, after kicking up a fuss and having been told that we are guilty of a campaign of disinformation or misinformation.<\/p><p>The Minister has come in today and is remembering the moment of repeal and the seismic shift that was for the women of this country.  Members of the Government engaged in that campaign, whether they were knocking on doors or advocating for it and that was helpful but repeal changed everything.  When you look back at the history of the debate, discussion and negotiations around the new national maternity hospital that go back to 2012 and 2013, it seems to me from what the Minister has told us today that the bones and structures were all agreed pre-repeal.  How much did post-repeal Ireland change that discourse and discussion?  It must have changed it.  A lot of that discourse and discussion took place when the sisters or nuns were still on the field.  We are told that they are gone from the field and we are repeatedly told that no religious influence will be allowed.<br\/><br\/>I want to put the following thesis to the Minister.  In the same week we got the announcement that the Cabinet was about to sign off on this arrangement the US Supreme Court leak happened.  It was leaked that Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade was about to be seriously challenged and possibly taken down.  For me, as somebody who has fought for repeal and abortion rights all of my life, that was shocking.  I understand, as many women in this country do, that for women's healthcare and reproductive rights you make two steps forward and you can take four back.  That happens because there will always be a kickback and a backlash against women's rights.  That is part of the way our society has been structured.  Women's oppression has always involved us making gains and them lashing back against us.  Religious interference does not always appear in nuns with long veils traipsing the corridors in the image of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead.  That is not what we mean when we talk about religious interference.  We mean a deep-seated and deep-rooted prejudice and an in-built thinking about women's health that goes into the heart of the Civil Service, the health service and the political establishment.  It is something that cannot be seen and it does not wear a veil but it traipses around our bodies and lives all of the time and I am seriously worried that this concern will be dismissed.  The Minister said six times that it is in the Constitution, that there will be no religious interference and that this cannot be true.  That is nonsense and that is not the way it works.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted that the Minister acknowledged this morning that there is a much more deep-seated sociological reason for the mistrust around this deal and that it is not just headcases like me or others giving out misinformation.  There is a deep-seated reason for it.  We have to deal with that deep-seated reason and to do so we need much more than we have had until now in terms of reassurances from the Minister that there will be no religious interference.  For that we need to know why the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will have deep-seated and deep-rooted ties to the religious orders, will have the right to appoint three board directors and to appoint the chair every few years.  Why does it have that right?  If this is to be an utterly independent national maternity hospital for the women of Ireland to deliver all reproductive and maternity care then why does it want that interest?  It seems to really and passionately want it.<br\/><br\/>Its fact sheet is extremely interesting and it does not provide the sort of facts the Minister gives us when he repeats that we own it.  Mr. O'Donoghue keeps telling us that we &quot;effectively&quot; own it because of these leasehold rights but we do not.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land and the rights and that it is on the board because of this, that and the other.  I am deeply suspicious of its interest in this project.  The Minister for Health was involved in devising Sl&aacute;intecare and I do not understand why we would use all this public money and this opportunity to create a truly one-tier medical system with no discrimination against people based on the depth of their pockets or the size of their wallets with a clearly publicly-owned and funded national maternity hospital in this way.  Why do we not take the opportunity to have that?  That is clearly not what we have and the plot thickens when the Minster tells me about the private elements that will be in the building and about the clinical independence.<br\/><br\/>Somebody mentioned Savita Halappanavar.  I think of her every day but I did not want to mention her name.  However, now that she has been dragged up I want to say that as she was dying, somebody took a decision that it was clinically inappropriate to give her the abortion that she and her husband asked for.  Somebody took that decision and even then, pre-repeal, it was legally permissible to do that to save her life.  Clinical appropriateness can be decided by somebody who does not agree with my view of the right to choose and of a woman's control of her body.  That could still happen with that the phrase &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; mixed up with the term &quot;legally permissible&quot;.  It is obfuscating in terms of where women stand.  What about what they want, rather than what the clinicians want?<br\/><br\/>We need to delve down into this much more and we need more time and reassurance.  If we removed the ownership of the land from the equation, we would get rid of this labyrinthine structure that has been described as Kafkaesque, involving three boards of management with three constitutions and three ways of appointing people and the State would deal directly, once and for all, with the future of women's health.  I would like the clinicians and the Minster to address those concerns that I still have, despite this long debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#K03400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":839,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the Deputy and I appreciate her acknowledging that this is a deep-seated mistrust that goes back for generations and it is understandable that this mistrust is there.  I will make a few quick points as follows.  First, a view has been expressed that we could just own the land and the building and that it could be a HSE hospital.  We could take the current national maternity hospital out of it and it could be a HSE-run hospital.  There are 19 maternity hospitals or units in the country and at the start of the year, ten of them provided services.  By the end of the year 14 of them will provide services, so we are all moving in this direction.  There are 11 maternity hospitals providing services right now and the eight that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.  We own the land and the buildings in those hospitals and there are no voluntary structures there whatsoever.  The hospitals that have led post repeal are the voluntary hospitals and the people sitting with us today.  The idea that has been put forward that if they were just HSE hospitals then that would solve the problem is clearly not correct because the eight maternity hospitals that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Second, the ownership of the land is not linked to the appointment of directors.  The land under the National Maternity Hospital, Holles St., is owned by the Earl of Pembroke, whoever that is, and he has no influence.  If the Deputy owned the land and we were getting a leasehold ownership for 300 years from her then she would not be appointing any directors.  The directors are being appointed because this is a partnership.  The national maternity hospital, which does not own the land under St. Vincent's University Hospital, is appointing directors to that board as well.  I might ask the clinicians about this.  Could Ms Brosnan come in on this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#L00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":840,"content":"<p>Before she comes in, I will make a point.

There are very detailed maps available for everybody to scrutinise this.  Much of St. Vincent's campus will be disrupted to build this very large structure.  It is around 50,000 m2 of which 35,000 m2 to 40,000 m2 will be the national maternity hospital's business.  There is another part of that campus that will be shared services, particularly all the catering and all the sterile services department.  They will all be shared and quite a lot of other facilities.<\/p> <p>  The other element is that St. Vincent's current campus will lose a lot of its space.  Procurement, ward areas such as dermatology and transitional care beds all had to be planned into the new service.  There is a very large, long, L-shaped building in the plans.  At the moment it is configured as a red block in the diagrammatic schematic picture.  If you drill down, there is an L shape which is built into five or six different elements, that is, our own big build - hopefully- the shared services and what St. Vincent's needs to build to replace what we are taking over.  It is very complicated because it is a working hospital.  It is the largest campus hospital in south Dublin and Leinster, almost.  A huge amount of work will be required to be done in the middle of a working campus.  It is complicated.  We phased it.  There was originally discussion of doing it in two phases and now it will hopefully be built in one.

We have a statement from these two eminent people who dissented from the decision on 13 March to go ahead with this deal on 14 March.  I think people need to take note of that statement.  The idea that ethos can influence medicine is always there.  We need much more to guarantee that just because the nuns have gone off the pitch, the influence of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have much more weight than it ought to.  I want to thank the two women for taking the courageous step of making that statement.  <\/p> <p>  I am publicly asking the Minister to hold off on making the decision until we delve down much further into what is going on.  I have heard Dr. Mahony repeatedly talk about how bad things are in Holles Street.  I understand that.  I disagree with some commentators who have said it is like a slaughter house.  It is not like a slaughter house.  I have friends who gave birth there in the last year and they got on very well.  We need to calm down a bit.  We need to step back and really delve down into what we are doing here.  We need to give it more time.  If we have given it eight or 12 years, it can take another bit more time to get it right.  We took a long time with the national children's hospital.  That is costing us a load of money but at least it is being built on a campus where they own the land and are sharing the state-of-the-art facilities and medical facilities with St. James's without all this nonsense of three boards of directors and three constitutions and three mixed-up ways of dealing with things.  Why could we not do the same as with the national children's hospital and St. James's with this?  It is because St. Vincent's Healthcare Group do not want it.  It wants a huge influence on this hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#M00800","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":853,"content":"<p>If I might come back in on the comment about the slaughter house.

It is one of the things that is being looked at in the review of the operation of the Act.  However, the direction of travel is very important.  With regard to what is happening right now, this year, we will have gone from ten hospitals to 14 hospitals providing termination services.  That is very important.  This is the second year in which the maternity strategy will have been fully funded.  This year and last year, we have been in the process of setting up a national network of new women's health services in gynaecology, menopause, endometriosis and infertility.  I hope to secure funding in the budget to make publicly funded IVF available next year and to begin to phase that in.  We are introducing free contraception this year, starting with young women from 17 to 25.  Women's healthcare, including all of the services we are talking about today, is an absolute priority for this Government.  An entire national network of service provision is being built at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to say the word \"ironic\" but one of the things that is interesting about this debate is that, although some may have, I have never heard anyone question Holles Street with regard to termination services.  Is it not interesting that two of the members of the board of Holles Street are priests?  One of them, the Catholic archbishop of Dublin, is the chair.  That role is agreed as part of the articles of association of the hospital, dating from the 1800s.  What we are essentially doing is moving the National Maternity Hospital, which everyone accepts is a leader in women's health services, to a state-of-the-art building, to which that hospital is contributing because it is selling its building on Holles Street.  We are putting in nine new directors and replacing all of those old structures.  Right now, we do not own the land under the Holles Street hospital and we do not own the building.  The chair of the board is the archbishop of Dublin.  There are elected representatives, councillors, on the board but there are no ministerial appointments to the board.  That hospital is not obliged, under its constitution, to provide all of these services.  We are moving to a new model and a state-of-the-art hospital co-located with an adult hospital.  The new hospital will be legally obliged to provide all services, any religious influence is expressly disallowed and the Minister and State have the power to intervene if necessary.  It is interesting to look at where we are and what we are proposing.<\/p><p>What we are doing here is taking any religious involvement out.

People have described us as a subsidiary but we are a separate legal entity.  I just want to go through some of the layers.

The first point is that the operation of the hospital is transferring from its charter to a new company, NMH Designated Activity Company, DAC, which is an independent legal entity.  That provides protection of itself because company law means that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will, from the outset, have very limited scope to interfere.  On top of that, as the Minister has said, the next really important piece is the constitution of the DAC, which is really and truly enshrining all of the values and principles that we considered so important, when we were designing this, to protect women.  The principle, which is now enshrined in the legal framework, is that the hospital will have clinical, financial and operational independence and without getting too legal, we will be able to provide all legally permissible services without religious ethos or other distinction.<\/p> <p>  The next layer, and the really big piece, is the reserved powers which cover the independent operation of the hospital.  They are exercised independently by the directors and any service that is legally permissible is available.   We also have the Minister's direction to ensure that those reserve powers are exercised.  People keep saying that this hospital is a 100% subsidiary but it actually has a really special share, called a golden share.  That golden share is held by the Minister and it has very special powers.  It protects the inviolability of the reserve powers and ensures that the director's obligations are provided for.<\/p> <p>  The next layer is the board of directors.  We have heard a lot of comment about directors and some suggestions that directors coming from St. Vincent's would act against the interests of women's health.  That is very egregious.  When one is a director of a company or hospital, one takes it very seriously.  One has a fiduciary duty to ensure that everything one does is for the benefit of the patients one is serving.  When one is on a board - and I am on a board - everything one does has got to be to the benefit of the patients one serves.  It is wrong to suggest that directors would break their fiduciary duty when we do not even know who they are yet.  That is very unfair.<\/p> <p>  The operating licence from the HSE is another layer which gives us freedom and independence to protect.  Then we have an ownership lease, which is giving us 299 years on the site, and we have a board and the mastership system.  These are all the layers and that is even before I get to explaining that there is no religious ethos at St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's is now a secular hospital under the current board.  Again, people are saying that the current board is some kind of proxy for the religious but this is the very board that spent the last number of years separating the hospital from the church because it wants to emerge into the future as a hospital whose only ethos is delivering the best national and international practice of care for the patients it serves.  This is the very board that has removed a religious ethos.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>That was extremely useful and I thank Dr. Mahony for it.<\/p> <p>   I spoke to the Minister last night about the issue of \"clinically appropriate\" services.

It is certainly what people have said to me.  I do not think the line is helpful for the Minister in this debate.  The Labour Party position is that we hand over too many projects or State assets to voluntary bodies.  We are moving forward in Ireland.  I appreciate that everyone here is painstakingly explaining to us the different structures, layouts and set-ups but, ultimately, it still seems to boil down to, and this is a public perception, this not being a State-owned building on State-owned lands.  This is the crux of the matter.  People are unable to marry these two things together.  I do not know that we will be able to come out of this committee having married those two things together because I think this is how the public feels and I do not know if a huge amount can be done about that.<\/p> <p>  I find it difficult to follow some of the companies, set-ups, people and complicated lease agreements.  It is company after company and I feel like we are going to end up in the Cayman Islands.  I am trying to follow these things.  This is not in any way to suggest that anything is going to end up there.  It is a complicated thing for members of the public to follow.  Things that are making it difficult to follow include the fact that some pieces of the paper trail may be missing.  Some of the stuff has been drip fed to us.  It has been a bit of a sprint effort to go through the documents released last week.  Two things are missing.  We are bringing the Vatican back into this so forgive me but in respect of the agreement was sought between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity, whatever that agreement or paper trail was, we do not have sight of that.  That is a cause for concern for the public because we do not know what was agreed.   Maybe someone here has seen that but I have not seen it.  People have not seen whatever the conditions of the agreement are.  This land is extremely valuable.  It is a valuable asset.  It is hard for people to believe that the Vatican just went \"there are absolutely no terms and conditions.  You can just do whatever you like with it.\"  If it has said that, it would be really helpful for members of the public to see that paper trail.  <\/p> <p>  Another thing that is a sticking point in public understanding is the fact that what is in the table today is a slightly different agreement to what was touted in 2013.  My understanding is that this change took place around 2017.  It feels as though there was a change in how this would going to look.  We went from public land and public ownership to this agreement.  Has the Minister had sight of or examined the correspondence between the former Minister, Deputy Harris, and his senior officials around 2017 outlining how we got to the current agreement?  Can this be made publicly available because this is something of a sticking point for a lot of people?  <\/p> <p>  There is a question around the issue of indemnity in the share transfer agreement.  I know a couple of legal experts, and I would welcome the Minister's own legal opinion on this, have said that some of these terms of indemnity are perhaps vague and could even cover the Religious Sisters of Charity holding company, RSC Caritas.  Is it correct to say that the indemnity will extend as far as that?  If so, is it appropriate for the State to give that indemnity to it?  <\/p> <p>  What happens if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  We have this layered system.  What is the legal follow on if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  Could the Minister elaborate on who owns what because these are the questions that have come into my inbox?  Who would own what if the Religious Sisters of Charity was to cease to exist within the next 300 years, and we do not know what that will look like?    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#R00400","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":908,"content":"<p>The first two questions are around this ask from the Labour Party and others who say they want a State-owned building on State-owned land.  I understand fully why people want that.  The point I was making previously was that this does not provide the guarantee that people may be demanding because when you look at the remaining maternity hospitals or wards that do not provide them, you can see that they are all State-owned hospitals on State-owned land.  By definition, that model does not guarantee what people want.  In fact, it is the voluntary hospitals that have led the way on this.  Regarding the Senator's very reasonable question about why the HSE hospitals are not providing these services, this year, we will have moved from ten to 14 so we are moving quickly in the right direction.  Partly this is because we are directing funding.  I have ring fenced funding for termination services so several hospitals have the money and investment.  We are investing at a level never seen before in maternity services, gynaecology, menopause and endometriosis - a wide variety of areas.  All of this money coming into our services is one of the things helping these hospitals to do it.<\/p><p>The question was about why we cannot get HSE hospitals to provide services.  I respectfully answer that we are doing so.  We are moving from ten to 14 and I intend to move further.  We are all interested in the review of the Act, which we will debate here.  That is another mechanism that we all want to use to identify the final blockages and to get rid of them.<\/p><p> On the matter of having a State-owned building on State-owned land, we will build the building and it will be ours.  We hold the operating licence, appoint three directors and the Minister can intervene at any time to ensure that all services are being provided and that there is no religious influence in the hospital.  The State has strong involvement in this new national maternity hospital that we do not have at all in the current National Maternity Hospital, yet it is a leading hospital.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to decide on the land issue.  I would prefer for us to own the land.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I asked for that.  The position of St. Vincent's from the first day is that this has never been negotiable.  The original agreement was for a 99-year lease, which has moved to 299 years.  The conditions are essentially that we run a healthcare service on it, for &euro;10 a year, which is basically free.<\/p><p> There is a question about whether we could try harder to get St. Vincent's to give us the land.  It would say that it is doing so, for the next 300 years.  We cannot get freehold of the land.  Others have very reasonably asked if there could be a compulsory purchase order for the land.  I asked that of the Department.  The answer is that we could try, but I received legal advice that there would be no guarantee of success, because we would have to prove that it has to be built there and nowhere else in Dublin and that 300 years is not enough for us to have lease ownership for a building with a useful life cycle of 50 or 60 years.<\/p><p> Secondly, this is a partnership.  It would not surprise me if an involved party said we approached it, asked for a partnership and that it gave us the land for 300 years, and that if we are now going to bring it to court, it is not interested in a partnership since that does not feel like a partnership.  It comes down to whether we are willing to move to another site.  Those advocating for it present it as a viable alternative.  Unfortunately, we cannot own the land, but could we build somewhere else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#R00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Will the Minister answer my question on the indemnity?

Many of the shared services for the entire campus will also be provided at the maternity hospital and university hospital.  We are building shared services for the entire campus as part of the national maternity hospital.  I was recently in Texas Medical Center just outside Houston.  I am told it is the biggest healthcare campus anywhere in the world.  It is a voluntary healthcare campus, with a huge variety of healthcare providers.  Despite that, there is one owner of the campus, which is the Texas Medical Center.  St. Vincent's is applying the same logic here.<\/p> <p>  I am in the realm of speculation now, so forgive me.

From St. Vincent's perspective, it has to ask what the long-term motivations of the State are.

I followed the debate from my office and while here in the committee room.  As it was going on, it struck me that Mother Mary Aikenhead passed away 164 years ago or thereabouts.  She was a physician.  All the way along, we have been debating something that needs to happen.  We need advanced modern healthcare for the women of Ireland.  I do not believe that physician who has now found her eternal reward, or other such people, would want to put any barriers in front of modern healthcare.  If she could somehow communicate to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, I do not believe she would say that it is truly representing her beliefs.  Quality of healthcare is what her life was all about.<\/p> <p>  Like the previous speaker, I will get to asking my set of questions.  Our time is limited.  I have a political question, a legal question and a health question.  My first question is for the Minister.  I am sure he and his advisers have done a hell of a lot of troubleshooting on this.  They have probably modelled different scenarios.  If the Cabinet, the Government and the body politic reject all of this, what is the drawing board to which we will go back that ensures State land, co-location and delivery of a modern hospital in a quick timeframe?  If we go to that other model, what would be the approximate timeframe?  Surely there would be a significant delay.  Have the Minister and his advisers carried out troubleshooting on that and modelled it?  What delays might we face if we all reject what is on offer and go with a plan B that has yet to be even thought of?<\/p> <p>  Are there cessation or break-out clauses, as Senator Hoey asked, if the Sisters of Charity cease to exist?  A modern building built in the 21st century is unlikely to be still standing in 300 years.  It will have to be demolished and rebuilt.  There are surely some break-out and cessation clauses.  I would like to hear about them.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue and Ms O'Sullivan.  There is an unfortunate saying that doctors differ and patients die.  I am sure it is the same in their world as well.  What do they make of the legal advice that was circulated overnight from the Uplift movement?  It is from Stephen Dodd, senior counsel, and relates in particular to the whole compulsory purchase order, CPO, argument.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has repeatedly met politicians and stated there are layers of protection.  A question I have been asked, however, is that if each layer is sufficient, why are there multiple layers of protection, up to and including a golden share?  I ask the Minister to explain to those who are tuned in to these proceedings why there are so many levels of legal protection.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Mahony and Professor Higgins.  It is a medical question.  Are their fellow obstetricians and gynaecologists currently limited by any religious, legal, political or ideological barriers in terms of delivering a full suite of healthcare procedures, up to and including abortion, in the current National Maternity Hospital?  Are they limited in any way?  They have probably answered my next question already but I will ask it nonetheless.  Do they believe that, going forward, if they do move - lock, stock and barrel - to the new national maternity hospital, any of the legal protections or political agreements that have been hammered out will be impediments to them carrying out their work?  What do they make of what Dr. Boylan has been saying in recent days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#T00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":926,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

We can do so again.  She laid it out very well.  The Deputy also asked another question.  We can come back to it.<\/p> <p>  As regards how long it would take to start again, there is no way to accurately answer that question but my estimate, based on how long it takes the State to build hospitals, is that it would add ten to 15 years to the project.  Some people may say that sounds like a very long time, and it is, but, unfortunately, the State takes a very long time to build hospitals.  We know that from the hospitals in which we are involved.  Would we get another adult hospital to agree to co-locate?  That may be the case.  It may be just a stand-alone maternity hospital.  That would take a very long time.  One must remember that even if we did that and it was a decade on, let us say, and we were discussing a final Cabinet decision on a new hospital, there is no guarantee that we would not be having some version of this debate.  I will be bringing recommendations to the Cabinet in respect of locations for three elective hospitals.  There is debate in respect of where they should go.  All present know there was a big debate in respect of where the children's hospital should go.  No matter what hospital proposal is brought forward to be considered by a government, there always seems to be good and healthy debate because people have different views and they want the right answer.  It would add a very long period to the project.<\/p> <p>  On a human level, the idea of walking across Merrion Square and into Holles Street hospital to tell the clinicians who work there that we had the most exciting and important investment in the future of women's healthcare ready to go but failed to deliver it and we will be back to them in a decade with another site is unthinkable.  We, as politicians, must not allow that to happen.<\/p> <p>  Ms O'Sullivan or Mr. O'Donoghue may wish to respond on the break clauses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#T00600","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":927,"content":"<p>I will take that question.  The lease is for 299 years.  The only way it can be terminated is if there is a breach by either party.

It sets a deadline for shovels to be in the ground and building to start.  We have seen for how long this has gone on so far.  If the State does not do that, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site.  That is not in question.  There would be nothing on it.  To be clear, if the State breaches its obligations during the 299-year term, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site and the building on it.  The obligations on the State are to build a hospital and ensure public healthcare is provided from that hospital.  If it does not do so, St. Vincent's is entitled to take back the site and the building on it.  As the Minister mentioned, if the building is no longer fit for purpose 70 years from now and the State decides it wants to convert it to apartments or to build a shopping centre, St. Vincent's can take back the site and whatever building is on it at the time.

We have to come back a little bit to the history of the Mulvey agreement because the nuns have gone now, they are out of the picture, but in 2016 they were not.  We knew they might be leaving, but we had to create an entity where it did not matter whether the nuns left or not.  We had to create an entity where we had absolute independence in our company.  That is why we have all the layers.  In the initial mediations we were going to be a branch and being a branch does not give you the same protections as being your own separate legal entity, your own separate company.  We had seen from our colleagues in HSE hospitals where maternity services are departments in large acute adult hospitals that there is almost competition for the funding within the hospital and there are different interests in the hospital such as cancer, anaesthetics and all the different specialties.  Very often, it seemed that maternity services were right at the end of the list.  We wanted our own separate funding as well because when you run a hospital, you need to have control of the building, staff and clinical operations, but you also need to have your own separate funding.  In order for us to achieve that, we had to have a separate legal entity.  We went on a bit of a journey during the Mulvey negotiation.  Two mediations had fallen apart because we were in a branch situation.  We could not accept that because we felt it would not give the right governance structure to provide a dedicated healthcare facility for women.  During the Mulvey talks, both St. Vincent's and Holles Street went on a journey, and we had to understand that it is all about patients.  What we are trying to do here is to create an amazing campus that provides care for women, but also care for adults, one that will elevate Irish healthcare and provide care from birth - from a tiny baby born at 23 weeks weighing 500 g - right up to the end of life.  All the research facilities and collaboration between the two hospitals and the doctors is what is at stake here.  When we look at all the successful academic health centres in the world such as Imperial Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital, there is a list of the top 10, and we want to be one of them.  That is what this is about.  We are ambitious for women's healthcare.

There is an embodied emissions concern about such a short lifecycle for a building, but we also heard that the requirement is that maternity health services would be continued on this site for 299 years.  This is something important which has not got the necessary focus and it would merit elaboration.  While the rent is currently set at &euro;850,000 per year, which is close to &euro;1 million per year, it is waived to be &euro;10 per year, so long as the permitted use, which is subject to the double constraints of being clinically appropriate and legally permissible, continues.  The Minister tells us the hospital is only to last for 60 years, so what happens after that?  Are we effectively committing to building four or five new maternity hospitals in a row on this site and, if we do not do so, will we become liable for &euro;850,000 or &euro;1 million per year in rent for the site?  It is one or the other.

I would like the Minister to comment on those legal issues, and he might also come back on the question of permitted use and the terms \"clinically appropriate\" and \"legally permissible\".

I will give a very practical example of what Dr. Mahony was talking about in the context of having beds and spaces dedicated to women.  I recall working in a general hospital, having just come from working at a maternity hospital where there was a dedicated operating theatre.  One night, a lady presented with ovarian torsion, which is where the ovary cuts off its blood supply, resulting in a major gynaecological emergency.  I was used to working at a hospital where I could bring such a woman straight to theatre after, obviously, asking for her consent because she has autonomy.  I could advise her about the clinical necessity and bring her to theatre.  At the general hospital, I had to go to an operating theatre and advocate for this woman against orthopaedic, general and vascular surgery all looking for the same space.  Ring-fencing, therefore, is incredibly important for women&rsquo;s healthcare which, as the Senator pointed out, was not suitably looked after for many years.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to future-proofing.

They are not perfect and I will, I hope, return to talk to the committee about the issues we have with them, but we can work within them.

That is a service we provide at the moment under the current legislation.  The vast majority of terminations in those cases are provided in the community.  That is where the majority of terminations take place at less than nine weeks.  After nine weeks, we perform these terminations in Holles Street either using medication or using a surgical technique, just because the pregnancy has advanced a bit more and there are more risks of bleeding.  We feel, therefore, that it is safer to perform those procedures in the hospital.  We do not do that many, actually, because the majority of the cases happen in the community, which is totally appropriate.  It is where women can be at home instead of having to come into a hospital.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the experience in Scotland, what we found there was as that service developed and improved, far fewer cases came to hospital because those terminations were being given earlier in the pregnancy when it is safer.  That has been the experience in Scotland and we certainly hope we will follow that.  Even in Holles Street today, we do not perform many procedures under 12 weeks because most are done in the community.  The point about this is that under the legislation, terminations under 12 weeks could be performed in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is no barrier in St Vincent's to performing everything but we have to rationalise services.  At the moment, as regards the kinds of services provided in St. Vincent's hospital, it should be remembered that the hospital has not moved yet so we do all of the routine and normal work, including all of the caesarean sections.<\/p><p>We do approximately two caesarean sections at St. Vincent's per year because we need additional medical backup.  We must remember the hospital has not moved yet.  There is no barrier at St. Vincent's to doing that.  It is just that with the cases at St. Vincent's now, there is a limited gynaecological service and it is generally devoted to cancer.  We are not going to cancel a cancer patient just to make a political point that we can do a termination at less than 12 weeks gestation.

In my non-legal world, I can imagine two people living relatively close together where one has a big old garden.  The other person might suggest selling his or her house if the person gives him or her a quarter of the big garden.  They would be close neighbours and get on very well so would it not work?  The other neighbour might agree and find it interesting but suggest giving a quarter of the garden for the next 300 years for free.  He or she might say, \"Let's do this, it is exciting\".  The other party may disagree and look to bring the person to the courts, trying to get the garden from him or her, and then believe they will live together in harmony in the two buildings and remain great friends.  The other party would clearly say \"Thanks very much but no\" to the offer.  It would not sound very much like a partnership but a very difficult way for them to be great friends.<\/p> <p>  The CPO approach is fraught with risk and, critically, the specific risk of years of extension.

My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue.  If I was in a position to buy a home out in the country, and if I wished to see that passed on to future generations, or loved ones or relations, I would prefer a freehold title to a leasehold title.  That is just a layperson's view.  What rights does the State have after 200 years or 250 years in extending the leasehold on the new national maternity hospital?  Would that happen automatically or would it be negotiated?  What rights do we have as a State after that period?  I appreciate that it is a long time away and I appreciate that there has been an extension from the original plans with regard to the lease, but I believe that the ownership issue is one of the fundamental concerns that people have.  If the State wishes to renew or extend the lease after 250 years what rights does the State have?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00200","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>I will first answer the Senator's first question on buying a house or a property.  As I said previously, many people may not know that they own a leasehold interest because there is nothing wrong with a leasehold interest and there is certainly nothing wrong with a long leasehold title.  It is seen as a good and marketable interest in property.  Anyone on the market today who is buying an apartment will buy a leasehold.  If they are selling on their apartment it is selling a leasehold.  Banks take a charge over leaseholds.  There is no problem whatsoever in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With the 299 year lease between St. Vincent's Holdings and the HSE there is a specific agreement within this document that provides that the HSE will not seek to extend the term of the lease or acquire the underlying freehold.  In certain circumstances where money is spent on land or buildings are built, the leasehold owner would have, under the landlord and tenant Acts, a right to acquire the freehold.  It goes back to the fact that this site is specifically being used by the State for the purpose of building a state-of-the-art maternity facility, on foot of a planning permission that was granted in 2017, and not for any other purpose.  There are some restrictions, including that the State will not sell on its interest to a third party.  That is agreed with St. Vincent's.  It wants to operate a public healthcare campus.  In 250 years' time, if the State decided that it no longer wished to carry out public healthcare, it would need to speak to St. Vincent's and hand it back the site.  It is agreed that it will not be seeking to extend the lease, other than by agreement between the parties.  The parties can agree to whatever they want but there is a minimum 299 year period.  The State will not try to use legislative provisions, under the landlord and tenant Acts, to acquire the underlying freehold.<\/p> <p>  I am very satisfied that the interest the State will acquire by way of a 299 year lease is absolutely protecting the State's interest in that building in order to deliver public healthcare facilities in the future.  If it is decided that a maternity facility is no longer required, in 50, 70, 90 or 100 years' time, and if the parties are happy with that, including the new designated activity company, DAC, that is set up, the State can use this site for other public healthcare facilities.  It does not necessarily have to be used as a maternity facility for 299 years.  That does not breach the terms of the lease.<\/p> <p>  I wish to correct a point that was made earlier.  The permitted use in the lease is to provide clinically appropriate and legally permissible services for maternity, but also any other public health care services.  It has been argued that this wording could provide a third party with a way of preventing certain services being provided.  It does not allow St. Vincent's to terminate any property rights or prevent the hospital being used by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>On the letter of dissent from the two board members, they gave a clear view on the separation of church and State and that it would be better if the State owned the land on which the hospital was built.

The idea that the ownership of the land has anything to do with church influence at this point is simply not true.  The church, the nuns, the priests, the rabbis, the imams: none of them are involved.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular and voluntary healthcare group that we are partnering with.  Whether the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold, whether the national maternity hospital has the freehold, or whether the HSE has the freehold, has nothing to do with the church.  The church is off the pitch completely.  We really owe it to people to keep repeating that and reminding people that the church is gone.  The order is gone and the nuns are gone.  This is a secular healthcare organisation, with both of the groups involved.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made a point about where the governance structure came from.  It is my understanding that it came from the Mulvey agreement in 2016.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and perhaps she will speak to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00500","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>Absolutely.  The legal framework that we are seeing now arises from the heads of agreement that were in the Mulvey agreement.  The Mulvey agreement was a partnership, which was an agreement between three parties: the State, St. Vincent's Hospital, and the national maternity hospital.  We sat down at the beginning of that to see how we were going to deliver this hospital, and how were we going to make sure that we would have a dedicated maternity facility that is totally protected to do all of its services and also protected in relation to budget and operations.  It is not just about termination of pregnancy.  It is about the whole service and having our own funding.  We did not want to be at the end of the line when we were looking for funding in a general hospital setting.  As I said, we had two mediations falling apart because we were going to be a branch.  That really was why we had the Mulvey mediation.  Very early on in that mediation we realised that ethos was not an issue at all and that religion was not a problem.  Actually, as always, the problem was making sure we were not a branch that would be promised ring-fenced funding.  Our colleagues in Cork had had a similar experience when joining a big general hospital and they were told funding would be ring-fenced for them.  It was not so easy for them.  We did not want any ring-fenced funding.  We wanted a proper company structure where we had our own service arrangement and where we had control of our building and control of our staff so we could run our hospital and every aspect of it.  That really was the key of the Mulvey mediation.  As I said, ethos actually was not an issue.<\/p> <p>  On the share transfer, it is important to make the point that when we were negotiating Mulvey, we knew that the nuns were leaving but we also knew that would be a process.  This is also why we made sure that the board of St. Vincent's could have no impact on the operation of the new national maternity Hospital DAC.<\/p><p>To make the point again, St. Vincent's is a totally secular organisation.  The current board has achieved that and it is something of which it is very proud.  It is proud to leave the church behind and to move forward into its future strategically as a hospital that provides great healthcare to its patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>We need to move on, Senator Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#AA00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1076,"content":"<p>To reply to the Minister, I am convinced, but the issue is that two members of the board were not convinced.

It has been a gruelling session, so I will keep my questions as concise as possible and remove any commentary.<\/p> <p>  The first is a legal question regarding the proposed 299-year lease.  Under clause 6.5 of the lease, the HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule, which refers to the building covenant, or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Why would the HSE forgo this right so soon into a 299-year lease under this clause?  Should the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group decide to sell the premises, will that open the HSE and this model to an unseen vulnerability?  There may be a simple legal response to that, but it is one of those matters that leaps out to the layperson when trying to digest all these complex documents.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister.  There is no doubt that this model is bespoke.  Whether one is in favour of it or against it, it is a bespoke model with the golden share element.  If a hypothetical similar arrangement were to come down the line somewhere else and if a future Minister for Health were to ask the current Minister if he would recommend this model to be used again, given his experience, would he recommend it?  I know he has confidence in this particular one but, as a model in the future, would he tell the future Minister to run a mile away from it and to go about it a different way as this was too much trouble legally and politically and that there will always be some concerns and risks inherent in it?  I would appreciate an answer to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#AA00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I will answer first and pass the legal question on.  The golden share in this case is a name but what is important is the legal powers that are attached to it.  There are other golden shares in other situations that may have different legal powers.  Essentially, it means that if for some reason the directors of the NMH fail in their obligations and their duty to ensure all services are provided and are provided without any religious influence, the Minister for Health can direct the board at his or her sole discretion.  It says at the end, for the avoidance of doubt, that the directors must comply with this.

I ask witnesses and members to please turn off their mobile phones.  Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This meeting has been convened to discuss the State-funded programmes T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS, which are both administered by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development, under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I thank members of the joint committee for raising these important State schemes as a priority in our work programme, particularly Deputy Kerrane.  I thank her for assisting the committee secretariat in organising today's meeting.<\/p> <p>  T&uacute;s is a community work placement programme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  The rural social scheme is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen, especially in rural Ireland.  The benefits of both schemes for participants include stable income, better mental health and well-being, and the promotion of safer working practices, while also providing multiple benefits in their local communities by supporting voluntary, sporting and community organisations to improve amenities and deliver vital local services.  It should be noted that approximately 30% of T&uacute;s participants go on to full-time employment, with a further 30% progressing to further training or education schemes.  The remaining 40% would benefit from the opportunity of an additional year on the T&uacute;s scheme to become job ready.<\/p> <p>  The rural social scheme, as I said, is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen.  The scheme was launched by our colleague, member of this committee and then Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in May 2004.  The objective of the scheme is to provide supplementary income to low-income farmers and fishermen who would be unable to make an adequate living otherwise.  Not only does it provide a stable income, but, as I said, it has a big impact in terms of promoting better mental health and well-being.  A key element of this particular scheme is that it is self referring.  Thereby participants can have an active interest in developing and improving their local community.  <\/p> <p>  The secretariat requested a detailed briefing note on both schemes from the Department for members, which has not been received.  I have asked the clerk to write to the Department to express our disappointment, because this is unsatisfactory.  The joint committee&rsquo;s policy adviser has prepared an alternative and useful briefing document, which has been circulated.  I thank Ms Haley O'Shea for her work.<\/p> <p>  As we continue in this regard, I very much welcome to our meeting from T&uacute;s, Ms Ellen Brennan and Mr. Martin Corcoran, co-ordinator and supervisor, respectively, of the Mayo north east LEADER programme.  From SIPTU, I welcome Mr. Adrian Kane, division organiser of the public administration and community division; Mr. Clem Shevlin, industrial organiser; and Mr. Peter Glynn, sector organiser.  From Galway Rural Development, I welcome Ms Liz Macdonald, joint chair of the RSS national committee and RSS supervisor; Mr. Sean Larkin, joint chair of the RSS national committee and RSS supervisor; and Mr. Sean Broderick, RSS and T&uacute;s co-ordinator.

I wish to outline the rural social scheme and why it is so important to rural Ireland and draw members' attention to the challenges it faces.<\/p> <p>  The RSS is a unique programme that provides financial support to low-income farmers and fishermen to sustain a reasonable livelihood and in return, participants are engaged for 19.5 hours per week supporting a broad range of services to our rural communities.  One of the benefits for participants is that it provides a stable income.  With farming being a precarious business, a consistent weekly wage is invaluable to the small farmer.  It also promotes better mental health and well-being.  The increased social contact promotes a feeling of belonging and of making a difference.  Participants share skills and resources.  They forge deep friendships and knowledge of their communities.  Indeed, this element was key to the RSS&rsquo;s ability to provide a first responders approach to the problems presented by the Covid-19 crisis.  It promotes safer working practices, making farms a safer place to live and work.  Participants gain comprehensive health and safety training through programmes such as Safe Pass, manual handling and develop safe practices through ongoing risk assessments and toolbox talks.<\/p> <p>  There are also benefits to the local communities as the scheme provides a local workforce with a strong working ethos and extensive skill set.  Farmers tend to be jacks of all trades and in many cases are masters of many.  They possess a unique and integral knowledge of their built, natural and social environments, helping to provide solutions to local challenges.<\/p> <p>  The work carried out by the RSS is far reaching.  It includes Tidy Towns projects, maintenance of community centres, sporting facilities, churches, cemeteries and meals on wheels.  The range of projects supported also extends from research, cultural and heritage projects, such as graveyard mapping and historical book writing, to retail support and charity shops.  Furthermore, the RSS plays a key role in promoting and preserving biodiversity through cultivating and maintaining parks, walkways and woodlands.<\/p> <p>  The scheme provides supports to the elderly and vulnerable.  Extensive assistance is provided to social service centres and mental and physical health facilities, such as Ability West, the Brothers of Charity and Care and Repair, to name but a few.  The RSS facilitates participants to build long-term relationships and trust with these vulnerable people.  Supervisors also liaise extensively with district nurses and advanced nurse practitioners to establish the service that best fits.  The RSS supports many other rural development programmes and projects.  It would be difficult to find a project that has received funding from Government initiatives that has not relied on the RSS to maintain, sustain and thrive long after the initial investment.<\/p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to the challenges faced by the RSS now and into the future.  For many years, the RSS quota was not sufficient to meet the demand for places.  However, due to the age profile of participants and the current policies governing the RSS, for the first time in 18 years we are struggling to fill quotas.  Supervisors are already fielding complaints and feeling the strains and stresses of not being able to supply the services on which our communities depend.<\/p> <p>  The six-year rule was introduced in 2017, when the demand for places was greater than the number of places available.  This rule means participants must leave after six years.  Therefore, in 2023, many participants will be forced to leave the scheme.  This rule fundamentally opposes the very purpose of the RSS and is nonsensical in the current environment, having negative effects on our communities.  While rumour has it that the six-year rule is under review, it is causing enormous stress to participants who are effectively on notice that they will lose their jobs next year.  We feel strongly this restriction should be abolished immediately.<\/p> <p>  Means testing is another barrier.  Initially, when the RSS was set up, participants' spouses could have an off-farm income of &euro;300 per week without affecting their payment.  This has significantly changed, having adverse effects on the uptake of RSS positions.  Many participants find, as their families grow, they have reduced means disregards and find themselves no longer eligible to participate.  The onerous stringent means test levels need to be reviewed and recalibrated, particularly for long serving participants.  Means testing should be carried out, on average, over a five-year period.<\/p> <p>  Consideration should be given to the precarious nature of farming, which has peaks and troughs whereby a good year can be negated by a bad year.  The scheme is also not financially attractive to the 6,000 farmers in receipt of farm assist.  We recommend an increase to the top-up payment from &euro;22.50 to &euro;50 per week, remembering that our participants are not receiving benefits but are working for these payments and offer a huge service to the local communities.  Consideration could also be given to measures to widen the eligibility criteria, such as allowing the following to participate: farming nieces and nephews; carers under reduced working hours; isolated people with underlying health issues; rural dwellers with transport issues; and rurally isolated single parents.<\/p> <p>  We know there will be an imminent review of the RSS and we emphasise that RSS supervisors are key stakeholders in the RSS.  They possess an in-depth knowledge of the operational and strategic potential of the scheme and are the glue that holds the scheme together.  However, currently the supervisors are not included in any of these forums or the forthcoming review to discuss and seek solutions and improvements to the scheme.  A representative of the RSS national committee should be included in any proposed reviews.  There is also a need for an RSS representative on the Irish Local Development Network RSS-T&uacute;s committee.<\/p> <p>  I draw attention to the long-standing issue of RSS supervisors' employment terms.  Mr. Adrian Kane of SIPTU will address the committee further on this matter.  However, I would like to highlight that the success of the RSS and the reason it is held in such high regard is largely due to the input and nurturing of the RSS supervisors.  It is an ever-changing role with many exceptional varied demands that range from project management, community liaison, social work, health and safety officers, manual handling trainers and many more, while supervisors maintain a positive and supportive manner for participants and communities to accomplish worthwhile projects.<\/p> <p>  Despite us consistently going the extra mile, for more than 18 years the Department of Social Protection has refused to engage meaningfully to address our punitive working contracts and bring them in line with other comparative jobs.  There is an immediate need for the Department to re-establish the tripartite forum, as agreed in 2019, whereby we can collectively address our needs, which include an immediate 15% pay rise and implementation of a pay scale in line with comparative jobs in the same industry; the introduction of an occupational pension scheme; paid maternity leave; and the provision of a travel budget to cover the job requirements.<\/p> <p>  In last year&rsquo;s Government publication, Our Rural Future, the policy reflects on the myriad of opportunities to revitalise our towns and villages.  I hope members can see the RSS is a vital cog in achieving this vision and that we will receive their active support in order to address the issues I have outlined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Macdonald"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Macdonald.

They can probably tell from my accent that I am not from Mayo.  I am from the Dublin south city partnership.  I will not go over the same stuff Ms Macdonald spoke about, but I will outline what the T&uacute;s programme is, what T&uacute;s supervisors and co-ordinators do, how the roles have changed, and the impact on the community.<\/p> <p>  T&uacute;s was launched in 2010.  It is a community employment activation scheme that provides short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  It is managed by 49 local development companies nationally for the Department of Social Protection, which has overall responsibility for the scheme.<\/p><p>To be eligible for the programme, candidates must have been on a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months and be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  They are referred from the social welfare offices or can self-refer.  Up to 30% are allowed to self-refer.  As with the RSS, T&uacute;s participants work 19.5 hours a week for 12 months.  That is a difference between the schemes.  There is a limit of a year with T&uacute;s, so we have quite a high turnover with that scheme.<\/p><p> T&uacute;s plays a key role in social inclusion in rural and urban settings.  We support day centres for the elderly, childcare centres, sports centres, community halls, disability services, environmental groups, heritage services and social enterprises.  We have roughly one to three participants in each community group.  To give the example of Dublin South City Partnership, DSCP, which I work with, we have an allocation of 160 placements.  We work with 80 local community organisations so we have a really wide reach.  That means we are able to provide specific opportunities to the candidates.  We are also able to respond quickly to changing needs in the community.  We run directly projects such as care and repair.  That is a free gardening and handyman service for the over-65s.  We have about 300 regular clients.  We fit safety rails and smoke alarms, set mousetraps and intervene in cases of hoarding, that is, do clear-outs.  These older people do not really have anyone else to help them.  They fall between the cracks.  The model is working in supporting all these local community needs.  The only thing that slows us down a bit is getting the referrals from the Department of Social Protection.  We are ready and well placed to take more people; we just need candidates.  Our placements are key in developing our clients' career progression.  Approximately 30% of participants go on to full-time employment and another 30% go on to further training or schemes, but many of the remaining participants would benefit from one more year on T&uacute;s to become job-ready.<\/p><p> Now I will talk a little about our roles as supervisors and co-ordinators.  We are responsible for supervising up to 25 participants each, following a recent increase in our quota.  We must recruit the candidates and find the placements for them.  We look after all the HR and administrative stuff, that is, payroll, Garda vetting, HR records and reporting to Pobal and the Department of Social Protection.  On top of that, now that a lot of the service has gone online, we find ourselves helping clients to set up bank accounts, phone plans and Revenue accounts and to fill in social welfare applications.  We are like a one-stop shop for providing all that information and support to remove any barriers to employment, so the role has evolved a lot.<\/p><p> Not many people know about what the co-ordinating supervisors do.  Not only do we have all the same duties as the supervisors, that is, we look after 25 participants each and do all the HR stuff, but we also line-manage a team of supervisors.  We are sometimes office managers because we have satellite offices apart from the partnership head offices.  We look after data protection, budgets and strategic planning.  It is essentially a programme management role.  For that we get a top-up of only &euro;5,000 a year.  Essentially, the model is working well the way it was set up, but the resources are a bit stretched.  There are a few things that need to be looked at in that regard.  Furthermore, our terms and conditions are totally different from those of the other partnership staff.  We work alongside other community programmes such as the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and the ability programme.  I went on maternity leave two years ago, as did two of my colleagues at the same time.  They were paid; I was not.  I had to go on State maternity pay.  It was quite unfair and a bit of a kick in the face.  We do the job, however, because we love it and believe in the programme.  There are just a few things that need to be looked at to make it more sustainable and more attractive and to retain the supervisors who know the field well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Ellen Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1211,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Brennan.

SIPTU represents the 400-plus supervisors who work in T&uacute;s and the RSS.  As the committee has heard and will be aware, our members provide an invaluable service to local communities to ensure an effective and professional approach to community employment and social inclusion.  In our written submission we have given an overview of the current services and the necessary structural changes which we believe would greatly enhance the services.  These issues have already been addressed by Ms Macdonald and Ms Brennan in their opening statements.  In my opening statement I will concentrate on the industrial relations framework, or lack thereof, and outline some of the most pressing issues with which we believe the committee may be in a position to offer us some assistance.<br\/><br\/>As for the industrial relations framework, our members employed as T&uacute;s and RSS supervisors suffer the same fate, unfortunately, as most workers employed across the community sector.  They are employees of private companies, typically partnerships or local development companies.  The funding for their salaries, however, comes directly from Government spending, in this case from the Department of Social Protection.  Our members have not had a pay increase for a significant number of years.  As a trade union representing this cohort of workers, we find ourselves in a very frustrating position.  Employers are, in the main, willing to engage with us.  However, they do not have any funds to meet our claims, be that in respect of pay claims, pension provision, sick pay or maternity leave, as the committee has heard Ms Brennan talk about.  We recently concluded negotiations with the Department on a Labour Court recommendation outstanding since 2008 for community employment supervisors concerning pension provision.  That remains unimplemented to date.<br\/><br\/>We note that the EU will soon implement a directive concerning minimum rates of pay and collective bargaining coverage.  It will soon be incumbent on all member states to increase their collective bargaining coverage to 80% of their national workforces.  If the Government intends to give effect to that directive, where better to start, we would argue, than in the community sector, the near abroad, as it were, of the public sector?  I stress that our members do not have any great desire to become public servants <i>per se<\/i>but they do expect their terms and conditions of employment to be fair and to reach a threshold of decency.<br\/><br\/>This limbo-type situation in which trade unions representing workers in the community sector find themselves must come to an end.  Mechanisms in place previously provided for a more normal industrial relations environment.  Between 1986 and 2008, for example, our members in T&uacute;s and the RSS received pay increases which mirrored the pay provisions of the social partnership agreements.  We have outlined in our written submission some of the most pertinent issues which remain outstanding because of the lack of an effective collective bargaining forum for all stakeholders, that is, the Department, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and trade unions to attend.<br\/><br\/>Most lately, on 23 February, we requested that the Department of Social Protection re-establish a tripartite forum which had been in place since 2017, comprised of representatives from the Department, the ILDN and trade unions.  We believe that that was an important body.  We still believe that the re-establishment of such a body is critical to building relationships between the relevant stakeholders.<br\/><br\/>As for pay, the RSS and T&uacute;s play a critical role in promoting social inclusion in both rural and urban settings.  It is our firm belief that the roles of both cohorts have evolved in recent years to such an extent that the 15% differential which exists between community employment supervisors' rate of pay and that of RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors is neither justifiable nor sustainable.  We have approached the Department of Social Protection accordingly, seeking the establishment of an evaluation exercise of the role and duties these workers now undertake.  The purpose of the evaluation exercise is to conduct a comparative analysis of the role and duties of community employment scheme, CES, supervisors and those of RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors.  The rate of the additional payment for co-ordinating supervisors needs also to be the subject of that evaluation exercise.<\/p><p>This is the only objective and fair way in which to validate the basis for any pay claim in reality.  <\/p><p> We have sought to agree terms of reference and methodology for the conduct of this evaluation exercise.  At our only meeting with officials from the Department of Social Protection to date, they informed the unions that they would liaise with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the issue.  It should be noted that the conduct of an evaluation of the work and roles of grades of employees is a normal process to adopt within the public sector where a union believes there is merit in a re-grading exercise.  We ask the committee to use its significant influence to assist SIPTU and these workers in advancing this request.<\/p><p> Regarding pension provision, as the committee is probably aware our members have no occupational pension scheme.  This is, quite frankly, intolerable.  The standard defence from the Department is that it is not the employer.  We think it is a tired refrain and a figleaf of a defence which simply does not wash with our members.  We have sought the immediate introduction of an occupational pension scheme.  We have not been prescriptive in our demands and are amenable to discussions around pension models, contribution levels, etc.<\/p><p> Regarding a worker representation or voice, we believe that workers should be included in the stakeholder bodies that currently exist.  As it stands, SIPTU has no input into the current review being undertaken in respect of RSS.  There is significant unde-rdevelopment in any sort of social dialogue process in terms of the evolution of services and a worker representative or voice on such bodies.<\/p><p> There is currently a structural problem in the payment of travel expenses for members employed in RSS.  There is an effective cap on travel expenses.  This is the cause of much frustration for members and immediate remedial measures to address same would be welcomed.  Schemes will be funded to a sufficient degree which does not see our members out of pocket, something that is currently the case. <\/p><p> Ms Macdonald addressed the six-year rule in her opening remarks.  We believe the current rule in respect of RSS is undermining the viability of the scheme's primary function, namely the promotion of social inclusion.  We would again ask the committee to reflect on the six-year rule and recommend its elimination.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the current situation whereby trade unions are being sent from pillar to post, that is, from the Department to employers, is not now and never was tenable.  Last week, hundreds of community sector workers took to the streets.  They have, on average, not received a pay increase in 14 years.  We have served thousands of claims across individual employments in respect of the very basic terms of building momentum for 3%.  We now live in an economy that is experiencing 7% inflation, something that will be significantly higher by the end of the year.  These people need a pay rise.  I am not just talking about RSS and T&uacute;s, but across the entire sector.  The issue can only be addressed by direct engagement with the Department of Social Protection and a whole-of-government approach.  I ask the committee to take that request away today.  The dysfunctional nature of industrial relations which prevails across the community sector needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Kane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1214,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for the evidence and supporting documentation they have submitted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#D00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1215,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the submission.

I am interested to hear that the witnesses favour abolishing it.  Another significantly detrimental effect on participants' wages is that they now, net of farm income, get the basic rate.  That means that anybody with a partner or children is getting exactly &euro;25 a week for 19.5 hours work.  They must be the lowest paid people in the country.  Perhaps the witnesses can outline how that is affecting interest in the scheme for people in that cohort.  Is it becoming difficult to fill vacancies in the scheme, given that only a finite amount of farmers and fishermen are eligible for the scheme?  I would be interested in hearing about that because it is it is a significant hit on people's income.  When the scheme was originally devised, once people qualified for the scheme they got the full rate for the job when they were under the threshold in terms of their underlying entitlement to farm assist, jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance or whatever else.<\/p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s participants, it was never intended that it be a one-year scheme by the Minister at the time.  I was the Minister at the time and I know what I intended.  That was a decision made by the Department of Finance.  If anyone can remember 2010, it was an achievement to get it through in that particular budget.  It is not meant to be an activation scheme, as such.  The idea was that people would engage in community employment for three years and if they then failed to get a job they could enter a permanent work scheme like RSS.  <\/p> <p>  There are people who will work very well and happily on schemes, but are unlikely to get commercial employment.  It is a myth that everybody in the economy will get commercial employment.  Anybody who has worked with schemes like RSS knows that is a reality.  These people are doing huge work in society at an economic cost.  The biggest complaint I and a lot of my colleague receive is that people want to stay on schemes because they will not get commercial employment and do not want to go back to jobseeker's allowance.  They do not want to have the numbing experience of not having a purpose; they want to get up in the morning and go somewhere to do something. <\/p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on the participants in these schemes and whether there is now a need to reform T&uacute;s and its role to what it was originally meant to be, namely, a follow-on scheme.  People do training and activation and all the rest.  If they failed to get a job, then they go on the scheme.  That would not stop people from moving from T&uacute;s into commercial employment.  If they did not do so, the idea was that they would not be thrown back on the scrapheap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#D00700","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1220,"content":"<p>I will address the issue raised by the Deputy regarding the role of the WRC.  We addressed this committee last year in respect of local employment services.  The Department has refused to attend the WRC.  I have no doubt that if we ask it to attend the WRC it will refuse to do so.  It has used language to state it would assist the WRC.  I am not really sure what that means, but it has refused to attend.<\/p> <p>  We had a Labour Court recommendation with regard to the CE supervisors going back to 2008.  We negotiated an agreement only last year.  The process took almost 14 years, and the recommendation has not been implemented.  The issue that will resolve this will not involve going to the WRC.  I would end up having to refer 50 or 60 cases in each individual partnership or local development company.  We need direct engagement in a collective bargaining forum that has some weight and treats us as equals, as normally happens in a collective bargaining forum.<\/p> <p>  If we go to the WRC or the Labour Court, all we are doing is leading these people on a merry-go-round and nothing will be achieved because the Department will say it is not the employer and is not implementing an agreement.

We have seen the benefits of that in terms of the participants and the service.  It meant so much to people for contracts to be extended and we are seeing the benefits of that.  I would definitely welcome reform in that regard.<\/p> <p>  One of the fundamental issues here about referrals is the referral system itself.  It seems to vary across the country in terms of the referrals from the Department.  Some offices seem to be better than others.  A bit of creativity and effort on the part of the Department might be needed.  <\/p> <p>  Youth unemployment, at 15.8%, is quite very, so there may be a possibility for T&uacute;s to engage on that area.  Over the years, we have seen the fallout of long-term unemployment for youth.  I definitely think there is a role for T&uacute;s to play here in looking at solutions to long-term unemployment for those aged under 25.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we need to start looking at extending T&uacute;s, possibly to two or three years.

What we are doing is asking people to dig into their social welfare payments to support themselves coming out to work.<\/p> <p>  The means test has become very stringent for people on schemes.  One issue we have come across involves a second property that somebody might have inherited.  It is the value of the property that is taken into account rather than the income coming from it.  In many cases, it has been passed on to a grandchild.  One outstanding case of mine involves somebody who inherited a house.  The value of the house was taken into account and the participant must now leave the scheme until they can come up with the funding to get the house transferred to their daughter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1224,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  It is important that we hear from the supervisors on the ground about T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  All the opening statements contained practical suggestions, which shows the benefit of listening to the people on the ground because they know the schemes best.  I hope this will play into the upcoming review of the rural social scheme.<\/p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the age profile of participants in the rural social scheme.  Could they elaborate on that?  What is the current age profile?  They mentioned the struggle to fill quotas.  I know their briefing documentation mentioned the national quota being 3,350.  At the end of March, when we raising the issue of the review and asked when it will happen - we still do know when it will happen - the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, confirmed that 2,969 people were on the rural social scheme and that 1,493 of those will not be impacted by the six-year rule.  That leaves over 1,400 people who will be impacted by the six-year rule.  This is almost half of the entire quota for the rural social scheme so that is of significant concern.  In fairness, the Minister of State has said that as part of that review, he is very aware of the issues raised concerning the six-year rule, which is important.  The work being undertaken by this committee is timely and I hope we can feed into that review.<\/p> <p>  The figures are a cause of concern.  In respect of those figures and the impact of the six-year rule, what do they mean on the ground?  If the figures are correct and the full quota is 3,350, with 2,969 people on the scheme, that means there are 531 vacancies throughout the State.  I imagine the impact of that is that services are not able to run as they should, which has consequences.  I am sure all members agree it is essential for the key stakeholders, namely, the witnesses, to feed into the review and be heard in respect of it.  This is critical.  There is no point in having the review if that does not happen.<\/p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s, could the witnesses speak about the challenge involved in the referrals and the referral process?  I have heard of places that receive a list from the Department and ring people on that list.  Some of them will not bother taking up a place on T&uacute;s and do not actually have to, which is unusual because in many other schemes, people have to take up a place.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that and the level of refusals?  Is this as it seems?  <\/p> <p>  The idea of going from one year to two years should be considered because one year is not much time.  The organisations represented provide a lot of wraparound supports, as does the rural social scheme, and they are really important.  It is not the case that it is \"just a job, any job\" for everyone.  People require an awful lot more in some cases and it is not just a job.<\/p> <p>   Will the witnesses also explain the difference between the T&uacute;s supervisors and the co-ordinating supervisors and the numbers in each?  The independent evaluation is a fair ask and should be undertaken.  I has asked that T&uacute;s be included in the review.  This is not on the table so an independent evaluation of that programme versus community employment would be important.  Given that job clubs are more or less gone now or will be gone in a couple of months and that model is changing drastically, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s are more important than ever for that community-based model.  That is so important because there will be so few schemes left with a community basis.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the pension issue, it has been said by both the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s representatives that they do not have an occupational pension scheme.  Does SIPTU seek a deal for the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s similar to the one that has been done for the community employment scheme?  The issue with the Labour Court recommendation has at last been resolved and while the workers in question have not been paid yet, that will happen.  Is it SIPTU's intention to pursue that?  I know it probably pursued it all along but will it pursue it more vocally?<\/p> <p> All the witnesses mentioned the lack of a forum.  That is important.  Regarding the Department, the Irish Local Development Network, the trade unions and the tripartite forum, what is the issue with the Department regarding why that collapsed or did not work?  What did the Department say to the witnesses when they raised that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#E00400","speaker":"1604"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>The reason the age profile is higher rather than lower is that an awful lot of younger farmers will not depend on a scheme.  They have gone back into full-time employment and are farming part time.  The older farmers aged in or around their 50s are the people on the schemes and need the schemes more because the chances of them getting back into full-time employment may be far slighter than those of a younger person.<\/p> <p>  The referral system for T&uacute;s is not getting enough referrals.  We have lots of work placements in which to place people but the supply of referrals coming through from the Department is inadequate.<\/p><p>As Deputy Kerrane mentioned, many of the people we contact do not want to engage with T&uacute;s, although they declare on the initial letter to the Department that they are interested.  Really, all we are doing is going in a circle in that respect.  There are names coming to us and the people refuse to come out to the scheme or do not engage with us.  They revert to the Department and say \"Yes\" to the next letter.  We are really going nowhere.<\/p><p> On the eligibility criteria for the rural social scheme, it would help us quite a lot if they were opened up a little more.  There are many people, especially in counties down the western seaboard, who have the niece or nephew of the original herd owner doing the farm work but because the uncle or aunt has not signed over the place to the niece or nephew, they are not eligible for the scheme.  They need it but they cannot participate.

We are quite lucky at Dublin South City Partnership because the office we deal with, which I will not name, is really good at sending these over.  Maybe the internal system in the Department of Social Protection is not working as well.  I know it is setting up a completely new office to deal with that, which we really welcome.  We tend to get the same clients referred to us again and again.  They might not be coming on to T&uacute;s because they are not eligible for T&uacute;s; they may be on a disability payment or in full-time education, for example.  It is not that people are refusing but rather that they are not eligible for the programme.<\/p> <p>  We get a few refusals.  I spoke about the variety of placements that we have.  We get people who initially do not want to come on to T&uacute;s but once they come in, speak to us and see the opportunities that are available, they usually change their minds.  It is just a matter of getting them in the door to meet us and see what are the opportunities.  Our ethos is to look at what they want to do for their own career and find a placement to suit that rather than the other way around.  That works pretty well.  I am not overly concerned about the level of refusals but we definitely need more people.  It was only a couple of years ago it came out that we were able to take on self-referrals.  Until a couple of years ago, we were not allowed to advertise T&uacute;s placements.  Many people do not know about T&uacute;s.  It is only recently that we are starting to promote the scheme around the place.  As the word gets out, we might be able to get more people that way.  Currently, we are really relying on the social welfare direct referrals.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about the difference between supervisors and co-ordinators.  I indicated what supervisors do in looking after participants, doing the paperwork and everything, as well as developing links with community groups.  The co-ordinators must oversee all that.  As mentioned, we have huge reach in the community and I must ensure that as the role of supervisor develops, our staff are trained to deal with that appropriately.  It is about ensuring all the supervisors get proper training in supervisory management, for example, and data protection because of all the new information we must hold on to.  It is stuff like that.  There is also all the reporting that goes with that.<\/p> <p>  Self-referrals are also coming in and there is a need to promote and strategise more for the programme.  It is very time-consuming.  It is a dynamic programme but all the management is a lot to take on for the &euro;5,000 per year plus all the stuff that supervisors do.  That is the difference between the supervisor and co-ordinator.  The co-ordinator manages the programme, basically, and oversees it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Ellen Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1228,"content":"<p>To reply to Deputy Kerrane, the running theme here relates to referrals, which are the key problem.  It is very important for us to have that working well because we need that provision of services.  There are a couple of measures that we see that would improve that volume of referrals, which is key.  For example, a participant may claim for a partner and there is no provision for them to refer to T&uacute;s because they are not accountable to the social welfare system.  They are being claimed for by somebody else.  Therefore, they are not eligible to come on T&uacute;s at any point until they open a claim in their own right.  That would free many referrals and it would really improve the volume.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect relates to people who are over 55 and that bit closer to retirement.  There should be a provision that anybody on the T&uacute;s scheme should be allowed to stay on, if they so wish, in conjunction with the T&uacute;s supervisor.  That is a key element relating to experience and provision of services because the services provided are fundamental to many end users, such as meals on wheels.  Many people depend on that service.  Much of this is operational and in some cases it may be nearly cost-neutral.  It is something the Department of Social Protection must look at in order to increase the volume of referrals.

I am very familiar with T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, which are vital for communities.  Social inclusion has been mentioned a number of times.  For any community in which our members are involved, both the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s are essential for that.<\/p> <p>  A number of my questions have been asked already but I will speak to a number of points.  I will first address SIPTU.  When we met this time last year we spoke about the union meeting representatives from the Department.  Has that happened and how many times has the union met departmental officials about this matter?  Have there been specific meetings about the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s?  Will Mr. Kane let us know that because I know it was his wish when we discussed it the last time he was here?<\/p> <p>  With the T&uacute;s scheme, I am aware of a number of matters relating to referrals, which have been discussed in detail this morning.  There is the particular question of referrals of unsuitable candidates from the Department.<\/p><p>Is that a serious problem?  It is something I am hearing about from a number of different schemes, where people are coming again and being referred again.  Maybe one of the witnesses could comment.<\/p><p> I was very taken by Mr. Corcoran&rsquo;s point on youth unemployment.  It is an issue I have brought up a number of times in the Seanad and the wider Oireachtas.  What is Mr. Corcoran's view on how we can target and help that particular cohort of people to get involved with the rural social scheme, but most importantly with T&uacute;s.  The benefit of getting our youth involved with community is essential for the future of our communities.  I am involved with a number of community groups.  There is no doubt we are all of an age where we are looking to the future, and the future needs young people involved in our communities.  Maybe that is a way we can target youth unemployment, which is very important.<\/p><p>With regard to both the RSS and T&uacute;s, supervisor training has been mentioned.  I am aware of the wonderful supervisors who go over and beyond on a daily basis.  Ms Brennan mentioned it is almost a one-stop shop which is getting comments and questions on every aspect of community life and day-to-day life.  Is there enough supervisor training?  What else would the witnesses like to see in the RSS or T&uacute;s?  I know they would like to see payment for that, which is essential and I would support that.  It is unbelievable we do not have sick pay, maternity leave or adequate travel expenses at this stage.  Is there enough training?<\/p><p> With regard to the supervisors, it is essential for the future of both of these schemes that the expertise is maintained, so we have to reward that expertise.  One of the contributors mentioned the love of the job.  That is great and there is no doubt about it, but there has to be recompense to go with the love of the job.  That is what all of the witnesses have asked and it is something that we, as a committee, need to address.  It is essential for our communities that that expertise is maintained and brought forward for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#F00600","speaker":"1684","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>I will answer on the industrial relations side of the questions posed by Senator Wall.  We met last year in regard to the Local Employment Service, LES, and jobs clubs but we have had very poor engagement with the Department since and we have not established a mechanism yet to deal with the impending redundancies in the sector.  We had a meeting with the Department yesterday which was far from satisfactory.  We are going nowhere in regard to resolving that, although we are looking at hundreds of redundancies.  The Department is refusing to step up to the mark in terms of trying to fund what is going to come out of that.<\/p> <p>  To come back to this group, we met with the Department earlier in the year in regard to the RSS and T&uacute;s.  Again, we have not made much progress in terms of a very reasonable request for an evaluation process, which is typical where a grade of employee has evolved, the work has changed and so on.  All we are looking for is an independent mechanism to do that.  Either the claim falls or it has merit, but that objective analysis is something we are up for.  We believe 15% is a huge differential on pay between community employment, CE, supervisors and the people we are representing here.  It is not tenable and it needs to be addressed urgently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Adrian Kane"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>Although I am not a member of the committee, I feel passionate about the rural social schemes and what they do in communities.  I am delighted to welcome Ms Macdonald, Mr. Larkin and Mr. Broderick from Galway Rural Development, which is based in my own constituency, as well as the other representatives.  The impact the rural social schemes have had, since they were first initiated by the then Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, back in time, has been enormous in rural communities, first, for the communities themselves and, second, for the positivity this has created for participants and the network it has created across rural Ireland in terms of the work that is being done, the camaraderie that is there and the benefits people get.<\/p> <p>  I am going to divide my speaking time between two issues.  My first point concerns the participants.  I believe the six-year rule has reached its end of life, if one can call it that.  That should now be taken out and everybody should be allowed to remain on a scheme for the full duration of their time.  At the time when it was introduced in 2017, it was because there was demand to get into the scheme but, at this stage, the demand is for participants to be allowed to remain on the scheme.  We need to adjust it.  The year 2017 was five years ago and we have to review this and make the change.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I have come across is that nieces and nephews of farmers are excluded from becoming participants.  In many cases, that is ruling out good people who could be part of the scheme.  If the niece or nephew of a farmer were allowed to come on a scheme, that would enhance the numbers available and would also provide additional participants for the scheme.<\/p> <p>  We need to look at the participation of people with disabilities in the scheme to make sure we are bringing in people with disabilities and giving them a sense of purpose through an EmployAbility-type arrangement, which would be a first step towards getting work.  It is not that this is job creation, but there is much that could be done for people with disabilities on the rural social schemes, and I know that at first hand.  Those are the things we need to do and if a review is undertaken or if submissions are to be made, they should be considered.<\/p> <p>  There is an inequality with regard to the supervisors and Mr. Kane mentioned a 15% pay differential with CE supervisors.  I am also conscious of the long road it took to get what was got out of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which play one off against the other and put us back and over like a tennis ball when it comes to things like this, and that is being honest.  I hear what Mr. Kane is saying.  The direct route is to get somebody to sit down and independently look at the situation.  That would be a highly sensible way to bring this to a head as quickly as possible so this anomaly is not going on for the next ten to 14 years, as the CE schemes were, only to get something at the end of it which was not exactly fair, although it was something.<\/p> <p>  With regard to eligibility, Mr. Broderick mentioned a case where somebody got a house and, although it could never be rented out, a notional income was put on that house by the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s mechanisms for creating that notional income.  This meant a person had to leave the scheme.  That house will never be rented and it will be passed on to a grandchild and that is in process but, in the meantime, the participant has been penalised.  Overall, that is something we need to look at with the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>  The big ask I get from participants is this.  They are on the scheme and doing their work, and they are delighted to be at it, but when they sit down and think about it on a Sunday, after having dinner and while watching the match, or whatever, they ask, &ldquo;What is in it for us apart from the participation?&rdquo;  The &euro;25 a week is not real when we think of the benefits that are accruing to every community.  Somebody mentioned meals on wheels and there is the Irish Wheelchair Association, cancer care services and all kinds of services that are benefiting enormously from this.<\/p> <p>  I do not have any questions other than to offer my total support to everybody who is here today as a witness to present the case.  I will work with them, as will the Chairman and every member of the committee.  What was set up as a very good scheme in 2003 needs to be re-calibrated to make it fit for purpose again for the next ten years.  It would be timely to do it now.

We are already having to do \"fishes and loaves\" on the ground with many groups.  We are just managing to spread it around, particularly because the rural social scheme, RSS, participants, are happy to go to the extra hours.  They do not count 19.5 hours.  They are there and will go to the 35 hours and will do it.  If the day is right, they will come out on a good weather day, be it a Saturday or Sunday.  They own these jobs and take great passion in doing them.  They have a mileage allowance and we are moving them around.  They are asking to be moved more frequently to be able to meet the demands and there is petrol, and so forth, involved in that.  The amount of money they are being paid is completely peanuts relative to what they are doing.  They really need to be paid a great deal more money into their pockets to be able to do the job but also to feel self worth in the work that they are doing.  They view this as a job and not as a social welfare payment and they are doing this work so that they can better their communities.  <\/p><p> We should look to widening the whole eligibility criteria and there are some areas that need to be looked at.  We have carers out there who are looking after mothers and fathers in the family.  Many of them have had to become carers and to leave the social scheme because they are only allowed to work 15 hours if they are carers.  The rural social scheme asks for 19.5 hours.  It makes no sense.  They are actually leaving work where they are only receiving &euro;22.54 to sit at home and to be more isolated, simply because the Department will not allow them to do an extra 4.5 hours work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022051100002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Liz Macdonald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1237,"content":"<p>It is 18.5 hours in the caring work which went up from 15.5.

Ultimately, it is back to the Department of Social Protection, DSP, because it has the demographics and the data and it is aware of the exact percentages in the various areas.  One thing that would go a long way in addressing the referrals on youth unemployment would be the one year eligibility.  One has to be on a jobseeker's payment for one year to qualify for T&uacute;s.  If one has been long-term unemployed, a year is a long time for a young person and that can fill up with negative things also.  Early intervention is very important there.  That could be controlled by the local DSP office, where it could handle referrals of participants under the age of 25 but each supervisor or scheme would hold a percentage on their scheme for that under-25 group.<\/p> <p>  The other aspect of this is that by removing the one-year rule, one could engage with many of the colleges and the training organisations because once people finish on a Friday, and if they have no job to go to, they should be able to come on with us to get that year of experience so that they can avoid falling into this long-term unemployed bracket.

That is a good way to conclude the meeting.  It is clear from the meeting that the rural social scheme is not an activation scheme and, therefore, should not have a time limit.  We have had evidence that many participants of the scheme work in excess of the 19.5 hours because of the self-worth they derive from the work and the impact in the local community.  Participants see first-hand the impacts it has in the community and they should receive the full rate of payments, irrespective of means.  The current rate at &euro;1.28 per hour is not equitable or justifiable.  This issue needs to be urgently revisited.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Broderick and Deputy Canney raised an important issue concerning someone inheriting a house.  It is a problem across our social welfare system.  We have a perverse situation in this country at the moment.  We have a housing emergency in every community, yet if anyone were to release or rent that house out, they will be penalised by the social welfare system.  It makes no sense to have the Department of Social Protection actively blocking the release of properties for rental in the middle of a housing crisis.<\/p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s, the 12-month limit on participation needs to be urgently revisited, particularly in the many parts of the country where there is no one willing to take up that position when it becomes available.  The three-year prohibition on going back onto the scheme also needs to be looked at, as does the issue of the referrals.  We have seen this first-hand in our part of the country where we are straddling different counties and social welfare regions and the referrals are not coming through.  There seems to be a lack of joined-up thinking on that.  <\/p> <p>  The treatment of supervisors, whether CE, T&uacute;s or RRS,  needs to be urgently reviewed.  They are the linchpin in the success of the scheme and in the engagement of individuals in communities across the country.  The evidence from Ms Brennan on the issue of paid maternity leave highlights the discrimination in relation to it.  We have a publicly funded scheme where we engage with people who, sadly, are on the margins of society and try to bring them back into the mainstream, whether it be in terms of social engagement, self-worth or the impact it has on the local community, and we are not prepared to provide supervisors with maternity leave.  We have heard a lot about issues relating to access, discrimination and participation of women in the workforce.  This is low-hanging fruit that needs to be urgently addressed.<\/p> <p>  I thank witnesses for attending and their constructive and positive engagement with the committee.  It is our intention as a committee to present a report on our deliberations to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, with the hope that the committee's deliberations and recommendations will be taken on board by the Department.

The committee will have received our full opening statement, but being mindful of the time factor, I will only highlight some of the main points in it.  I wish to emphasise Sport Ireland is unequivocal in its stance against abuse, discrimination and inappropriate behaviour at all levels of sport.  Sport Ireland works with 66 national governing bodies, NGBs, of sport, their clubs and their 400,000 volunteers, coaches and administrators to develop an effective sport structure.  These NGBs, clubs and volunteers are the cornerstone of sport in Ireland.  Sport Ireland does not have any direct involvement in the handling of complaints made about abuse and-or discrimination encountered under the auspices of NGBs.  NGBs, by their nature, are independent and autonomous organisations and, as such, are responsible for their own policies and procedures in the handling of these.<\/p> <p>  The majority of referees and match officials are voluntary positions and their safety, welfare and protection is a key priority.  Without match officials, our sports cannot take place.  As such, it is essential that support and training are provided regularly to ensure it is a worthwhile, rewarding and safe activity.  Many NGBs have been proactive in this space, with codes of conduct in place along with sanctions for those found to be perpetrating abuse towards players, officials or referees.  This is important as the voluntary construct of sport in Ireland needs to be protected.  Volunteering in sport needs to remain an attractive proposition.<\/p> <p>  With regard to women in coaching, Sport Ireland recently published a Women in Coaching Toolkit, which addresses the barriers that have an impact on women in all aspects of their coaching life.  The toolkit identifies sexism and gender-related issues among the barriers and challenges females face in coaching and provides suggested actions and helpful documents to assist with overcoming or addressing those barriers and challenges.<\/p> <p>  With regard to dispute resolution, all NGBs are expected to have a form of dispute resolution included in their constitution.  Many of the larger and professionally led NGBs have their own in-house mechanism for dispute resolution. Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland, a service provided by the Federation of Irish Sport, is supported by Sport Ireland and is the mechanism of choice for many of the other NGBs.  All Sport Ireland funded NGBs have updated their constitutions now to include a dispute resolution mechanism in them.  While disciplinary processes play a vital role in penalising and dealing with improper behaviour, they are no substitute for education and the fostering of a welcome and open culture within a sport setting.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the NGB sector, the GAA, the Ladies' Gaelic Football Association, LGFA, and the Camogie Association all utilise the opportunity to report abuse through reporting it in the referee report form, which in turn begins the disciplinary processes for that particular case.  The FAI has established a working group to review the regulations of the association with regard to the physical assault of referees and to consider the wider context of abuse of match officials.  This group has advised strengthening sanctions and suspensions for abuse to match officials by players and club officials while continuing to showcase their \"No Ref. No Game\" message at all international fixtures.  The IRFU established The Spirit of Rugby programme in 2017 to promote and protect the values of the game.  It aims to support players, coaches, volunteers and parents and to educate those within the game about their rights and responsibilities on and off the field.  The charter for Irish rugby outlines the values and every member agrees to abide by the charter on registration.<\/p> <p>  With regard to safety and safeguarding, Sport Ireland&rsquo;s guiding principles and values for sport for children and young people is that it is fun, safe, inclusive and conducted in the spirit of fair play.  A central goal for all involved in children&rsquo;s sport is to provide a safe, positive and nurturing environment where children can develop and enhance their physical and social skills.  It is also important to ensure an example is set for children and young people to ensure they live those values as they grow older and continue to participate in sport and physical activity.  The aim of Sport Ireland&rsquo;s Safeguarding Guidance for Children and Young People in Sport is to help sporting bodies to create a culture of safety that promotes the welfare of children and young people engaged in sporting activities.  The guidance document clearly expresses Sport Ireland&rsquo;s views on the importance of adopting and implementing a suite of policies and procedures, including codes of conduct, disciplinary procedures etc.  Sport Ireland advises that each club or organisation should ensure it has adequate disciplinary, complaints and appeals procedures in place.<\/p> <p>  Regarding codes of conduct, it is noted that codes of conduct are an integral part of any club or sporting organisation. They set a standard of behaviour to help build a club&rsquo;s culture and make it easier to deal with conduct and behaviour issues as they arise.  These can be many and varied, from on-field incidents, sideline abuse and mismanagement to inappropriate social media posts, unfair treatment, poor sportsmanship and more.  Codes of conduct set expectations for everyone involved, from the administrators, coaches and officials to players, parents and spectators.  The code of conduct should be informed by the club and sporting organisation's risk assessment and be a tool for the management of specific risks.  A code of conduct should be in place for administrators, coaches, officials, players and parents.  Such codes outline an agreed standard of behaviour for everyone.  Sport Ireland has developed a wide range of policy and procedural templates, including sample codes of conduct, which we encourage organisations to take and tailor to suit the needs of their membership.  Further examples of work in the NGB sector include the IRFU&rsquo;s establishment of a behaviours and discipline working group.<\/p> <p>  With regard to diversity and inclusion, Sport Ireland is committed to combating racism and all forms of discrimination in sport.  As part of our work in the area of diversity and inclusion, the development of guidance, resources, toolkits and training and education initiatives will be cornerstone actions in the implementation of a new Sport Ireland policy on diversity and inclusion in sport, which is due to be published in the coming weeks.  Sport Ireland recognises the wider societal, structural and systemic challenges faced by marginalised groups in Ireland today.  In acknowledging the contribution of sport, as outlined in the national sports policy, Sport Ireland hopes that policy will be the catalyst to removing barriers and eliminating discrimination in sport.  Furthermore, Sport Ireland will continue our extensive co-operation across Departments and agencies by contributing to national policies and strategies focused on promoting inclusion and tackling discrimination.<\/p> <p>  Through its ongoing engagement with funded bodies, Sport Ireland will continue to encourage the highest standards of governance across all facets of the organisations' operations, including ensuring they have adequate policies, procedures and codes of conduct in place, and that these are augmented by appropriate and robust responses and actions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Una May"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1261,"content":"<p>That was brilliant.

For those who may not be familiar with the work of the federation, we are an independent, not-for-profit, representative body of 110 organisations across Ireland, including 81 national governing bodies, NGBs, and 29 local sports partnerships, LSPs.  The federation&rsquo;s statement today will focus on recommendations for consideration by the committee to aid the elimination of any and all abuse directed towards referees, officials and players in sport.  For more than a century, sport organisations, from grassroots to elite, have provided an extraordinary platform to teach values, create better societies, teach empathy and improve human rights.  Great progress has been made in challenging racism and promoting and creating opportunities for inclusion for under-represented groups, including females, the LGBTI community and ethnic minorities.  However, abuse of referees, officials and players has been referenced as sport's ugly blind spot despite these individuals being essential participants in making sport happen.<br\/><br\/>The Federation of Irish Sport respectfully recommends the following actions on this important topic be considered by the joint committee under the following headings: communications and information, research-training-education, and resources and funding.  Those actions include the establishment of a working group of key stakeholders in Irish Sport to develop and design a national code of conduct for Irish Sport as part of a safeguarding and education toolkit; the expansion of action 2.3 of the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023 relating to an information campaign to include the unacceptability of any and all abuse directed towards referees, officials and players in sport; the appointment of campaign ambassadors-role models to reflect a zero tolerance stance on the abuse of referees, officials and players; and to develop a campaign tagline with a core message to use on all internal and external communication tools such as a core message along the lines:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThere is no place for abuse in sport in any shape or form - Call it out.  Report it.  Stop it NOW.  Sport is an inclusive community that embraces participants, volunteers and officials.  All deserve RESPECT. <\/blockquote> <p>Those actions also include that all official NGB-club websites should have a public statement of compliance or a commitment to a charter to a national code of conduct to have easily accessible complaint procedures to report abuse.<\/p><p> The sixth action we recommend is that all NGBs develop and promote a social media policy to be adhered to by all members, including players, coaches, committee members, volunteers and parents, if they have not already done so.<\/p><p> The seventh action is that the provision of training and supports for administrators with regard to the handling of reported abuse should be added as a key performance indicator under action 4.2 of the Sports Action Plan 2021-2023.  The eighth action is the provision of a suite of resources to assist referees, officials and players who have been the subject of abuse.  The ninth action is the introduction of a requirement for large-scale sport capital infrastructure applications to include evidence of policy and actions that are being undertaken by the applicant on the eradication of abuse directed toward referees, officials and players in sport at both NGB and club level.<\/p><p> The tenth action is the provision of signage at all infrastructure that has received State funding condemning abuse directed towards referees, officials, players and volunteers and the promotion of sport as a safe, enjoyable learning environment for all.  An alternative to this action would be the provision of signage at all infrastructure that has received State funding to outline the terms of admission at the entrances to venues and around the venues.  Spectators or supporters could argue they are not bound by the rules and regulations of the club or NGB because they are not members.  Placing signage detailing the terms of admission around venues may assist clubs and NGBs in arguing that, by remaining at the ground, the spectator or supporter agreed to be bound by those terms of admission.  It is obviously not guaranteed to work but it may assist in acting as a deterrent.<\/p><p> I will now discuss online abuse.  It was recently announced that the Government has agreed to begin the process of recruiting an online safety commissioner.  The federation strongly endorses this decision.  The federation also believes that representations should be made suggesting that, in addition to the commissioner drawing up rules on how social media services should deal with harmful online content, online abuse directed at referees, officials and players in sport should be included along with the matters already stated, which include criminal material and so on.  The commissioner should also be given the power to appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations of online abuse of referees, officials and players in sport.<\/p><p> The 12th action we recommend is the strengthening of legislative proposals to address online harm including the introduction of a new legal framework for identifying and removing illegal and harmful content from the Internet similar those in the Online Safety Bill formally proposed and now adopted by the UK Government.  The 13th action is all media outlets operating in Ireland committing to a public statement of compliance to a national code of conduct on the monitoring and blocking of online abuse in sport. <\/p><p> The Federation of Irish Sport respects the authority of all national governing bodies to govern their organisations and their agreed processes and procedures to deal with the abuse of referees, officials, and players but we believe that an overarching and unifying framework to assist with the elimination of any and all abuse in Irish sport should be considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Mary O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Connor for that very comprehensive step-by-step guideline as to how the matter should be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#C00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1265,"content":"<p>Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach.  I am delighted to be here.  I am joined by Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Conaire, principal officer with our sports division policy unit.  We very much welcome this opportunity to address the committee on this important matter.<br\/><br\/>It goes without saying that both the Ministers and the Department condemn any form of abuse, including online abuse, discrimination or inappropriate behaviour towards anyone involved in sport.  Referees, all other officials, whether on the field or off of it, and players are integral building blocks of our sporting structure and deserve to be respected for the important role they play in sport.  Abuse of officials or players at any level is plain wrong and should not be tolerated.  Everybody involved in sport deserves to be treated with respect and should not feel unsafe or threatened while they are officiating or participating at games.  This applies not just to sport, but to wider society.  While sport has, for example, already played an important role in calling out racist behaviour, there is still much to do both in sport and in society in general.  In that context, the Department of Justice is working to legislate for hate crime and hate speech as a priority to ensure that Ireland is a safe and secure place for all.  This legislation will apply to offences committed where the victim is targeted because of their association in the mind of the perpetrator with a particular identity characteristic such as sexual orientation or ethnicity.<br\/><br\/>The corrosive impact of personalised abuse of participants in sport is well recognised.  A large number of referees and officials are volunteers, and it is appreciated that, without them, most sports could not operate as well as they do or, indeed, survive.  It is important that sports organisations across all sports provide a safe environment for referees, officials and players.  Where abuse and threatening behaviour is aimed at them, appropriate action must be taken by those bodies.  Each of the youth field sports promotes respect programmes.  Where abuse does occur, sporting national governing bodies are asked to use the key disciplinary procedures and sanctions that exist within their organisations to ensure that those responsible are held to account. <br\/><br\/>As Dr. May has already said, codes of conduct are a vital tool in combating the scourge of abuse.  They set a standard of behaviour that helps build a club or sport organisation&rsquo;s culture and make it easier to deal with conduct and behaviour issues as they arise.  Sport Ireland helps NGBs in the development of these critical codes.<br\/><br\/>The National Sports Policy 2018-2027 promotes inclusion with a focus on addressing social, disability, gender, ethnic and other gradients.  The sports action plan launched at the end of 2021 includes a number of actions to address inequalities in these areas.  Sport Ireland has also been working hard in this area and has developed a policy on diversity and inclusion in sport which we hope will be published in the coming weeks. <br\/><br\/>Irish society is increasingly multicultural, and sport has a vital role to play in terms of social inclusion, integration and equal opportunities.  While sport has made significant strides in tackling racism, continued vigilance is required.  The programme for Government is clear on this and states that the Government is committed to adopting a zero-tolerance approach to racism in amateur and professional sport.  Sport Ireland has funded various anti-discrimination initiatives from the NGBs and local sports partnerships.  The promotion of inclusion and integration through sport is an important feature of national sports policy, which is delivered in particular by considerable investment from the Dormant Accounts Fund to support the development and implementation of inclusive sport policies and programmes.  Both of our Ministers and the Department will continue to work on combatting racism and discrimination in partnership with Sport Ireland, the NGBs and colleagues across other Departments.<br\/><br\/>As Ms O'Connor stated, online abuse towards those involved in sport in an issue of increasing concern and reflects developments in wider society.  The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, is making considerable progress towards the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022.  A significant recent development in this area was the introduction of the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or Coco&rsquo;s Law.  Introduced by the Minister for Justice, this has helped to reform and strengthen Irish laws pertaining to criminal harassment, image-based abuse and malicious communications.<br\/><br\/>The Minister introduced the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, which is currently on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  This will, <i>inter alia<\/i>, establish a multi-person coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, enable the appointment of an online safety commissioner and provide for the introduction of a regulatory framework for online safety.  The commissioner will oversee the regulatory framework and devise binding online safety codes setting out how regulated online platforms, including social media platforms, will be required to tackle the availability of certain defined categories of harmful online content.  In particular, on the basis of Coco&rsquo;s Law, online content by which a person distributes or publishes a threatening or grossly offensive communication about another person or sends a threatening or grossly offensive communication to another person will be considered harmful online content.  The risk-based and systemic regulatory approach set out in the Bill will ensure that we are all, across all sectors, exposed to far less harmful online content and provide for an environment in which online services have to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made.<br\/><br\/>The Department will continue to work closely with Sport Ireland, the NGBs and other stakeholders, both in Ireland and overseas, to ensure respect for everyone involved in sport.  In that context, it is noteworthy that under the current EU work plan for sport, which runs to June 2024, there is likely to be a policy debate in 2023 on the topic of ensuring a safe environment in sport.  We will strongly support the holding of that debate as the sharing of lessons and experiences, such as we are seeing today, is a vital input to the ongoing battle against the scourge of abuse in sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1266,"content":"<p>I thank all of the witnesses for their comprehensive statements.

Is there any evidence to suggest that is the case in sports?<\/p> <p>  Any of us who has attended certain sporting events will have witnessed the sideline abuse, the hurler on the ditch, as we call them, and the aggravation.  Despicable and disgusting language is often hurled, whether at the coach or the player wearing the jersey who is doing his or her best to represent the team.  Is it realistic to think we can curb that aggression and aggravation with measures, strategies or legislation, or is it something sport will just have to live with?<\/p> <p>  Our guests might touch on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and how they feel that is progressing in addressing the abuse we have all seen aimed at, in some instances, some very high-profile sportspeople by these anonymous trolls and keyboard warriors who level all sorts of disgusting language at these people who are just trying to do their best?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#D01400","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1285,"content":"<p>I am happy to refer to the question about female officials, referees and coaches in sport.  We have been doing extensive work in the area of women in sport, including a number of surveys.  We are currently carrying out a survey in respect of officiating in sport for women, and we have previously conducted research into coaches and the barriers to coaching for women in sport.  Sexist abuse has been identified, although perhaps not specifically spelled out.  Generally, the commentary we would associate with the issues in this area has been identified as a problem for women in sport in coaching roles, and we have developed a women in sport coaching toolkit that clearly identifies a significant number of recommendations to help and support women to retain, encourage, promote and introduce more women into coaching roles in sport.<\/p><p>With regard to the sideline abuse, our big focus at the moment in Sport Ireland is around good governance.  While we have a very important emphasis on governance in sport and developing governance structures, we have identified that governance alone and new structures, policies and procedures alone do not necessarily effect change on their own.  It requires a change in culture and that is where this comes in.  There are a number of initiatives around sideline culture and respect.  We have a parents in sport week, which focuses on parents' behaviour sometimes on the sidelines, the silent sidelines initiative and a number of other initiatives like that which target specific behaviours.  A culture shift is required, and it requires everybody to know his or her role in sport.  That includes parents and other coaches so that the coach is not trying to be the referee and everybody has a clear understanding of their role within the sport.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#D01500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Una May","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1287,"content":"<p>Does Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in wish to come in?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#E00200","speaker":"1557"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1288,"content":"<p>To come back to the Deputy on the issue of sideline behaviour, as I said in my remarks, it is a reflection of wider society.

These are areas of policy at which the Department of Justice is looking.  I am not sure what the threshold would be in that regard but what happens in sport reflects wider society.  The responsibility then from a sports perspective is on the sports national governing bodies, NGB, to deliver training and coaching to their units and organisations on the standards expected.  Some are better than others in that regard.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, I know a number of further sessions are scheduled on Committee Stage.

If any NGB or sporting body does not take on board these codes of conduct, do the witnesses think their funding from Government should be affected?<\/p> <p>  I have another question on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022, which was mentioned.  I tabled an amendment that would allow the Media Commission to discuss the issues, with wording to the effect that all sporting organisations under the Federation of Irish Sport would insert this Bill into their codes of conduct across all sports.  This would give more governance to people in that each of the organisations would themselves discipline people if they breached it apart from it being done legally.  That wording was not accepted, however, and we are going back to look again at maybe using wording like Sport Ireland that will encompass all sports across the country.<\/p> <p>  Dr. May mentioned disputes in her introduction, and we have Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland.  I will speak specifically to a recent case with which we are all fairly familiar and which needs to be looked at.  We recently had a case where a number of people were suspended by an organisation and were advised to go to Sport Dispute Solutions Ireland.  They won their case yet the costs have gone against them.  These are individuals who give hundreds of hours and, indeed, hundreds of years' voluntary contribution to the sport, and this is what they have been left with for defending their names after having been suspended.  They now have to foot the legal costs for defending themselves and they were found to have been incorrectly suspended.

Although I am a new CEO in the role, I would maintain the philosophy we have always had, which is that we do not use the stick of funding for every area we would like to tackle when we feel there is an injustice or difficulty within a sport.  We have always taken the approach, which I will continue to do, that we are a development agency.  We are there to support, guide and nurture the organisations to develop good practice rather than punish when poor practice emerges.<\/p> <p>  We provide many templates around codes of conduct, specifically with regard to safeguarding young people, and those codes of conduct overlap into all areas, really.  We provide templates for codes of conduct for parents, children and coaches.  It is for all the people involved in the running and organisation of sport as well as the participants.<\/p> <p>  In providing those solutions and reviewing the safeguarding processes we manage, safeguarding is one of the very small number of areas in which we have a very strong link with our funding.  Safeguarding is absolutely critical to ensure that our sports are safe for our young children.  It is an area that is linked with funding.  We are currently in the process of carrying out a club audit around the implementation of safeguarding regulations.  The challenge is, of course, that we are talking about many thousands of clubs, and it is at a club level that we need to ensure these are implemented.  While we can have codes of conduct at the highest level and all the supports we provide around our governance tools, it is at the club level that this is critical.

I agree 100% with her because if we look at sport nowadays, and especially the number of women getting involved in teen sports, we can see the Irish soccer, rugby and GAA teams all doing very well.  I have been involved with sport all my life.  At present, I am chairman of the Louth GAA county board so I am involved with a lot of sport.<\/p> <p>  The issue at the moment is that every sporting organisation is finding it very hard to get officials.  When I say officials I mean referees and coaches.  It is about trying to get people to come and give a hand because the word is \"volunteers\".  These people come along and, to be honest, I noticed in the last number of years that the abuse they are receiving is getting increasingly worse.  The thing is, we need protection.  In her statement, Dr. May mentioned training and supports for these people.  Is there any kind of accountability with the money Sport Ireland is giving to the sporting organisations?  What I mean by that is Sport Ireland is giving money to these organisations, but is the money going to look after the officials and coaches who are doing this voluntary work at the moment?  Is there any kind of accountability for that?  It is very important that there is some way of tracking the money, which is a lot, that Sport Ireland gives to these organisations.<\/p> <p>  Dr. May mentioned that Sport Ireland does not really get involved in the complaints and that it kind of lets the organisations look after themselves.  We are talking about the GAA with referees, rugby with the spirit of the law and a group organisation with soccer.  What I am trying to say is that accountability must be there.   I know myself that as a parent and grandparent, I want to be sure that when my son or daughter goes out there, they are getting the best protection.  In fairness, Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in and Ms O'Connor made the point about social media but I do not care what anybody says - social media and online abuse have a free run.  I know they mentioned the Minister doing this and that at the moment but nothing is being done.  Parents ring me on a daily basis about the abuse they are getting in the newspapers and about the referees.<\/p><p>Something has to be done.  Ireland is a sporting nation and it is great to see everything going well.  I agree with Ms O'Connor, who stated that the abuse of referees was an ugly blind spot.  People believe that money can fix the situation.  It helps, but it does not fix it.  We have no systems in place.  I come from a GAA background, but I am sure that the situation is the same elsewhere.  We need people to feel like they are wanted and that their money is going to the right places.<\/p><p> I do not agree with the comments about social media.  The situation is getting worse.  Someone might say that A, B and C is being done, but it is not.  There are elite sports people who are probably getting more attention than the normal person who plays with his or her club and community.  What are the organisations before us doing to distribute money and look after referees and other officials?  Will they tell me so that I can go home and tell my children and grandchildren that something is being done and that the abuse in the sporting environment will not carry on when they go to work or school the next morning and they can enjoy a normal day without seeing it online or in newspapers?  That is the main issue.

One of the LGFA&rsquo;s initiatives is to increase female participation in refereeing, including by introducing junior whistlers.  Brave lads on the sideline are not as brave if they are abusing a 14-year-old girl.  One might think that that was the point we made.  I ended up being an umpire at my girl&rsquo;s under-13s match a couple of weeks ago.  The umpire on the other side, who was a guy from the other club, started abusing the referee.

Previous campaigns the federation was involved in, like the 20x20 campaign, had a huge impact on the growth of women and girls' sport in this country because people could connect with it and understand it.  I do not think there is anybody involved in sport at any level who would not have witnessed or been involved in abuse at some level.  By creating a stakeholder group of that size. you will get an understanding of what the challenges are and what the opportunities are as well, because we have to face challenges.

That ensures this is not a challenge for us.  Access to disciplinary procedures is not something we have never had an issue with, to be honest.  We have made reference to anti-doping.

I know from everybody here and with the NGBs that is a message that is going out there, but unfortunately it is not getting through fully.  The difficulty is the impact that has.  That impact is felt by individuals on their own well-being and mental health but it also discourages people from continuing to participate in sport.  I am conscious there was an Australian study that showed - some colleagues picked up on this earlier - females who are involved in sport are three times more likely to receive online abuse in particular.<\/p><p>That contributes to discouraging young women from getting involved in sport.  I am also conscious of professional players who have bravely spoken about the abuse they have experienced and the impact it has had.  They are not willing to face work.

It has a direct impact in that they would read social media after games but it also affects them in the belief that they should have to look a certain way and have a certain image.  They look for validation on social media.  I would always say to young girls that if they get onto their local sports field they will validate themselves by participating in sport, and they will get a real-life person validating their behaviours as well.  With Sport Ireland, we recently developed a communication tool for coaches who are coaching teenage girls, to equip both male and female coaches in how to communicate with girls of that age and teach them what is and is not appropriate language.  That is important because we might say something that a girl might misinterpret and that could start the spiral of them dropping out of sport.  We also need to look at how sport is provided to girls of that age level.  From holistic up to age 12, they are having fun and enjoyment and then from age 13 to 17 it is very elite and competitive.  If girls are not making the team they wonder why they should stay playing.  It goes back to the body image aspect as well.

Social media has a role to play in those areas, not so much around the abuse as around how they perceive their environment and contextualise their own participation in sport within social media.  It was not necessarily identified in our research as something which was a key issue or as a barrier for girls and there were very many other broader and more substantial barriers for them.

We are delighted to meet the members and to talk about the Creative Europe programme.  As the Acting Chairman has outlined, it is timely because of Europe Day.  We would also like to talk about some of the other activities we do within the audiovisual and culture sector around our partnerships with Europe.  We have prepared an opening statement and have given some background briefing notes.  We also will leave for the committee some further background briefing documents on the programmes.<\/p> <p>  Creative Europe is the European Union's funding programme to support the culture and audiovisual sectors.  First launched in 2014, the programme saw the previous media and culture programmes come together under one umbrella with a cross-sectoral funding strand addressing both sectors.  The Creative Europe Programme 2021-2027 was agreed and publicly launched in May 2021 and has a budget of &euro;2.44 billion, which represents a 50% increase on the previous programme.<\/p> <p>  The media strand supports the European film and audiovisual industries to develop, distribute and promote European works, as well as funding markets, networking and training opportunities.  The culture strand supports a wide range of cultural and creative sectors, as well as encouraging co-operation and exchanges amongst cultural organisations and artists at European level.  The cross-sectoral strand aims at reinforcing collaboration between the different cultural and creative sectors, in order to help them address the common challenges they face and find innovative new solutions.<\/p> <p>  Through the previous media funding programme from 2014 to 2020, &euro;13 million was awarded to more 80 Irish companies across film, documentary, animation, TV and, more recently, in video games sectors.  Almost &euro;2 million of the overall &euro;13 million was awarded to the audiovisual and video games companies in the west of Ireland, with &euro;500,000 invested in Gaeltacht companies, representing 3.8% of the total Creative Europe media funding to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Beneficiaries include the Cork International Film Festival, the Galway Film Fair, all of Cartoon Saloon&rsquo;s Oscar-nominated animated features and, recently, Element Pictures&rsquo; Oscar-winner, \"The Favourite\".<\/p> <p>  Through the culture funding strand, 98 Irish organisations were involved in projects and activities, with more than &euro;6.3 million coming directly to these organisations.  The successful projects featuring Irish partners covered a range of art forms including visual arts, dance, music, theatre, literature, circus, craft, architecture, design and cultural heritage.  Some notable and interesting projects include: Craft Hub, led by Carlow County Council; Cultural Adaptations with Axis, Ballymun, and Codema, Dublin; and Keychange, with First Music Contact and the Irish Music Rights Organisation, IMRO.<\/p> <p>  Despite the delayed launch of the first funding calls in June 2021 and a shortened application window, the 2021 results for Ireland have been very positive.  While all results are not yet available, the funding total for Ireland to date is &euro;4.6 million: nearly &euro;2.3 million from the media strand; over &euro;1.8 million through the culture strand, and &euro;540,000 under the cross-sectoral strand. <\/p> <p>  I will now turn to innovations in the new programme.  There are a number of welcome changes to the programme intended to facilitate greater access and offer more targeted supports to the cultural and creative sectors across Europe, recognised by the EU as having been adversely affected by the Covid-19 crisis.  The expanded programme provides new opportunities for the Irish cultural and creative sectors including higher co-financing rates in order to expand access to the programme; support for artists and creative professionals to apply directly under the artists&rsquo; mobility strand; support for new sectors such as news media, fashion and sustainable tourism; creative innovation lab; support for journalism partnerships and media freedom and pluralism; stronger emphasis on transnational creation and innovation to make the audiovisual and cultural sectors more globally competitive; targeted sectoral supports including the music, architecture, and cultural heritage sectors across Europe; European media and audiovisual action plan; and media invest, which is a new equity fund designed to help fund the post-pandemic recovery of Europe's audiovisual industry, to be launched in May of this year.<\/p> <p>  Creative Europe Desk Ireland is the designated contact point for the Creative Europe Programme 2021 &ndash; 2027.  The national co-ordinator for the desk is Screen Ireland, which is delegated by the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and there are three information desks focusing on the cultural and creative sectors across Ireland.  The cultural office is based in the Arts Council and is funded by the Creative Europe programme with matched funding from the Arts Council.  Katie Lowry and Aoife Tunney are joint heads of the culture office.<\/p> <p>  The MEDIA office in Dublin is a company limited by guarantee and has an autonomous board of directors.  The office is funded by the Creative Europe programme with matched core funding from RT&Eacute; and Screen Ireland, and receives funding from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, sectoral development fund for events.  Orla Clancy is the head of the MEDIA office in Dublin, which has a national remit to advise the audiovisual sectors on the Creative Europe programme.  The MEDIA office in Galway is a company limited by guarantee and has an autonomous board of directors.  The office is funded by the Creative Europe programme with matched core funding from &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, TG4, Screen Ireland and Ard&aacute;n, and receives funding from the BAI sectoral fund.  Eibhl&iacute;n N&iacute; Mhunghaile is the head of the MEDIA office in Galway and works closely with the Dublin office, while also prioritising the audiovisual sectors in the Gaeltacht regions and the west of Ireland focusing on Irish-language projects.<\/p> <p>  The three offices share responsibility for the cross-sectoral strand of the programme and work together to promote the calls, which include the Creative Innovation Lab and a new news initiative with funding calls for journalism partnerships and media literacy.<\/p> <p>  The remit of the desk is to promote the programmes at local, regional and national level and to provide expert advice and assistance to the Irish cultural, creative and audiovisual sectors in order to facilitate Irish participation in the programme.  The desk gives expert advice on how to access Creative Europe funding and works closely with the companies and organisations in the respective sectors to ensure that they submit high quality funding applications.<\/p><p>The desk has an important role in representing the Creative Europe programme on a national and European level and feeds into the European dialogue on EU AV policy.  The desk is a key interface between the Irish cultural and creative sectors and the European Commission.

A UK-Ireland audiovisual co-production is still covered by the Council of Europe's European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production.  That has remained intact and the relationship is preserved, although Brexit has created certain difficulties relating to the movement of goods between Ireland and the UK.

They do not need the same level of partnership that the culture side of the programme needs.  That being said, we have a new scheme under the new programme called European co-development.  For single projects, companies are obliged to work with a company in another EU country.  It would have been useful, particularly for the Irish language, if the UK was still involved, because Irish language companies tend to work with Scotland and Wales often, while English language companies have many contacts in the UK.  Nevertheless, on the audiovisual side, people are at the markets and work internationally.  It is not a major problem to work with other European countries.  There are slight complications relating to distribution.  Ireland has always been bundled in with the UK as a territory for distribution.  It is slightly more complicated for a European distributor to distribute a European film within Ireland and not have the UK attached.  That will evolve and change in time as people adjust to new business models because of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  The only other adverse effect that we have seen in the first year of the programme is in the television programming scheme, where organisations can apply for funding for up to 20% of the production budget of television and online projects.

I have two questions.  In 2018 or 2019, or possibly before that, the European Commission, through Creative Europe, provided a fund of &euro;120 million for a cultural and creative guarantee fund to be managed by the European Investment Fund on behalf of the Commission.  The expectation was that this would generate hundreds of millions of euro in lending to the creative and cultural sector.  I am not sure if a financial intermediary was ever approved in this State, but perhaps our guests could shed light on that and if there is a need for such a fund again or if there is one in place.  I would appreciate any comments they have on that.<\/p> <p>  The second question is a general one about Irish partners' performance in co-operation projects.  How have the past couple of years been for Irish partners in co-operation projects?  How have they performed in accessing Creative Europe funding?  What are the principal obstacles to arts and cultural organisations that either hope to apply for or apply for Creative Europe funding?  Are they networking costs and travel costs?  In the past, there would have been calls for research and development funding from the Government aimed at domestic artists and organisations.  Is there anything, therefore, the State can be doing to increase the draw down of EU funds for Irish partners?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#N00500","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1383,"content":"<p>I will take the question on the guarantee fund.  The guarantee fund was launched in 2016 for the cultural and creative sectors.  It proved to be very successful.  It was operated by the EIF and additional funding was provided on two different occasions.  In the end the final amount that was allocated to it was &euro;258 million.  It was expected that approximately &euro;2.5 billion would be leveraged through that fund.  It was a guarantee fund guaranteeing bank loans or loans from other financial institutions.  Unfortunately, although we had briefed the Irish banks on multiple occasions and we also had a briefing with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, there was a focus particularly on Brexit at that time and no Irish bank or financial intermediary participated.  However, there were a number of banks in Europe and some Irish projects, particularly on the audiovisual side, were supported through the French banks, with which we do a lot of business anyway.<\/p> <p>  Since the most recent programme ended in 2020, that financial instrument has moved into InvestEU and is no longer part of Creative Europe.  There are 14 different sectors covered within InvestEU and one is devoted to the cultural and creative sectors.  It is no longer in Creative Europe and we do not have a remit to promote it anymore.  However, next week at the Cannes Film Festival it is due to launch another instrument called Media Invest.  It is different from the guarantee fund of the latest programme, which was aimed at bank loans.  This will be about equity investment.  It will be to support SMEs to access equity investment by having a similar leveraging fund available.  We do not have the detail of that because it is due to be launched next week, but once it is launched we hope to promote it in Ireland and to deal with different agencies involved with equity investment, such as Enterprise Ireland and the Western Development Commission.  Of course, we also liaise with Screen Ireland and Screen Producers Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#N00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Eibhl&iacute;n N&iacute; Mhunghaile"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1384,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his question.  It is really the hundred million euro question.  This is the core of our work and it is great to be able to speak to that.  Under the past programmes, Ireland's participation has constantly been increasing, which has been great to see.  If we look at the latest programme across co-operation projects, which is the main funding strand, and support for European platforms for emerging artists and literary translation, 80 projects received funding, representing 78 Irish organisations.  This was a significant result and in cash terms it is approximately &euro;5.2 million.  The main profile for Ireland's participation for as long as I have been in the job has been as a partner.  When one talks about a lead and a partner, a lead is really an administrative lead but the partnership is considered an equal artistic partnership by the Commission.  It is important to emphasise that.  There has been a lot of alignment here nationally, and Ms Tunney can speak to this later, among funding agencies in terms of policy or strategic priorities that are aligning quite clearly with what Creative Europe wants to fund, so Ireland is very well positioned.<\/p> <p>  Regarding some of the main barriers, historically these are large-scale partnership projects that require match funding and that has always been a barrier.  My colleague, Ms O'Callaghan, from the Arts Council, can speak to Arts Council supports, but one of the key innovations of the new programme that is going to be significant is that the Commission has raised the amount that it will put into a project.  The maximum for the small scale, for example, would be 80%, so now an Irish organisation might only have to raise 20% of the budget.  That is significant.  Overall, European funding is bureaucratic, as many of the committee members probably have experience with either themselves or through their network of contacts.  It is a technical process.  Applications take a lot of work and a long time, and capacity is an issue.  That is one that we work to a lot in the Creative Europe desk.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, there will be organisations applying to take part in and deliver pan-European projects, but they are also delivering significant volumes of national work to their base here.  Capacity is an issue and we work a lot on that in the desk with our clients.  One of the things we always tell people is that if they want to take part in a European project as a small or micro arts, culture or heritage organisation, they need to start working it into their longer-term planning and talk to their board and their funders.  If somebody is going to make an application under the Creative Europe culture strand, it will probably take at least a year.  It involves long-term planning and assessing honestly one's own resources and seeing how they can be apportioned or allocated to a European project.  That is a lot of our work.  On the technical side of the process, that is what we are funded to do.  On an ongoing basis we will give a great deal of one-to-one support around the deadline and going through applications with people, but we also run technical workshops.<\/p> <p>  One of the things is that our geographical position makes it inherently more difficult to mount one of these projects.  We are not based in the centre of Europe.  We are three or four countries and a train journey away, so that is an issue.  We found during the Covid-19 crisis that networking and partner searching is happening virtually, which has been brilliant.<\/p><p> The other thing that enables organisations in the arts and culture sector to get funding is that we have quite a strong infrastructure of arts centres, venues and funded organisations.  In 2016, it was brilliant to see that the Arts Council piloted a Creative Europe co-funding award.  Within the Creative Europe programme and all the countries taking part, you find that a number of them have dedicated funds for organisations that achieve Creative Europe funding.  The Arts Council created that fund in 2016, not only to support organisations that have achieved the funding but also to act as an incentive to help organisations start to imagine these types of projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Katie Lowry","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1386,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to come here.  As Ms Lowry stated, in consultation with colleagues, we recognised in the Arts Council that the requirement to raise funding domestically was becoming an impediment, even at the outset, for organisations to even consider making applications.  In 2016 we introduced a co-fund which provided successful applications to the Creative Europe programme with co-funding for the activities that occurred in Ireland.  That has been successful to date and so far 25 applicants have been awarded nearly &euro;600,000 in that co-funding award.  That has realised total EU grants of just over &euro;1.7 million, with an Irish spend of just under &euro;1.2 million, and it has seen projects funded in Dublin, Galway, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford.  That has given the programme a momentum because from its introduction in 2016, its success has bred success and it has demonstrated to other would-be applicants that this was available and in a way it cut out one of those other barriers to making a project successful in Ireland.  We intend to continue with that because the evidence to date suggests it is working well and is breaking down one of those other barriers to engaging with the programme.  We will continue to deliver that.  It is a key part of the Arts Council's commitment to develop work internationally and to support international collaboration, which we would see within the EU and in the context of the UK as well, to refer to the earlier question.

I want to get the witnesses' wisdom and observations on a couple of things.  Video games were mentioned.  I refer to what we are trying to do to drive job creation and innovation in our regions.  We recently discovered the power of remote working, which was somewhat forced upon us, and we are now drawing conclusions as to the power it can have in the future.  If the witnesses were in a position to shape the Irish landscape for the promotion and development of video game creation outside our larger urban centres, how would they go about doing that or are we destined to have that happening in our urban centres?  Is there a creative ecosystem that only allows it to happen in larger urban centres?<\/p> <p>  Ms McGrane spoke about sustainable tourism and I am wondering where the crossover point where culture evolves into sustainable tourism is?  What is the nexus whereby we can promote sustainable tourism?  Again, I would argue for initiatives like Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  I was recently cycling around north Roscommon and south Leitrim, which have stunning landscapes that are not well promoted, and those areas do not avail of the opportunities available in tourism internationally.  If you look at what happened in Loop Head over the past ten years or so, a group down there has won numerous awards for its sustainable tourism offering.  How can this programme support the development of other such models around the country?  What sort of interaction, if any, happens between programme directors like our guests and our local authority arts officers throughout the country?<\/p> <p>  From the witnesses' engagement at EU level, is there a country or countries that are seen as the exemplars in how best to maximise the opportunities presenting to this programme.  If so, what are they doing that we are not doing?  If Ireland is not an exemplar, what support would the witnesses need, as individuals, to ensure that it can be an exemplar?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TOJ2022051100002#O00400","speaker":"1483"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1389,"content":"<p>I might take some of those questions, the first of which was on video games.  The video game sector presents an exciting opportunity for new audiovisual work to come out of Ireland.  We have quite a healthy and young video games industry.  Interestingly, much of it is located in the west of Ireland.  From Screen Ireland's point of view, the other witnesses will be aware that the Government has approved a new tax incentive for video games, similar to the film production tax incentive.  That is going through EU approval for the cultural test and hopefully that will be rolled out towards the end of the year.  We are positive about what the impacts of the tax incentive will be.  As the Deputy points to sustainable job creation, the video game sector is one that can do that.  In the last 18 months, Screen Ireland has rolled out a number of hubs.  One is in Galway and it is a film and TV talent hub and another is the animation hub for the animation sector.  Because the industry has been growing so much, we have rolled out three crew hubs in Limerick, Wicklow and Galway.  It is our intention to roll out a video games hub, the location of which is the subject of discussion.  This will act as a hub to train up the next generation of video gamers.  Many great things are happening in the video games world.<\/p> <p>  I might hand over to my colleagues to talk about sustainable tourism, although I could take about film tourism.

On foot of that, it was recognised that cultural heritage in Ireland and across Europe was an underdeveloped or under-recognised area of work and that there were innovative possibilities there for development.

Independent companies there have received support, some of them on more than one occasion.  Furthermore, a company in Ramelton, Donegal, has received support.  Because it is computer based, it is the kind of industry that could locate anywhere.  The companies tend to cluster together naturally given everyone needs peers in their work, but there are definitely possibilities.<\/p> <p>  Only &euro;6 million annually from the entire Creative Europe programme goes to video games.

My question relates to Screen Ireland in general, but there may be an opportunity to tie it in with the issue of Creative Europe funding as well.  It concerns the potential for funding small to medium-scale film and TV studios.  Our guests referred earlier to the innovation programme, transnational creations and audiovisual content creation.  From the fantastic brochure outlining the various projects in which Screen Ireland has been involved, it is clear much drama and television has been invested in.<\/p> <p>  I come from west Cork - the other committee members will roll their eyes to heaven because I talk about west Cork and what is going there at every opportunity I get - and some of the productions Screen Ireland has funded have been shot there.  That includes \"Sparrow\" and \"Float Like a Butterfly\", which was made by Carmel Winters from just west of Skibbereen and which is an amazing film.  Screen Ireland is involved in individual projects, but could that be extended such that it could get involved in, invest in and fund the setting-up of film and television studios?  There is a project in Skibbereen at the moment and it has blown my mind because I had not realised west Cork was so full of film and television expertise, from art directors and designers to producers.  I am not even referring to David Puttnam or Jeremy Irons; they do not even come into the equation.  The expertise also includes set-makers, carpenters and artists in general, who are everywhere in west Cork.  They have come together with the idea of creating a small to medium-sized television studio in Skibbereen that could take on large productions.  They have just been granted planning permission to convert a furniture-manufacturing unit into a TV studio, so the building is already there.  To get it up and running, however, they need funding for sound-proofing, lighting and the various other aspects that constitute a TV studio.<\/p> <p>  I am not sure whether my question fits within the parameters of Creative Europe, but I certainly think Screen Ireland should get involved in this.  It is predicted that the total cost will amount to about &euro;1.5 million for the conversion of this furniture-manufacturing unit into a studio that could take on large-scale productions from the likes of Netflix, Apple, Amazon and a range of streaming or non-streaming producers.

It is a film company in Cavan that is really innovative, energetic and dynamic and has big ideas.  There is that gap in the Border region.  To where does one go to get the moneys to get the physical infrastructure in place to nurture the talent and give the crews an opportunity to get up and running in that area?  As was stated, they probably all tend to cluster together because that offers peer support.  I ask our guests to comment on that.<\/p> <p>  On education, this may have been covered while I was absent from the meeting.  Is there any way for schools to be involved in the work being done on the ground in the context of a creative Europe?  How is that being nurtured?  How is the information being disseminated into schools and education?

It is imperative they comply with any such direction.<\/p> <p>  There are some limitations to parliamentary privilege for witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does.  Witnesses participating from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make changes against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts of Leinster House will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member partaking via MS Teams to confirm he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting.  If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contacting Covid-19.  I thank the witnesses for attending and ask Mr. O'Mahony to make his opening statement.  Deputy Carey will substitute for me for a couple of minutes as there is something I need to attend to.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#A00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":1451,"content":"<p>Deputy Joe Carey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1452,"content":"<p>We are pleased to appear before the committee as representatives of the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association, ICGVRA, and we thank the committee for its invitation.<\/p><p>Last October, a member of this committee commented that the initialism ICGVRA did not roll off the tongue.  We agree but it describes who we are, what we do and our role.  Our association was set up during 2021 and was officially launched in Kilkee, County Clare.  The establishment of our representative association was the result of many discussions between Irish Coast Guard volunteers over the preceding months.  During those discussions, we concluded that there was a profound lack of support for Irish Coast Guard volunteers who were in dispute with the management and that a volunteers representation body within the ICG structure was lacking.  We set about putting our association together to represent any and every volunteer in a situation of conflict or grievance but also to co-operate with management to establish a better working environment for the volunteers. <\/p><p> We launched our association publicly in Kilkee, County Clare.  Kilkee is the place where we Coast Guard volunteers lost one of our own in August 2016, which will be six years ago this coming August.  We remember Caitr&iacute;ona Lucas here today as we remember those who died in Rescue 116 at Black Rock, County Mayo, and in Rescue 112 many years before in the dunes in County Waterford.  Today, we will present our view on several issues that concern us.  <\/p><p> The first has regard to the Coast Guard code of conduct.  The Coast Guard code of conduct outlines the way that any complaint or interpersonal issue that may arise during training or on a search and rescue operation is to be resolved.  Unfortunately, in many cases, it is used against the volunteer, with many being threatened with disciplinary action or dismissal.  The process of dealing with volunteers&rsquo; complaints does not reflect the pathway described in the Coast Guard code.  It often results in despair and the destruction of great volunteers.  The Coast Guard code does not mention anywhere the circumstances in which a volunteer is entitled to any representation whatsoever other than that a fellow volunteer may accompany another at a disciplinary hearing or meeting, although only as a witness.<\/p><p> The second issue I will raise relates to the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, CUAG.  From the minutes of CUAG meetings going back as far as 2012 circulated by management, some alarming facts are evident regarding the interactions both between Irish Coast Guard management and CUAG and between CUAG and Coast Guard volunteers.  There are some serious issues with the way CUAG was formed to start with but, critically, CUAG has thereafter been controlled and managed by Irish Coast Guard management.  CUAG officers are elected at the annual officers in charge, OICs, conference so only OICs can nominate and elect members to CUAG.  The suggestion made to the committee in November 2021, when Irish Coast Guard management came before it, that CUAG members are elected by the volunteers is therefore untrue.  At that hearing, it was stated that CUAG can advocate on behalf of a volunteer.  The CUAG terms of reference do not allow a CUAG member to represent a volunteer in disciplinary matters, hence the formation of our association to fulfil this role. We understand that there are currently volunteers who are not OICs on CUAG but we have not seen any change in its operation and we do not know how these volunteers are selected. <\/p><p> We would like to discuss two of the many reports carried out over many years that have affected many Coast Guard volunteers: the Fisher report and the Mulvey report.  In summary, there are many concerns raised by volunteers on Irish Coast Guard management and the functioning of Irish Coast Guard structures.  We thank the Chairman, the committee and our own supporters and families, who have helped us get here today.  Several people, who I am not going to mention, have assisted us and they are very important to us.  We got a lot of assistance from the press in the early days, when nobody wanted to know who we were.  International maritime lawyer, Michael Kingston, assisted us in getting our association legally registered.  We thank him for that.  I will conclude by declaring that we will answer members' questions factually and honestly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1454,"content":"<p>The witnesses are very welcome to this hearing.

It happened as a result of a grievance Coast Guard management had with me.  It asked for a boat review of the Dunmore East Coast Guard unit.  That is how it all started.  It was called a Coast Guard boat review and there was no mention of a grievance or anything.  It later became what was clearly a witch-hunt and then an investigation.  Six or eight weeks into this boat review, the terminology used in emails sent to me began to include the word \"investigation\".<\/p> <p>  In my own circumstances, management came to ask me questions regarding the Dunmore East Coast Guard unit.  I answered these openly and honestly.  Management then asked if it could talk to my team members.  At the time, there were 22 members of the team in Dunmore East.  I said that it should of course feel free to ask any of my team whatever questions it wanted to ask.  It said the questions would be based on what I had already been asked.  At my hearing, held in the Ramada hotel in Waterford city, I was allowed to bring my deputy officer.  I could bring whoever I wished from my team and I chose my deputy officer.  My Deputy and I were clear that, if those questions were put to any of our team, they would answer in the same way we did, that is, openly and honestly.  However, we found out afterwards that team members could not express themselves when questioned.  Only yes-no answers were allowed.  If they were asked whether there were non-Coast Guard members on the Dunmore East Coast Guard boat, they could only answer \"Yes\" or \"No\".  As it transpired, we had the likes of Charlie Bird - whom I wish well if he is listening today - and other RT&Eacute; correspondents on the boat when they were making programmes about safety at sea.  We would get permission from our Coast Guard managers in this regard.  They were the only people.  From time to time, we also held wreath-laying ceremonies.  As the Senator will know, the south-east coast has seen tragedy after tragedy at Dunmore East since 2006.  Our unit was responsible for recovering most of those people.  We brought their families out for wreath-laying ceremonies, which were always okayed by management.  While I was able to explain that to management, when my team was asked whether people who were not Irish Coast Guard personnel had been on our boat, they had to answer \"Yes\".  That was how management came after me.  <\/p> <p>  At that time, I was a sitting member of CUAG having been elected onto it for a third time in 2018 but at no stage in my hearing was I told that I could rely on CUAG for backup or for help in my appeal process.  I was sent email after email from a company called Graphite, which was investigating me, but my investigation was through management only and I do not believe my voice was expressed to anybody for fair hearing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Griffin"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>All of the witnesses are senior members of the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association.

Whether that is legitimate or not, privacy and confidentiality then come into play in any dealings between Irish Coast Guard management and the volunteer concerned.  He or she is not allowed to share information with other team members.  The members of the team then become distant from each other.  The team can often split.  No local resolution is allowed anymore.  We have done this for many years.  We have almost 100 years of service between us and for many years we were involved in bringing teams together.  Under the current management, that is not encouraged now or even allowed.  Disputes are taken out of the local team and dealt with as grievance complaints or volunteers are being put on trial.

This is a nationwide communications system, and these radios are used by the fire service, local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the ambulance service.  The Irish Coast Guard helicopter crews use it as well, and the coast radio stations at Valentia, Dublin and Malin Head have it.  It is used to communicate with the helicopter crews and other emergency services.  Unfortunately, the volunteers were issued one set.  This set was unable to be used to communicate with other emergency services.  It did not have a function that would allow the dialling of the ambulance service or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Members of those organisations could be physically on-site with volunteers, but was not possible to make a communication call to them.  That is important from an information perspective regarding a casualty.<\/p> <p>  Those TETRA sets were then withdrawn and their function was eliminated from the volunteer crews.  Therefore, we could not then call the crew of a Coast Guard helicopter that was coming into a helicopter landing site with a patient, who could possibly be critically ill, to provide an update to our own people regarding what to do.  Yet management has that ability.  A great deal of money has been spent on the TETRA radio system for volunteer crews, but they are now on shelves in cupboards and not being used.  We are denied the function that management has available and that the members of all the other emergency, or blue light, services have.

Incidents are turned out to by volunteers only.  Since the foundation of the State, since we were the Irish Marine Emergency Service and progressed to the Irish Coast Guard in 2000, we were always the volunteers who turned out to incidents.<\/p><p> On the question the Senator asked about morale, when we stated to the committee in our opening statement that there is more than 100 years of experience here, any other organisation would embrace that 100 years and look for it to make the organisation a more professional organisation and would interact with us.<\/p><p> The Senator talked about us being perhaps just four disgruntled members.  From day one, we have gone to management time after time - some of them became very good friends of ours through the 23 years that we worked with them - and said what is being done is so unfair.  They have to listen to us.  Our concerns are for the volunteers and for those who are coming after us, be it our sons or daughters or people in our community who want to become Coast Guard volunteers, but they would not, or refused to, engage on our safety concerns.  It was almost as if they thought we were getting too big for our boots but we were getting very professional.  As life and the Coast Guard, as the fourth emergency service, progressed, we were that finding incident after incident was becoming high-tech and we were getting good at it but they did not want to take our concerns on board.<\/p><p> Morale is at an all-time low within the Coast Guard.  I would go as far as to say the Order of Malta, Civil Defence and other such organisations are finding it difficult to recruit volunteers.  I would say that applies to Scouting Ireland and all such organisations, but the Coast Guard and mountain rescue are the complete opposite because of the intensity of the work we do.  We have volunteers constantly wanting to join the Irish Coast Guard, the South Eastern Mountain Rescue Association, SEMRA, and mountain rescue, but not in its current form.  We are being told that.  As ex-officers constantly in our community, when the Coast Guard is back to what it used to be, we would love to come back on board.  Eleven of my members left when I was dismissed.  I would say more than 70% of Coast Guard units across the State at present are operating, or are limping along, on a little more than 50% of their volunteers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#C03400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Griffin","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1494,"content":"<p>I welcome the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association here.

It is important to point to the extensive experience within the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association and beyond.  That tells a tale and should not go unnoticed.<\/p> <p>  I will try to move it on a little bit.  The witnesses will have heard the exchange the last time.  What needs to change?  What has changed in the recent weeks and months since we had previous hearings?  Is it enough?  What more needs to change?  I will pick up on a previous point.  We will hear from the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, CUAG, in the next session.  I expect there have been some changes there.  The witnesses have pointed to some changes that have happened there in the recent past.  Are they enough?<\/p> <p>  It is significant that CUAG is an advisory group.  The Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association is a representative group.  Has the latter group had meetings with the Minister?  Is it recognised?  Is it established in that way?  What does the future look like?  Is there a need for CUAG to continue?  Will it take on an advisory role, along with the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association?  Will there be a blending of the two?  How does that configure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#E03300","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1540,"content":"<p>I will pass to Mr. Farr in a moment.

At that stage, we were probably trundling along from 2012 through to 2014 or 2015 with that code of conduct book.  It was then rehashed and rejigged and, at that stage, volunteers and officers in charge had very little input into it.

We should not have to go to an ombudsman but if we could ensure that our rights in the code of conduct were available to us, there would not be an issue.  However, we are not allowed.

We had Mr. Mulvey for one-and-a-half hours on a Tuesday night.  That was the total time for our mediation.  He told us that he would be back the following Tuesday night.  He never came back.  He said the weather was too bad or made some reference to the weather; there might have been a storm at the time.  We never saw Mr. Mulvey again so our mediation process was for one-and-a-half hours.  He spoke to the group of ten of us first, and the other six afterwards who also got one-and-a-half hours.  No, I do not call that mediation.  Mediation is a process that might take weeks or months.  So, to answer the question, no I am not happy, nor are any of the ten of us.  Essentially they were dismissed.  You could not be happy with one-and-a-half hours of mediation.  This is from a professional person who has done this all his life.  He referred to things in the Mulvey report, as it is called, but he did not speak to any members individually.  We were all in a room with a total stranger.  People are a bit apprehensive about speaking about stuff and might speak more freely on a one-to-one basis.  Instead of doing that he took reports from Graphite which they had done previously on one-to-one meetings with us.  He used those as the basis of his one-to-one meetings.  However, when we did those meetings with Graphite we were told that they were private and confidential.  Yet he got access to them.  We do not think that is right.  We actually think it is very wrong because those meetings were carried out on the basis that they were private and confidential.<\/p> <p>  So we are not at all happy.  He took a team and he split it in half.  Six people resigned over problems with management, a typical thing like the Cliffs of Moher and different issues.  Four of those people went back, two did not.  Sorry I put the cart before the horse there.  We were all sacked so they put together this internal team as they called it.  Four of those people who were sacked, went back.  They took back two members who had resigned two or three years previously.  There were 12 of us and they asked two more to come back and that made up the eight people.  Subsequently they asked a couple more of the ten to come back and they said no, they were not going back.  They took eight people of whom four qualified; two had retired so some of their certificates had expired.  They got rid of a group of ten people who could have continued the unit on all disciplines on the boat, searching and climbing, fully certified, and took on eight who cannot do climbing because there are not enough qualified people, and the boat is restricted.  All they can do is search.  Where is the logic behind that?  I can see where they are coming from.  If you read the report or any of the Facebook comments on the accident at the Cliffs of Moher yesterday, it said Rescue 115 attended along with Doolin Coast Guard.  It looks great on paper.  Doolin Coast Guard was there.  Brilliant, but if you look into it deeply, there were three volunteers who could not go over a fence to help a person, that is the reality.  They were there, definitely, but could they do anything?  No.  How does it make sense to take away ten people who could do all the tasks, and take on people who are very limited in what they can do?  Essentially the unit is not functioning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Bernard Lucas"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1651,"content":"<p>It will take five years for the newly constituted unit to have the same qualifications as the current team and to be available for full service.

I would remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Reluctantly, I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to partake from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member who is partaking via MS Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  <\/p> <p>  If attending the meeting in the committee room, you are asked to exercise personal hygiene to protect yourself and others and from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  I will now ask Mr. Murray to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#M00200","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1682,"content":"<p>I thank the chair and committee members for the invitation to attend the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and to assist it in its discussion of the Irish Coast Guard.  I am a fisherman and a farmer and I live in Cleggan, Connemara, County Galway.  I have been an unpaid volunteer with the Cleggan unit of the Irish Coast Guard for 30 years.  I have served as a volunteer officer in charge, OIC, of that unit since 2014.  The Cleggan unit is a dual-function unit, in that it is a search and drone unit.  The Cleggan unit is not a boat unit, nor does it have a cliff rescue team.  I lead a unit of 15 volunteers who respond 24-7 to emergency calls in the north Connemara area.  From 2022 to date, we have been tasked to 18 incidents.  In 2021, our team responded to 43 incidents in total.  This highlights the willingness and commitment of Coast Guard volunteers everywhere who give up their time without hesitation to help others.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied today by CUAG members: Mr. Kieran Gallagher, Ballyglass Coast Guard; Ms Megan Grindrod, Doolin Coast Guard; Mr. Colin Murray, Howth Coast Guard; and Mr. Brendan Cahill, Toe Head Coast Guard.  I have been a member of CUAG since 2016 and co-ordinator since 2019.  In a typical year, CUAG meets quarterly and more frequently if there are agenda items that require a more intensive focus.  CUAG is usually consulted by IRCG management when they are preparing standard operational procedures, SOPs, developing operational policy and when headquarters are preparing specifications for equipment and uniforms.<\/p> <p>  CUAG is a forum that enables the views of Coast Guard members from the 44 teams across the country to be conveyed to IRCG management and to shape policies and procedures where they impact on operational volunteer units in their roles.  CUAG can assist OICs and volunteers in dealing with a wide variety of queries which arise in volunteer units.  CUAG&rsquo;s terms of reference have been reviewed and amended as part of the possible recommendation in the Mulvey report.  CUAG engaged with management on assessing CUAGs role in providing a representative role in matters relating to serving volunteers, in particular, a representative role in relation to discipline, grievance and complaints and termination of membership.<\/p> <p>  The new terms of reference reflect the representative roles in these matters.  CUAG has now got independent HR supports when required for volunteers, structures for secretariat support for CUAG and training in peer support for HR issues.  Training is provided for newly elected members of CUAG.<\/p> <p>  Again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to contribute the volunteer and CUAG perspective to its examination of the IRCG.  I am happy to answer any questions the committee members may wish to ask.  In the event that I am unable to answer a specific question, I will endeavour to obtain the information and provide a written answer to the committee as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1683,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murray.

I think everybody will be happier with their content.  Through CUAG, we have independent HR representation for volunteers in grievance issues where we feel it is needed for them.  As an example, if a disciplinary procedure is started against a volunteer or an OIC, we can now get independent HR assistance to that person, which will be in a position to advise professionally.  We in CUAG, obviously, are not HR consultants, so we needed that firm to be available to help and guide these people and to go through everything with them from a HR perspective.  That is what was sought and it is what we have got, and we are happy that has happened as part of the process.<\/p> <p>  In the case of minor complaints, if we call them that, we would like a designated grievance contact to be set up.  This would involve an unofficial, friendly chat with the two people involved, whether two volunteers or an OIC and a volunteer, whom we could get in from the Coast Guard cadre.  They could be people with or without experience or volunteers; it does not matter.  We could ask whoever wished to be in that role to sit down with the people involved, outside of their team.  They could come from different areas of the Coast Guard, from wherever we can get them, and they could sit down, chat and try to resolve issues before they get too far.  Sometimes, nipping issues in the bud and not letting them fester can help a great deal in any HR matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#N00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1696,"content":"<p>Are these new procedures?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#N00600","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1697,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#N00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Murray"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":1698,"content":"<p>Was Mr. Murray involved in developing them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTJ2022051100002#N00800","speaker":"1507"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":1699,"content":"<p>Yes.

What I believed to have been a localised problem appeared to be way more widespread.  The witnesses have a difficult job in trying to represent all that and gather it together.  It was not even a homogenous position in Clare.  There were very different views and opinions, so the witnesses have a very difficult job.  We would love to hear that relations between the hierarchy and the volunteers have improved.  It seemed to me that day, and we had to ask them to come here, that they were remote from us and they felt they were remote from their units.

Just for his information, the witnesses stated that there were 100 members from widespread coastal communities, from Mayo down around the west coast and back around the east coast.  They would have a lot more members who would also put their heads above the parapet but they are fearful to do that because they are subjected to harassment and are subjected to bullying and different issues.  This is why they will not come forward.  We have heard that at different levels.  This is what people are saying to me.<\/p> <p>  I put it to Mr. Murray, as a person who is on this advisory committee, that I believe it is the wrong term.  It is not a representative group.  This is what the other group is trying to do: to actually represent people.  It is ironic that the terms and conditions changed in the weekend before this hearing.  That change is welcome but, for me, the organisation is constituted in the wrong way.  It is not at arm's length from management.  This is what volunteers are saying to me.  I welcome the fact that it is being reconstituted, that the organisation will have access to a HR consultant and that there is a secretariat available.  How many years has it taken to bring it to that particular point?  To get on CUAG, who does one need to be?  Is there a vote?  There are some ordinary volunteers on its now as well, but how did they end up on it?
