My colleagues Mr. Cullen and Mr. Sheridan are from our income tax and indirect tax units, respectively.<\/p> <p>  We are meeting at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and economic volatility.  As well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created a large supply side shock that has shaken the global economy, with European economies at the epicentre.  Given Russia's outsized role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen sharply in recent months.  As Ireland is a global price taker, this has fed through to higher energy prices for businesses and households.<\/p> <p>  It is important we give some context to the current inflationary environment.  The emergence of inflationary pressures contrasts markedly with the relatively low inflation we experienced for the guts of the past decade.  In Ireland, inflation averaged at 0.5% between 2010 and 2019 and at 1.5% in the euro area.  Initially, the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this low inflation environment.  As the decline in demand in 2020 outstripped the fall in supply, Ireland's inflation turned negative, reaching something like -0.5%.<\/p> <p>  While consumer price inflation remained subdued in Ireland in the first quarter of last year, the annual rate of inflation picked up sharply thereafter, with both domestic and global factors behind the increase.  These included a recovery in energy prices from their lows in 2020 - we call these base effects - as well as global supply chain disruptions, supply side bottlenecks and pent-up demand.  To address this, budget 2022 in October contained an income tax package to the value of &euro;520 million.  This involved increases in the standard rate band and key personal tax credits.  On the expenditure side, a social welfare package worth approximately &euro;560 million was introduced, as were a range of other measures, including health and childcare supports, aimed at mitigating the cost of living.  At the time of budget 2022, inflationary pressures were expected to ease over the course of the winter and throughout this year.  However, higher than anticipated energy prices throughout last winter resulted in higher than expected inflation in the winter and into early spring.<\/p> <p>  The war in Ukraine has served to exacerbate inflationary pressures further.  Inflation stood at 7.25% in April, which was the highest rate since the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, series began in 1997.  This is a trend we are seeing in all advanced economies.  In the euro area, inflation reached 7.5% in April.  Today, the US reported that its inflation rate had reduced to 8.3% in April from 8.5% in March.  The rates in the UK have been similar.<\/p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices are expected to continue feeding into higher inflation over the coming months.  As set out in the stability programme update, SPU, in late April and based on market prices at the time of the forecast, inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, peaking in the second quarter of this year and averaging at approximately 6.25% for the year as a whole.  Pass-through price effects are also expected in other sectors such as food through higher prices for energy and fertilisers - the latter is a by-product of higher energy prices itself - and consumer goods and services, also through higher energy prices and transport costs, with core inflation of approximately 4% projected for the year.  A significant easing is anticipated next year, with the headline rate projected to be approximately 3% for 2023 as a whole.  In fact, energy prices, while still expected to stay high, are expected to ease next year.<\/p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices will erode the real incomes of households while also denting the margins of firms.  This, alongside heightened uncertainty, will dampen consumer spending and private sector investment this year.  In this manner, inflation will act as a headwind against output growth.  As a result, we have revised downwards our forecast for modified domestic demand growth &ndash; our main indicator of economic activity &ndash; by approximately two and a quarter percentage points this year, with growth of 4.25% being forecast.<\/p> <p>  These projections were produced against a backdrop of exceptional uncertainty.  As such, risks to the forecast are considerable and firmly tilted to the down side.  In light of this, we also published a scenario analysis in the SPU in which wholesale oil and gas prices returned to their early March levels &ndash; indeed, slightly higher &ndash; and remained elevated relative to the baseline throughout this year.  Gas prices in this scenario are 75% above the baseline projection and oil prices are approximately 50% higher.  In this scenario, inflation would be two percentage points higher this year at 8.25% &ndash; peaking at 9.25% in the third quarter &ndash; and one and a quarter percentage points higher next year at 4.25%.  Of course, the energy price shock would not only affect inflation and would also have broader macroeconomic implications.  Output in the domestic economy would be approximately 2% lower over the medium term and the budget surplus of in or around &euro;1.2 billion for next year would be wiped out.<\/p> <p>  I will outline the Government's more recent response to increases in energy prices from a taxation perspective, and my colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will speak about expenditure measures.  In early March, the Government approved a VAT-inclusive reduction in excise duty of 20 cent per litre on petrol, 15 cent per litre on diesel and 2 cent per litre on marked gas oil, MGO, amounting to &euro;320 million.  Further measures were announced in mid-April, including a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas to 9% from 1 May until the end of October, which should result in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas bills and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  The cost of this measure is estimated at &euro;46 million.  There was also a further VAT-inclusive reduction of 3 cent per litre on MGO from 1 May and an extension of the reduction in excise duties on MGO, auto diesel and petrol to mid-October, with a combined cost just shy of &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>  Overall, including the expenditure measures that colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will shortly outline, cost-of-living measures announced since the budget amount to just over &euro;1 billion on top of the roughly &euro;1.1 billion in measures announced in budget 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss the measures introduced since budget 2022.  Budget 2022 set out an expenditure allocation of &euro;87.6 billion for investment in public services.  This allocation was made in line with the medium-term expenditure strategy, which sets out core expenditure growth of approximately 5% on average over the period to 2025.  A &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures was announced to support citizens across a range of sectors with cost-of-living pressures.  Some of the headline measures were increases in social protection payments, including weekly working age and pension payments, the living alone allowance, qualified child increase and fuel allowance; health affordability measures; funding for social and affordable housing; and enhanced student and childcare supports.<\/p> <p>  Analysis was undertaken using the ESRI's simulation welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, tax and benefit model to illustrate the impact of the budget.  The combination of tax and expenditure measures was progressive in nature, with households in the lowest income deciles seeing the strongest gains.<\/p> <p>  The economic and social context has changed considerably since the announcement of budget 2022 in October.  The emergence of this new set of challenges, including rising energy prices and the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine, has resulted in a number of budgetary developments.  Since December 2021, in the region of &euro;560 million in additional expenditure measures has been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs.  A number of these measures build on supports put in place in budget 2022.<\/p> <p>  I will set out a summary of the main measures.  An energy credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs.  This will benefit more than 2 million households at an Exchequer expenditure cost of just under &euro;380 million.  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in fuel allowance payments introduced in the budget, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit more than 370,000 households.  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the working family payment.  The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the drugs payment scheme was also introduced.  This will reduce medicine and drug costs for more than 70,000 recipients.  A temporary 20% reduction in public service obligation, PSO, public transport fares until the end of 2022 was introduced to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.  The estimated cost of this is &euro;54 million.  The maximum annual school transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year.<\/p><p>A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licensed heavy goods vehicles for a period of eight weeks.  This scheme reflects the vital role hauliers play in the supply chain.  The estimated cost is &euro;18 million.<\/p><p> Turning to the impact of construction inflation on public works projects, a number of changes were introduced in January to address price volatility.  These changes were made to contracting arrangements for new contracts to ameliorate challenges arising from inflationary pressures deriving from the pandemic.  Based on extensive feedback from Departments and owing to further constraints on supply chains and increased fuel and energy prices arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, yesterday announced the introduction of an inflation co-operation framework for those parties engaged under public works contracts.  This seeks to address the impacts of the most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption.<\/p><p> The Revised Estimates 2022 set out an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.6 billion.  This is inclusive of an unallocated contingency reserve of &euro;3.9 billion.  At this stage, approximately &euro;1.5 billion of the reserve has been committed, taking into account the increased Covid-related supports introduced in response to the December wave of the virus, and additional funding required for the cost-of-living measures I have outlined.  Furthermore, there will also be calls on the contingency reserve in the coming months in the context of any additional Covid-related expenditure, in particular as we enter the winter period, and for the provision of humanitarian supports to refugees arriving from Ukraine.  A Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29 - Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, was brought before the D&aacute;il in March.  Further Supplementary Estimates may be required later this year to provide for the measures I have set out.<\/p><p> The series of recently introduced measures to support households with cost of living pressures comes at a time of significant additional expenditure to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  The public finances are in a stronger position than this time last year, with Covid-19 related supports being unwound and tax revenue increasing.  However, risks to the fiscal position remain.  Borrowing since the beginning of the pandemic has increased, with gross general government debt of &euro;234 billion forecast for 2022 compared with &euro;204 billion at the end of 2019.  In this context, Government has sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation.  I thank members for this opportunity to speak with the committee.

I have two questions.  They relate to a couple of pieces I was reading about France.  In the context of the offsets by the Government, my layman's interpretation is that if you throw money at an economy during an inflationary period in terms of wages and things like that, it just helps to drive up the cost of living if the relevant measures are not targeted.  I advise our guests the cost of living is significantly impacting on constituents of mine, as it is on those of all my colleagues.  I read an interesting article about France.  The country was in election mode, but that does not matter.  The article stated: \"A decision last year to limit the amount by which France&rsquo;s largely state-owned energy companies could raise prices has benefited consumers and taken some of the inflationary pressure off industries that depend on gas and electricity.\"  The article also points to the fact that the electricity component of inflation in France has risen by 4% in the past 12 months but by an average of more than 27% in the eurozone generally.  France obviously took a measure there.  It could not ban an increase in energy prices by the energy suppliers but it did bring in a regulation that restricted the amount by which the suppliers could raise their prices.  My first question relates to whether those options open to Ministers here.  The officials may come back and say that France has had other problems, with other costs of living skyrocketing too.<\/p> <p>  Another piece I read recently also relates to France.  Macron has won the election and must deliver on some promises.  I am interested in the following concept though.  He is looking at trying to cap the prices of say, the top 120 essential items that we would get in our supermarkets or that families need.  In other words, this would cover the staples.  I would like to hear the officials reactions to those two issues.  I have no other questions after that.  I am happy to just get feedback on those two pieces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#C00300","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I do not know who wants to come in there.

The approach taken by Government was to introduce the energy credit to offset part of the increase in the electricity bills and then to use the fuel allowance as a means of targeting the additional funding at the most vulnerable sections of society and possibly the sections of society that are seeing higher levels of inflation because more of their income is being spent on the items the Deputy highlighted.  That is the logic behind the approach, namely, to provide the broad-based support through the energy credit and then the targeted support through the fuel allowance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We do not know this but maybe France does not have an energy regulator so that is out of the hands of Government here in this sense, even though most of the energy companies in France are state-owned.<\/p> <p>  The second piece was about being able to look at the top 120 most important staple retail purchases.

As far as I know, the rate of inflation in France was something of the order of 5.4% in April.  I guess we are getting desensitised because in Ireland in April it was 7.3%, so it is comparatively lower.  If you look at Irish inflation though, energy prices most recently, I think in April, had gone up year on year by something of the order of 44%.  It only about 8% or 9% of the overall basket but that sort of increase probably accounted for about half of the inflationary increase or there or thereabouts.  Thereafter, we are still seeing some price increases on the goods side.  Essentially, for the past decade, goods prices year on year were generally negative, for many reasons.  There was low-cost production in the far east and benefits from global supply chains kept prices low.  That has slightly reversed.  The pandemic has given rise to higher goods prices in Ireland and of course food is an issue.  However, we are not yet in the space where some goods and some foods are the subject of very strong rates of inflation.<\/p><p>On the basis of recent data, the price of energy is still the main driver of inflation.  Today's data are interesting and show that US inflation was 8.3% in the month of April, but that core inflation, stripping out energy prices - energy actually fell by 6% in the US in April - was 6.2%.  While the Deputy's question was about France, price increases in the US appear to be much more broadly based than in Ireland.  In Ireland and in some other European countries, it has been very much concentrated on energy to date.<\/p><p> There will be some exceptions in the context of some products in the basket, but it is not yet at the stage where it is being passed through.  We are expecting that to happen.  I stated earlier that we expect to see the effects passed through.  Obviously, food is one to watch.  While there might be exceptions on a product-by-product basis, on aggregate, food price inflation is not accelerating very strongly.  At this point, it is still relatively low and, interestingly, still lower than the euro area average.  Of course, we have seen extraordinarily high increases in fertiliser prices.  One fifth of our fertiliser comes from Russia.  It is one of the things in respect of which prices have accelerated quite a bit.  Wheat prices and general energy prices, particularly that of gas, will have an impact on products.  It will take a bit of time.  We might see it later in the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#C00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor is right.  It would be interesting to drill down into this.  An Indian friend of mine is one of the hardest-working people I have ever come across.  He has worked really hard.  He opened an Indian restaurant in Deputy Boyd Barrett's area between Monkstown and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He opened a second restaurant in Sandyford just before the Covid pandemic.  He has managed to keep them both going.  The man in question told me that a 15 kg tin of tomatoes was &euro;9 before Christmas and now costs &euro;18.  A tray of fresh chicken from his supplier used to cost &euro;43 or &euro;44 but he got it discounted to &euro;38 because he was a regular purchaser.  It now costs &euro;83 or &euro;84, discounted to &euro;78.  He has also been affected by the cost of petrol and diesel.  This is because he does a lot of deliveries for people who order takeaways.<\/p> <p>  I asked him if he was planning on increasing his prices.  He told me he was waiting until September.  Indian food is hot food and people tend not to come out to the restaurants so much at this time of year.  It is more of a winter kind of thing in colder weather.  Last week, I walked up Pembroke Road and looked at the menu in FX Buckley's.  I noticed that an 8 oz fillet steak costs &euro;42 and that a 10 oz one costs &euro;46.  FX Buckley is a good butcher, and it has a number of high-end restaurants for those who can afford to pay the prices.  Those are colossal prices.  My Indian friend had not passed on the cost to the consumer.  If he does in September, if others are also holding back, it will be pretty substantial.<\/p> <p>  The figures I have provided are not made up; they are real figures.  I was very much taken aback by what I discovered.  I do not expect feedback, I am just highlighting this as something to keep an eye on.  I am surprised at what Mr. O'Connor said to the effect that most of our inflation relates to energy.  It is very noticeable that the price of a cup of coffee and the other bits and pieces people buy all seem to be increasing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor wish to come back on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I do not disagree that certain products are probably the subject of high rates of inflation.  Regarding the aggregate for food, I am just looking at the March data.  In March, inflation stood at 6.9%.  Food price inflation contributed about one percentage point in total to that.  Energy contributed approximately four percentage points which brings it up to five percentage points between food and energy.  Obviously, goods and services make up the extra two percentage points to make 6.9%.  That is the average.  Obviously in every month there will be some items in any given basket with very strong rates of inflation, for instance the ones the Deputy has mentioned.  There will be some that will experience decreases.  On aggregate, for food and non-energy staples we are not yet experiencing very high rates of inflation.  I certainly would expect to see food prices rising over time, particularly given that the price of wheat has increased by 44% and with very high rates of inflation for things like fertiliser, which has increased by 75%.  In fairness, we have relatively strong projections for core inflation, non-energy inflation, of about 4% this year anyway.  That would probably tally with what the Deputy is saying.

The times we are facing are extremely unusual.  Deputy Lahart gave examples of his hard-working and nice friend who is struggling with the ever-increasing costs of the goods he supplies to his customers.  I have been a small shopkeeper for over 30 years.  Particular goods we have in a shop are called lines.  One of the biggest problems we now have with an awful lot of lines in a shop is not the cost of them, which is outside our control, but the actual supply of those lines.  It is the most random things.  For example, it can be a type of fruit, tinned food or anything.  It is the most unusual thing that can happen all of a sudden and it can go on for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months in every shop.  For instance, it could be lemons and there would not be a lemon to be got in any shop because they will only last for so long.  If the supply has stopped, everyone in a particular locality has no lemons and that can go on for weeks or months.  That has been happening with many hundreds of lines.  That is a problem we seem to be having.  I am afraid it will be beyond the reach of everybody to try and sort that.  It seems to be getting worse.<\/p> <p>  I wish to speak about public contracts.

My interest is obviously in the provision and delivery of the major public works that we want to do, such as our school building programme, road building programme and hospital extensions works.<\/p> <p>  For some time, I have been shouting about and looking for something to help contractors with inflation.  I welcome the inflation co-operation framework that was announced yesterday.  My question for the guests is whether they really think this will be enough.  In other words, will we still be able to get contractors to sign a contract with local authorities or the housing department to build so many houses at such a cost?  Will people take on the building of a bypass or a new section of road and agree to tie themselves into contract prices?  Will the assurance and what we might call the comfort zone which was provided yesterday be enough to ensure that the State will continue delivering on the programme that we are committed to delivering?<\/p> <p>  For instance, regarding access into County Kerry, we obviously want to see the Macroom bypass finished.  We want to see Listowel bypass, which has been started, finished.  We want to see the bypass coming down from Adare started.  Those are concerns I have.  The same applies to hospital works and school building programmes.  Many schools are on a programme for refurbishment and some are awaiting an entirely new school.<\/p><p>Some of those are in County Kerry and throughout the rest of the country.  When I am talking about Kerry, I am obviously talking about the rest of the country as well, because everybody has these concerns.  Do our guests think the measures put in place are enough to ensure we will continue delivering the works we have promised?  That is the first issue.<\/p><p> The second issue is our energy security, on which I have spoken and campaigned for a long period of time.  I was extremely disappointed that the provision of a liquefied natural gas facility was abandoned in the programme for Government.  I was obviously very disappointed with the Green Party, but I was hoping Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would have insisted on it staying in the programme for Government but they did not.  They all abandoned it.  How do our guests think the lack of energy security in Ireland will hinder and upset the ever-increasing cost of our electricity?<\/p><p> In recent days, I was contacted by people from a middling-sized town.  They run a chipper.  It is not McDonald's or Burger King.  It is just a chipper run by two family members.  They are very efficient and hardworking people.  They told me that their monthly ESB bill is &euro;10,000 every two months, that is &euro;5,000 a month.  They said that this is unsustainable.  They cannot put up the price of a carton of chips or a burger to cover this cost.  They have to be mindful of their pricing structure to ensure their customers can afford to go to them.  They have been in business for many years and they are seriously considering throwing in the towel.<\/p><p> Due to the fact that we will be so reliant in the future on England and France, and we are dropping the ball as a Government in ensuring we have gas or energy supplies ourselves, we are letting down those types of hard-working people and, indeed, young couples and householders who have endured enormous price hikes.  All we are being told is that it will continue.  That is unsustainable.  I would like to hear our guests' opinion on the Government taxing the life out of them, doing very little to help them, and at the same time saying it will try to give them back a bit of money by taking a couple of hundred euro off their ESB bills to keep them quiet.  The people are not falling for that.<\/p><p> We saw the rejection of what happened in the North when Green Party policies were thrown out the window.  That might be an eye-opener to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in the South as to what will happen here if people do not realise that the big issue today is mom's purse.  While we have great financial witnesses here today, they will know exactly what I mean by mom's purse.  If mom's purse is not right on a Friday evening, everything will be wrong in the world of finance after that.  Saturday, Sunday and Monday will get off to a very bad start if mom's purse is not right on Friday evening.  I was brought up to believe that.  If that purse is not able to pay the bills, run the show, and have a couple of pounds for a rainy day, everything will be in disarray and chaos as far as I am concerned.<\/p><p> The last issue I raise is farming.  It comes back to the most basic need of all, which is feed.  In order to have feed, we must have fertiliser.  I thought I would not live to see the day when bags of fertiliser would cost &euro;50 or &euro;55, a price which continues to go up.  One would nearly want to take the fertiliser out with a spoon in case one would waste any bit of it because it is so valuable.  It is crazy.  That model is unsustainable.  Some parties have said that they want to reduce the national herd.  This will make it very easy for them because people will not be able to keep the animals over the winter.  If they cannot keep animals over the winter and if we do not have a supply of beef coming into the trade, we will have food shortages because it will not be viable for farmers to stay in business and supply milk, beef, or lamb.<\/p><p> We have seen what happened in the pig industry.  It is unsustainable for pigs to be sold at a loss of up to &euro;30 and &euro;35 per pig.  Many people might not think about that.  Our hardworking piggeries that have survived different calamities over the years will be forced to closed in the coming months.  The package that was delivered was a sop.  It meant nothing in real financial terms.  I could provide figures in which it equated to 35 cent per pig to certain piggeries that supply an awful lot of pigs in the trade and whose losses are enormous.<\/p><p> We are facing very serious problems.  At the same time, we heard the Minister for Finance last week, and I have heard him in other public outings, say that the moneys coming into the Exchequer are very large.  While that might be happening, mom's purse is in serious difficulty and jeopardy at present.  I want to know what more we can do about it.  The idea that this scheme and that scheme will be made available is akin to chasing our tail.  What we have to do is try to bring down the massive increase in the cost of living that the people endure.  Today, for example, there was a motion before the D&aacute;il on wage increases.  I would love for people to have larger wages but we have to be mindful of the employers who are trying to pay those wages and find it very difficult to run their businesses.  Again, it is a case of the dog chasing the tail.  If we could arrest the massive increase in the cost of living, everything might start to stabilise.  I am sorry if I have gone on too long.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#D00500","speaker":"1487","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>The Deputy is just a little over time.

The changes the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced yesterday were the second set of changes announced this year.  On 7 January, in order to address the inflationary pressures we saw through the latter part of 2021, changes were introduced that applied to new contracts moving forward.  Under the contracts for public works that were in place prior to 7 January, there were stringent requirements in the cost of recovery during the fixed-price period.  Very high levels of inflation were required before a contractor could recover costs.<\/p> <p>  In recognition of the fact that we were in a period of high price volatility, changes were introduced in January that applied to new contracts.  Since then, with the war in Ukraine, the situation has deteriorated.  Some issues were highlighted and a number of contracting authorities and Departments raised these with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They included difficulties with existing contracts and issues as a result of the high increases in fuel costs, which were impacting on contracts for roads that require a large amount of machinery.  Bitumen was also an issue there.  Following this engagement, the Minister decided to make further changes.  These changes addressed contracts that were already in place in January.<\/p> <p>  At the time of the January changes, it was anticipated that we might see a moderation in inflation and that contracts which were already in place would be able to manage within the existing contractual arrangements.<\/p><p>The changes introduced yesterday now allow for retrospective recovery of price increases on materials with respect to payments made since 1 January for projects delivered under the old forms of contract dated prior to 7 January 2022.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at the point that they submitted their tender.  This applies until the completion of the project.  There is also retrospective recovery of price increases associated with energy and fuel with respect to payments since 1 January for projects being delivered under forms of contracts dated prior to 7 January.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at a defined date.  This will also apply until the completion of the project.<\/p><p> The forms of contract dated from 7 January already contain measures to recover inflation on materials over defined thresholds.  However, recovery of energy and fuel prices will now also be permitted as part of the measures introduced by the Minister yesterday.<\/p><p> Bearing in mind the supply chain disruption which contractors are facing, relief is also being provided in the form of an extension of the date for completion for the contract where there is disruption to the supply of materials linked to the war or to the pandemic for all public works contracts.  The measures set out by the Minister represent a balanced and proportionate response that looks to protect the delivery of the national development plan in a manner that also protects the Exchequer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I will make a very brief point.  Deputy Healy-Rae made reference to mom&rsquo;s purse.  He is speaking there to inflation and to the cost of living in a general sense, and I like the way he has put it.  We have had big increases in the Irish economy in gas and oil prices and we know why that happened.  These were obviously rising last year as well.  There were very strange things going on in gas markets in the world.  Gas is usually bought in a therm - do not ask me to explain what a therm is or what it looks like - and, generally speaking, it costs about 50 British pence for a therm.  It has been like that for a very long time where it may be 40 cent in the summer, where one is not using a great deal of gas, and 60 cent, perhaps, in the winter.  It increased considerably last year and breached the &pound;1 mark and was &pound;4 at one stage during the early days of the war.  These are price levels we have never seen in natural gas and there has obviously been a big oil price shock.  The cost of fertiliser is up approximately 150%, and this is also a by-product of natural gas.  Wheat, corn, soya beans, cooking and sunflower oil, one can name any product, and they have all increased greatly in price.  These are all things we import.<\/p> <p>  Earlier on we spoke somewhat about food prices and capping such staples.  We domestically produce some of these, such as cooked chickens or unprocessed foods, but we import many of these.  Essentially, income in Ireland is going to producers of fossil fuels around the world and the economy as a whole is poorer.<\/p> <p>  There is also then this debate or judgement, and one is getting into the core of policy here which I will not really comment on, about who takes that burden, be they households, firms or the Government.  Previously and certainly in the 1970s, and I have followed much of the discussion that has gone on recently about things like stagflation, which is where there is high inflation and low growth, the view at the time was that governments should borrow a great deal of money, run massive deficits and try to protect the full economy from the oil price shock as it was at the time, and from OPEC essentially.  Growth rates collapsed afterwards and unemployment completely skyrocketed.<\/p> <p>  The judgement that is being made now is that the Government will bear some of the cost and try to do this in a targeted manner.  That then becomes a decision, judgement or analysis as to whether that is enough, but much of the analysis, which I believe Mr. Kinnane mentioned in his opening statement, has shown that most of the gains have been to lower income households, which is what I think one probably tries to do when one targets these measures.  At least the gains from those are going to the types of households that one wants to target these measures at.  The higher income households, obviously, have a great deal of savings from the pandemic, and the analysis shows that things like the types of subsidies and allowances Mr. Kinnane spoke about are going to the lower income groups.  That is probably as much as I can say without going into policy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":30,"content":"<p>Perhaps following on from that point, Mr. O&rsquo;Connor put it well there when he said that the rising cost of energy is going into the pocket of energy providers.  This very accurately describes what is going on.  Somebody is benefiting from these price rises and it is the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers.  I wonder if any consideration has been given or has there been any discussion at all - I appreciate Mr O&rsquo;Connor cannot veer too much into policy as this is the area for politicians, and so on - about trying to control the cost of these things essentially by levying, either at a national, European or international level, the profits of those who are doing well ?  There is much international co-ordination going on these days, with unprecedented unity in the European Union when it comes to sanctions.  Is there any thought on co-ordination when it comes to controlling the price or the profits, or both, of the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers?Might that be a way to address the problem rather than chasing the price increases by giving money to people but, essentially, that is just public money going to those fossil fuel or energy companies?<\/p><p>I noted the discussion earlier on about what legislative powers are available to the Government.  I take the point that the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might not necessarily be familiar with that.  To address the point raised by Deputy Lahart and to familiarise people with it, the power exists to control the price of goods in, I believe, sections 60 and 61 of the Consumer Protection Act, where in situations of emergency the Government is allowed to control maximum and unit prices of goods and services.  Legislative power is there to do that and I wonder if any consideration has been given to doing that in the discussions as to how we might deal with these things, because it is worth saying the profits of energy companies have gone up considerably.<\/p><p>I will also be interested in hearing some comment because the profits of these energy companies went up long before the war in Ukraine and so have the prices.  To my mind, Ukraine is obviously having an impact, but there were also increases in energy and fuel prices before the war in Ukraine.  I would like to hear our guests comment on that and on why that was happening.  The website <i>bonkers.ie<\/i>has in recent days done some work in this area and estimated that energy prices in Ireland are something like 25% higher than the average in Europe and are among the highest prices in Europe.<\/p><p>Four other countries in Europe have energy prices in the same high range as us.  Why are we at the higher end?  Twenty years ago, we had some of the lowest energy prices in Europe, before the deregulation and privatisation of ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and so on but we now have some of the highest energy prices.  Will the witnesses comment on that?<\/p><p> There is a narrative that, given the impact of Ukraine, fossil fuel supply and the cost of fossil fuels, we need to develop more renewable energy.  We need to do that anyway for climate reasons.  Is it correct to say that even if we develop much renewable energy, it will have no impact whatsoever on the market price or even on the security of supply?  We have much more wind energy in this country than we used to, but it has not coincided with a reduction in electricity prices, even though we produce far more wind energy than we used to.  It has coincided with an increase in energy prices because, no matter how much energy is produced, the international market sets the price.  Energy production could be 100% renewable and it would not make any difference to the cost of electricity unless we publicly owned and controlled it and the prices.  Is that correct?  At the moment, all those prices are set by the market.<\/p><p> In their opening statement on the cost of living, the witnesses did not make much reference to the cost of housing and rent and what we will do about that.  Will they comment on that?  I am of the view that we need to bring in rent controls and to have maximum price ceilings on what can be charged, because every other measure seems to have failed.  I do not believe there is any evidence that ramping up supply will lead to a reduction in rents or house prices, as the Government is saying.  I do not know of any evidence in the history of this State of rents or house prices falling just because supply happened to be increasing.  The opposite happened in the Celtic tiger period.  Does the Department of Finance think, if we ramp up supply, that rents and house prices will fall at some point?  If that is the thinking, where is the evidence for believing that might be the case?  I do not see how it could happen and do not think there is any precedent for it happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#F00500","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Deputy's first point was about the knowledge or otherwise of energy regulation.  I will hold my hands up and say that I am certainly no expert on this.  In response to Deputy Lahart's question, I understand that while price caps could be implemented, there are certain key considerations.  The key driver of the increase in costs is the increase in raw material prices, including natural gas and oil.  The ability for energy companies to absorb this may be limited and price caps could be an issue.  In the UK, some electricity suppliers which had a price cap went out of business.  The other crucial aspect follows on from points made by Mr. O'Connor about distributive impacts of the measures taken.  A cap is broad-based by its very nature and everybody benefits.  The measures the Government introduced in February applied a mix of broad-based measures through the energy credit and using the fuel allowance, in the social welfare system, to provide additional support of &euro;225 in two lump sum payments to the 370,000 recipients of the fuel allowance.  This approach of targeting funding and support to the most vulnerable can be effective in alleviating the burden on people who are experiencing difficulties.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":33,"content":"<p>My knowledge of the consumer legislation is extremely limited, so that is new information on the use of caps.  Being a macroeconomist, the policy advice that I give is quite different to this issue.  I have limited knowledge of the profitability of energy companies in Ireland.  Some are State-owned and some are not.  The majority, with probably just one notable exception, buy energy on international markets and essentially just supply households and businesses domestically.  We have a gigantic cost shock.  If the price was capped, someone would bear the burden, including owners of those firms, which is the State in some instances.  I have not looked at the balance sheets or profitability positions, so I could not comment.  Someone has to bear the cost of what comes into the country.  The Government has made some effort to alleviate the burden on certain households.  The private sector has to bear some costs as well and probably is in some examples we have given here.  The economy, society and State as a whole are worse off from the shock.  Where the burden of policies fall has to be thought through.  It is like when one pushes something down a hole and wonders where it will pop up on the other side.  If I had given it more thought, I would probably be able to do more analysis today, but these are the thoughts I have here.<\/p> <p>  The Government has a housing policy, which I understand is settled.  The intention is to increase supply and there are various mechanisms to do so.  Supply is increasing.  First quarter numbers were the strongest in the series.  There is seasonality to housing supply.  One should not multiply the 5,000 or 6,000 units produced in the first quarter by four and end up with an annual number, because numbers generally pick up throughout the year.  Those numbers in the first quarter are encouraging and suggest a substantial increase in year-on-year supply.  Approximately 35,000 housing units have started construction in the last 12 months.  That does not mean there will be 35,000 completions in the next year.  It depends on the mix of housing units.  Some take longer than others.  We will see something in that order in the next year to 18 months.  There is unmet demand from the last decade or so.  The reasons for that are reasonably well understood and have been debated in many forums.  That demand needs to be caught up on.  It is the view of the Department and my view that increase in supply will alleviate the increase in price, whether on the purchase or rental market.<\/p><p>My view is that increasing supply is a means of alleviating the issue but there are many other policy instruments in Housing for All, which have been discussed in many fora.<\/p><p> I have answered the points made about a cap and housing.

Certainly not negative rental growth and I think that would probably have been unusual.  The Deputy is quite right that in most markets in the world one tends not to see things fall, and certainly in housing markets.  Normally they would increase at least with median income or these types of metrics.  There was definitely a different story during the Celtic tiger between the rental market and the housing market.

I have listened to a great deal of the discussion and I will try not to repeat material that has been discussed.<\/p> <p>  The cost of living is hitting many people hard and inflation has increased to almost 7%.  The cost of living is very uneven in that some people experience its impact much more than others.  For example, when we spoke to officials from the Central Bank they pointed out that rural people, people on fixed incomes and older people are hit hardest by the cost of living.<\/p> <p>  There is a range of packages available ranging between the fuel allowance, the diesel and petrol prices for school buses and so on, health charges and electricity charges to support people in different ways.

Have they identified other ways to ensure that future measures focus on supporting the people who are hit the hardest by the cost of living and price increases?<\/p> <p>  A lot of focus has been on energy being the key driver for price increases.  However, Covid restrictions and the subsequent disruption to supplies have caused a lot of price increases.  For example, the scarcity of timber and insulation products increased the price of construction.  At the moment there is much more severe Covid restrictions in China.  Also, a huge volume of business, which amounts to over &euro;20 billion, is conducted between Ireland and China and concerns a whole swathe of goods that range from textiles, machinery, electronics and every kind of a thing.  What consideration is given to the disruption in supply and the price increases that flow from same?  Have the officials measured the effects or taken them into consideration?  For example, Shanghai port is experiencing delays due to Covid restrictions and over 500 vessels are waiting outside many Chinese ports thus the unavailability of materials will have an effect in a range of places across the world and I expect that prices will increase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#H01200","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I will answer from a macroeconomic perspective and I shall answer the last query first.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right.  This time last year and any time before the war or during the winter I would have probably said that economies have re-opened and there is a massive surge in demand for goods, although services are completely restricted so consumption has shifted completely over this way, and that has driven up prices around the world.  At the same time demand is rising but there are supply shortages for the exact reasons that the Deputy has described, which occur today but occurred this time last year, but that we expect the situation to be alleviated.  I refer to things that affect the production of cars and the supply of semi-conductors and, indirectly, the supply of semi-conductors is affected by things like inert or neon gases, which come from Ukraine.  So the same problems that we had last year we are likely to have this year though admittedly for different reasons.  There is a disruption in the global supply chains but whether it is the energy stuff that we talked about earlier or imported goods into the economy a lot of it is completely imported.<\/p><p>It is very difficult, and China&rsquo;s Covid strategy will prolong these disruptions.<\/p><p> Some of the data we have seen, even in today's release in the US, shows there are starting to be reductions in, for example, the price of motor vehicles.  I raise the US data because they are the most current.  There has been a large increase in costs such as those relating to airfares and hospitality, on the services side, and some easing on the goods side.  My personal view is this stuff is still time-bound but, obviously, it is dependent on factors over which we have zero control.  Trucks that may have come from Far East manufacturers as an alternative to ships last year, when ships were constrained by certain port bottlenecks, went through Russia to get to Germany.  Obviously, that is now unavailable to them and it will take time to find alternative solutions.  It is as though sand has been thrown into the cogs; the supply chains have been completely disrupted.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that the issue is being alleviated and that it is time-bound, but the Deputy is quite right that the problem is very acute at present.  It is not unique to Ireland but is a global issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#H01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>Mr. O'Connor suggested the problem is being alleviated even though that blockage remains-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00200","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":49,"content":"<p>Yes, it is being alleviated for certain items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":50,"content":"<p>Much of our inflation is being driven by energy price rises, but this other heavyweight issue exists as well.

It has been in the system since around this time last year.  Goods were declining in price year on year for the guts of a decade, which was curious because the question arises as to whether the prices will eventually fall to zero.  The trends for services, on the other hand, were positive.  If I had showed the committee a chart on inflation, we would see an upward line, not very steep, at about 0.5% per annum.  The trends for services were all positive and those for goods were all negative, but that just abruptly stopped last year as we flipped out of the pandemic because of all these blockages associated with the pandemic, some of which remain, such as the issues in China the Deputy mentioned.  While there is evidence that some of those blockages are easing - I mentioned motor vehicles in the US - our inflation projections completely bake them in.  Non-energy, non-food core inflation will be 4% this year.  These are really high numbers in the context where, as I said, goods prices were trending towards zero, but that is not unique.  Every country is facing it.  In the US, core inflation was 6.2% in the month of April, which is really high.<\/p> <p>  This takes us back to the point we were making earlier, namely, that countries that are not producers of raw materials or fossil fuels are becoming poorer as a whole because the costs of their imports globally are increasing.  It has to be a case of burden-sharing.  We talked about the energy measures earlier.  They were an effort on the part of the Government to target and point at certain imports.  This leads me to the Deputy's first question, about the economic evidence.  He is quite right about the Central Bank research, and OECD research, published in a blog today or yesterday, shows the very same point in a cross-country sense.  Of course, lower income households spend more of their income on staples, as do older and rural cohorts, depending on their energy mix.  The best way to focus on that relates to income.  We should examine income groups and the analysis that is generally based on income.  Most of the analysis we and the Economic Social Research Institute, ESRI, have conducted seeks to find the impact of budgetary measures on various income groups.  It is correct to say older households are more severely affected, but not all older households will be in the first, second or third deciles.  In fact, what we should care about is the intersection between low income and older age.  The evidence to date, based on the analysis of the budget we carried out, the analysis the ESRI conducted on the February and March package and further analysis we have done on all of that, has consistently shown that the highest gains from these measures have always been in the lower income groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Could further measures be identified to focus on the people who are hardest hit to alleviate their difficulties?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00600","speaker":"1455"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I will hand over to my colleagues to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>In the package of measures that was introduced in February and, subsequently, in April, the focus has been to use the fuel allowance to provide targeted support.  Obviously, the fuel allowance is a means-tested payment and, therefore, as Mr. O'Connor suggested, the support can be targeted at the lower income deciles.  The key with trying to implement these measures in February and subsequently was to do so quickly.  The energy credit was a broad-based payment that provided some support to everybody.  Given that the legislation had been published, increasing it to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT, or about &euro;176 net, could be done quickly.  The legislation had been published and could be enacted quickly, with the funding put in place.  Likewise, the fuel allowance was a means of quickly getting these bullet payments, of &euro;125 in March and &euro;100 subsequently, to people in the lower income deciles.  In the budget, there was a &euro;5 per week increase for all working-age payments and pension payments, and there was an increase in the qualified child payment of &euro;2 for under-12s and &euro;3 for over-12s.  Furthermore, there were increases in the living alone allowance and the working family payment.

There is a very significant problem, as is reflected in the price of diesel as well.  The Government has responded through the various measures relating to excise, whereby it reduced excise on petrol by 20 cent and diesel by 15 cent in order to alleviate those problems.  There are limits to what the Government can do within that, given there is an excise directive that imposes a minimum level to which the State must adhere.  The Minister for Finance, in considering this and making these changes, was conscious that excise is a considerable revenue-raiser that is used to pay for the running of the State, so a balance had to be struck in trying to improve the circumstances of people who were affected by the rises in fuel costs while recognising, as I think everyone does, that it is impossible to alleviate the issue altogether.

If I am following up on things that have already been talked about, the witnesses should not hesitate to let me know.<\/p><p>One of the issues I would like to get a view on is inflation, on which there is a lot of discussion at the moment.  What we frequently hear is around a wage-price spiral.  We see that energy prices and the reopening of supply chains are driving inflation rather than wages.  I saw a graph in the <i>Financial Times <\/i>this week that showed hourly earnings in the private sector back as far as 2015 in the eurozone in comparison to the United States and Britain.  It showed that, since 2020, wage growth was almost stagnant in the eurozone but there were good gains in the US and Britain.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views in regard to evidence or lack thereof of a wage-price spiral.  If wages are not the driver, would an inflation-adjusted wage increase not be of benefit?

Where do I start?  The wage data in Ireland for the last year or two are borderline impossible to interpret.  When we get down to averages, we had 600,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in 2020 and they are all, comparatively speaking, lower-paid, part-time workers.  Therefore, we get this massive mechanical shoot-up in the average wage because we are dividing the wages of those who are still in work, which is comparatively higher, by a much smaller number.  It is very hard to interpret.  However, although they are not the official data on wages, which, as I said, are completely messed up, some data have been published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which looked at tax records for people who were in jobs in subsequent quarters, and it is almost controlling for everyone who was on PUP and similar payments.  As of the fourth quarter of last year, quarter on quarter, from the third quarter of last year, on a like-for-like basis, wage growth was of the order of 6%.  Therefore, in Ireland, for those within work over the past year or two, wage growth was actually quite strong.<\/p> <p>  That probably explains what we have seen on the income tax side, given it has been difficult to explain what has gone on with income tax in Ireland, where there was near double-digit growth last year.  Is that because of people coming back into work who lost employment because of the pandemic, or is it because of wage growth for people who are working and have continued to work?  There is no easy answer to that.  However, if we look at what happened in 2020, when we have this huge fall in employment but income tax only fell by a tiny amount, it probably speaks to those who left employment and were supported by the PUP being comparatively lower paid and, therefore, paying comparatively less tax.  Therefore, it would stand to reason that when they return to work, there would not be a huge tax dividend, which then probably speaks to the fact that if income tax in particular shot up last year, it must be to do with wage growth within the economy.<\/p> <p>  In my view, even though the national official statistics do no not show it, there is evidence from Revenue data and the like that there was quite strong wage growth in the economy.  Of course, at the same time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I am sorry to cut across Mr. O'Connor.

However, yes, it was absolutely tilted towards those sectors where profits and revenues were growing, particularly the multinational sector.  That would make sense.  If a firm is making an awful lot of profits, it is reasonable that there is a return to the people working in it.<\/p> <p>  To get to the core of the Deputy&rsquo;s question about wage-price spirals, that is the economic question of the age, namely, what do we do in an economy where there is comparatively high inflation?  All economies are quite different at the moment and the components of inflation are very different.  If we look at US data, there is a very particular story over there.  Core inflation is through the roof and is up at about 6% or 6.25%.  That is why we have seen the Federal Reserve moving and if it really wants to control it, there is probably a considerable degree of work, if we consider what market expectations are for interest rates at the very end of the year.  By the way, the US labour market is super-tight and unemployment rates are at 3.5% or something like that.  In the UK, it is kind of a similar story, which is one of pretty strong core inflation and super-low unemployment.  In the euro area, there is a bit more slack in the labour market.  That said, unemployment rates are at record lows and it is just that, historically, it has been a little higher.  However, core inflation is certainly not biting to the same extent yet in the euro area, although it is definitely picking up and, in Ireland, is expected to be of the order of about 4% this year.<\/p> <p>  If we think about inflation as a whole, there are the energy products we import and the goods we import and, basically, pretty much all goods are imported into Ireland, certainly consumer goods, although some food is produced and consumed domestically.  Then, there are services, which encompass many different things and, within services, wages account for perhaps two thirds to three quarters of costs.  Therefore, if, as a rule, we are trying to ensure that everybody should be compensated for the full price increase, that clearly goes straight into the costs of firms and, ultimately, comes out the other end.  To slightly simplify this, we can think of a market where things are quite competitive, say, fruit or if we want to buy a carrot in a market.  If some cost upstream goes into it, whether it is a fertiliser price increase or something else, the price that the customer pays increases quite quickly.  That is the wage-price spiral.<\/p> <p>  Where does that actually lead us?  If I am to pre-empt the Deputy&rsquo;s next question of what should happen with wages, it is a very difficult one to give an answer to.  Everybody tries to compare the situation today to the 1970s but it was a very different situation.  We have independent monetary institutions now, central banks with inflation targets did not really exist to the same extent back then and we had economies that were way more energy-intensive.  At the same time, we had a lot of economies where wages were simply indexed, so it completely did chase inflation.  Basically, we had increased wages, which increased costs and increased prices, which again increased wages, and that was the wage-price spiral.  That led to super-high inflation, really low output growth, in some cases recessions and very high unemployment.<\/p> <p>  I do not have an answer for the Deputy as to what should happen with wages.  I would probably say that in normal times, and we are not in normal times, we would expect wages to increase at least with productivity and some compensation for price increases, but I am not going to say that increasing it for all of us would not have an impact on inflation in a spiralling sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I will not be able to quote Mr. O'Connor the next time I am discussing this in an interview.

It now looks likely that the ECB will hike interest rates in July whereas for a very long period &ndash; obviously, this was before the war in Ukraine - the ECB was clear it was not going to increase interest rates.  If we look back to previous times, the ECB increased rates in July 2007, when we entered the global financial crisis, and it also did it in July 2011, when we entered the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.  This is something we discussed with the Central Bank officials and it was interesting to hear their response.  I have a fear that the ECB will decide to hike interest rates in the middle of war and of high inflation which is primarily due to energy prices.<\/p><p>I would be interested to hear Mr. O'Connor's view.

We have revised down our growth forecasts, as is well known, by something like 2.25% but are still posting reasonable figures in the region of 4% for modified domestic demand.  Admittedly, some of it is affected by the year-on-year comparison.  We are not in that space in a baseline sense.<\/p> <p>  I refer to what could happen with much higher energy prices.  Energy markets are extremely volatile.  At one point yesterday, gas prices fell to 11 pence before quickly going back up to 146 pence.  I was out watching my daughter play football.  It was a warm day but full of wind, so people were not purchasing gas on spot markets.  It goes to show that minor changes in the situation in Ukraine and Russia or by policymakers in Europe with regard to sanctions will have large impacts, positive or negative, on energy prices.  It is difficult to say but as the prices go up and that affects inflation, obviously there will be a spill-over to growth.  We have put that into the stability programme update in our scenario analysis.<\/p> <p>  On interest rates, I have to be careful what I say because monetary policy is completely independent so I will not give any strong views on that.  The expectation is the ECB will move.  Markets have priced in something of the order of 0.75% or 75 basis points before the end of the year.  In the US, markets expect interest rates to go to something like 2.75% to 3%, while in the UK it is of the order of 2%.  According to people who base their careers on this, European interest rates will still be considerably lower by the end of the year.<\/p> <p>  There is another concept, which I am sure any central bankers present would love to talk about, called the neutral rate of inflation.  That is the one that is neither stimulatory nor contractionary.  People have to estimate it and some make careers out of it.  If the ECB gets to 0.75% by the end of the year, it will be considerably below any estimate I have seen of the neutral rate of inflation, which means the interest rates in Europe will still be expansionary rather than contractionary.  They would have to go much higher, up to where the UK is, or even the US.  I do not expect interest rates, given what markets are expecting, to have a significant contractionary impact on the economy unless things change hugely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Farrell.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#L00300","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":67,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Connor.

He has a number of lorries on the road and purchased around 100,000 l of fuel in the first three months of the year.  The difficulty is the scheme is set up with the requirement that the haulier must purchase fuel in units of 2,000 l or more.  This company's tank is 2,500 l.  Sometimes with a contingency order, when the delivery arrives, the tank will not take 2,000 l.  This means the delivery does not qualify for the rebate.  If the lorry is on the road and running low, it may pull into a garage and use the DCI card or whatever to fill up.  Why is the scheme set up in this way?

They all have been excellent questions, like the Deputy's.  All these energy prices are imported, so there is this massive shock to the Irish economy.  Gas prices on wholesale markets in early March were ten times above their average price.  They are currently approximately three times above it, so there has been a threefold increase to energy suppliers' inputs.  Unfortunately for all of us, that is reflected in retail prices.<\/p> <p>  The Government has made its policy decisions.  The effort was to try to alleviate some of those prices for everybody to some extent and then to target additional supports for lower income groups, such as fuel allowances and so forth.  I am not 100% sure if I can say much more than that.  Controlling prices has come up previously and I had to apologise to one of the Deputy's committee colleagues earlier.  It is definitely not my realm.  I am not familiar with those legislative powers or what could be done.  All I can say is that somewhere someone has to bear these costs.  Unfortunately, energy suppliers or energy producers elsewhere in the world are benefitting and economies that import this stuff, like ours, are poorer as a result.  What does one do?  Does one try to compensate the entire economy for all of these increases?  That is one option.  It was tried previously in the 1970s and it was probably a factor for the super high inflation and low growth we got afterwards.  On the other hand, does one try to alleviate the burden for those who need it most through people who are on State supports such fuel allowances, which is the strategy that is being followed now?  They all are difficult policy choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I will follow up on those comments.  We had a brief discussion on price caps.  Apart from anything else, the key driver is the price of the gas and oil.  It would be very expensive and it is not targeted.  The Government has decided to target lower income households through the social welfare system, particularly through the fuel allowance and the two lump sum payments that have been made under that scheme, and then to provide broad-based support through the energy credit and the reductions that have been made on the taxation side, which bring us through to the budget.  It is a significant intervention.  When one totals all the interventions, they come to just over &euro;1 billion.  They certainly go some way towards addressing the issue.  The Government has set out the position that trying to compensate completely for all the price rises in energy would be a huge burden for the Exchequer to bear.  Nonetheless, the intervention that has been made is still very significant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Kinnane"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":82,"content":"<p>There is another part.<\/p><p>The closing down of Bord na M&oacute;na in the midlands means that we are using more gas to generate electricity.

Some of the questions, including those from the Deputy, would be for an energy expert or an energy economist.  Again, I must apologise to the committee but this is genuinely not an area with which I am overly familiar, in terms of what determines electricity prices or energy prices in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I would make one additional point in the context of the question of how much is the right amount of support.  We must think about where the money comes from.  The Government is currently running a deficit this year and is forecasting a very modest surplus next year.  However, as we said in the stability programme update, if energy prices go back to the levels they were at in early March, and it is not inconceivable that they would do so - there are various scenarios in which one could see that happening - then next year's surplus is gone.  The surplus would be gone simply because of higher energy prices, higher inflation in the economy and the impact they have on output.  That is without any more policy measures by the Government.  Meanwhile, the interest rate environment is completely changing.  We have seen what happened with the Bank of England last week, and with the Federal Reserve a week or two before that.  Irish bond yields which for a long time were either at zero, marginally below zero or close to zero are very close to 2% right now.  The Italian bond yields are up at around 3%.  We are seeing a big pick-up.  The so-called \"free money\" era is gone.  Basically, it is getting much more expensive for states to finance deficits.  If we want to do more, it will have to be paid for in higher debt and higher interest and that is an important consideration in the context of policy decisions and policy choices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022051100002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Brendan O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":85,"content":"<p>I welcome the 20% reduction in public transport fares for the people who can benefit from it.

There is also some analysis within the SWITCH model of households, such as impacts in cash terms on different household structures.  Regarding how confident we are in this regard, it is a difficult question to answer.  As I understand it, this approach uses data from things like CSO household budget surveys and information on incomes of household groups, etc., to try to model the impact of tax changes.  Therefore, it is a function of the data going into the model.  What the model, or the modeller, then tries to do is to adjust these things for changes in wages or inflation.

In addition, the Central Bank has since published the moneylending regulations, which address areas like advertising and targeting.  The requirements of the moneylending regulations should assist customers and consumers in becoming more informed and encourage them to consider alternatives.  These requirements include that moneylenders insert an enhanced high-cost credit warning statement in all advertisements, regardless of whether advertising refers to a rate of interest or a cost of credit.  The following text must be included in the warning statement: \"Warning: This is high-cost credit. Consider alternative options before applying for this credit, including alternatives from other lenders regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\"  The cost of credit must be clearly displayed on the moneylender's website, and they are required to provide an information notice on the application stage.  Moneylenders' advertising must be clear, not misleading, and presented in a way that customers will know that it is an advertisement.  Moneylenders can no longer make unsolicited contact on the recommendations of an existing customer, in other words, refer a friend.  This is a very important issue that deals with vulnerable people who might be looking for funding in the run-up to some of the big family events.<\/p><p> Moneylenders are required to take reasonable steps to identify customers who are vulnerable customers and to ensure they are provided with the assistance that may be necessary.  The essence of this legislation, which was not there before and which is very strong now, is that, before the moneylender gives a loan, they must look at the person's ability to repay that loan and take into account the existing financial commitments the person might have.  There is a requirement for moneylenders to consider that.  The whole tone of this legislation is that when the Central Bank is satisfied that some high-cost lenders are not actually doing that, it can have an impact on their licence.  They could have it withdrawn, suspended or, ultimately, not renewed.  This is the whole tone of the Bill.  It is not just one section the deals with this.<\/p><p> Since we have spoken, the Central Bank has published its moneylending regulations to address the issue of advertising.

It is very important that the \"refer a friend\" practice will be dealt with now under this legislation.  When somebody gets a loan, many may say to a neighbour \"This is where I got the loan\".

In many of these communities the credit unions are having an impact.<\/p> <p>  I would expect a reduction in the leaflet drops because, up to now, a key feature of moneylending has been the door-to-door collection.  It is a key feature.  People were calling to the housing estates, which Deputy Doherty referred to, monthly or weekly collecting money.  Part of that may have been the delivery of leaflets.  Under this legislation, the cost of a door-to-door collection is not facilitated.  The moneylenders cannot charge for a door-to-door collection fee.  We cannot stop them calling door to door to collect money, but they cannot charge for it or include it in the interest rate or a fee associated with the loan.  I would genuinely expect there to be a significant reduction in the number of people calling to houses in housing estates collecting money and possibly delivering leaflets when they are doing the same exercise.  It will be a by-product of this legislation.  They will not be calling around to those housing estates regularly.  There is, however, no proposal to abolish door-to-door leaflet drops.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#B00500","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":156,"content":"<p>That is a mistake in the context of how they operate and how they target vulnerable customers.  Is there anything in the legislation that will ban the practice of promoting new loans to customers who are nearing final repayments?  We challenge the interest that is being charged to someone who takes out a six-month loan from a moneylender, and we can see that they are paying possibly ten to 12 times more than if they had received the same amount of money from a credit union.  They must pay hundreds of additional euro than if they had got that loan from a credit union.  It sounds terrible that they will have paid &euro;300 or &euro;400 more, for example, but the reality for many individuals who have gone to a moneylender is the practice of continuing to keep them under the grip of the moneylender.  The moneylender advertises a loan as the current loan is expiring, which means the person is in a continuous period of high-cost credit.

There is an item in the legislation that is new and is not in existing legislation.  For the first time we will have legislation whereby the loans can only extend for 12 months.  Up to now there was not a 12-month limit and loans could roll over very simply.  It did not have to be a new loan.  Under this legislation, the loan must be repaid and it must be only a 12-month loan.  A new loan would be required to be taken for a second period.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has said that towards the end of a loan term, a customer would be offered a new loan.  The second item in the legislation that did not exist heretofore is the obligation to carry out a review of the ability to pay the loan within the 12 months before issuing that loan again.  In the past moneylenders were piling loans on people and maybe two or three moneylenders were calling to some houses.  Now there will be a requirement to know the total ability of the person taking the loan to repay it through normal credit checks.  They did not have to do those up to now.  There are approximately 40 companies in the country that will rely on the Central Bank of Ireland for approval for the period of their licence and if it finds they are not complying with the obligation and are giving loans to people where it is reasonable to say they are not able to repay the loans, it will affect the Central Bank's view.

I welcome it.  That misses the real point, however, as the default rate with moneylenders is very small anyway.  People pay these loans and the issue is not the ability to pay.  It is the fact that moneylenders are fleecing these people.  If a person borrows &euro;1,000 and pays approximately &euro;560 in interest, rolling it over by taking out a new loan each year, in four years that person will pay over &euro;2,000 in interest on the original &euro;1,000 loan.  That is the problem.  It is not ability to pay because evidence indicates the people will pay the loan.  The issue is the loan will have cost the family thousands of euro in interest over four years.  That is the problem.  The practice will be allowed to continue where Mary and Joe come to the end of their term and the moneylender might say that Seamus is going to college next year and offer a loan for that.  The lender will offer to work out the paperwork in taking out the new loan.  The &euro;1,000 that people will have \"repaid\" is still be paid and the lender will take another &euro;560 in interest.<\/p> <p>  That is the issue and it is immoral that a type of loan such as this is rolled over continuously, and this happens with many families.

The Central Bank must be satisfied and it has the ability to monitor these companies, which will now be regulated.  There are only a couple of dozen of them in the country.

The items added to this list will mean that the provider must satisfy the bank that it will be able to comply with the requirements of being a licensed high-cost credit provider, and a regulated financial service provider more generally, and that it will conduct its business in such a way as to ensure the protection of its customers - which is new - and in compliance with any other requirements considered necessary by the bank for the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of high-cost credit and the protection of the applicant&rsquo;s customers.  This legislation is, therefore, very strong on customer protection, which the Central Bank will have a role in now when the providers proceed to the renewal of a particular licence.<\/p><p>Finally, section 93 deals with the factors considered when suspending or revoking a licence.  The Central Bank will now be able to take into account whether the high-cost credit provider has failed or is failing to comply with any condition or requirement under the financial services regulation.  The Central Bank will now clearly have authority to be able to amend or revoke a licence during the course of the five-year period.  The other two amendments are minor, relatively speaking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D01900","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I must mention that acceptance of this amendment involves deletion of section 4 of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02000","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":199,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Section 4 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":202,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<\/p> <blockquote> \t  \tIn page 7, to delete line 27.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02400","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Are we dealing with amendment No. 5?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":204,"content":"<p>No, we are on section 5.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#D02550","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":205,"content":"<p>We have deleted section 4 and we have moved on to section 5.

It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, to be known as the initial cap; a simple interest of no more than 0.035% per week up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years, which would be known as the further reduced cap.<\/p><p>The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to the interest charged on a &euro;1,000 cash loan by a credit union and by the largest money lender operating in the State is significant.  Currently, on a &euro;1,000 loan over a 12-month period, a credit union charges interest of &euro;60 while a money lender, for the same loan over the same period, would charge &euro;560 in interest.  The initial cap that I am proposing for a three year period would reduce that &euro;560 down to &euro;360 but would substantially reduce it further after the three year period down to &euro;180.  The initial cap would be six times that which the credit union would apply but, as we get to the second step, it would be three times what the credit union would charge.  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which obviously have pushed up the cost of credit further in the past.<\/p><p>I argued strongly on this when my own legislation was before the House but unfortunately, the Minister voted against all sections of that Bill.  We have tweaks in some of the sections of this Bill to the licences of moneylenders, which I broadly support, but when we get down to the meat and bones of this legislation, what the Government is legislating for is to allow high-cost credit but with a warning on the label.  It is like phoning people up to tell them that they are going to get robbed in the next half an hour.  The Government is just letting them know that they are going to get robbed but what I want to do is stop the burglar coming through the door in the first place.  This amendment would still allow for substantial profits to be made on these types of loans, which have been described by others during the pre-legislative scrutiny process as immoral.  It would still allow for high interest rates to be charged, specifically in the initial period but I would argue that a step-down approach is the more appropriate way to deal with this and to bring it into line, with reference to credit union lending.  The initial cap of six times the credit union rate and then three times the rate in the further cap is appropriate.  I commend the amendment to the select committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#E00500","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his proposed amendment.  I know that Deputy Doherty has a great interest in this legislation and I can see where he is coming from with his proposal.   Lower interest rates are better for consumers.  The key purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates.  Deputy Doherty will say that Government is not being ambitious enough, but we have to strike a balance and reduce rates without reducing access to credit.  We can reduce rates right down but we might not have any companies providing credit if it is not viable from their point of view.  We want to make sure that the people we are talking about have access to credit.  If we make it unviable for providers, then people will not have access to credit except through the illegal moneylenders that we all want them to avoid.  There is a balance to be struck between reducing the rate and making sure that we keep lenders in the market.  We are looking at a substantial reduction from where we were previously.  We need to do this in a balanced, responsible way.<\/p> <p>  There is currently a concentration of loan offerings between 1% and 1.2% per week in the market.  Most of the loans tend to be in that bracket.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% per week will allow moneylenders operating at rates above the limit to revise their business model and reduce their margins to enable them to operate within the legislative cap.  This is not the ultimate destination but it is the right place to start.  The legislation also sets down the principles and policies to guide the Minister when making regulations to set the specific caps going forward.  This provides flexibility to amend the caps downwards while ensuring that there is always an upper limit in the primary legislation.  We are starting with 1% but the legislation specifically allows for that cap to be reduced.  It cannot go above 1%, but it can be reduced.  What we are saying is that at the point of introducing this legislation, we want the rate to be 1% but we are not precluding, after a couple of years when the Central Bank has monitored its operation closely, reducing that further.  That is provided for in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Doherty's proposal is to have the reduced rate now, but I would be fearful that if we go too low too quickly this will lead to fewer people offering credit.  Furthermore, to fix the reduction in primary legislation without any assessment by the Central Bank of how the legislation is operating would not be good practice.  We are starting with 1% per week, with the commitment that it can be reviewed when we get some information from the Central Bank as to how this is operating.  It may be appropriate to reduce the rate at that stage.  This is a maximum cap and represents a reasonable and balanced approach.  I understand where Deputy Doherty is coming from, but we are clear about the way we want to do this.  It is a very big step from where we are to go down to 1%, with the option of going further at a later date, on foot of information from the Central Bank, without the need to revisit the primary legislation<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#E00600","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>We went through this before but I ask the Minister of State to clarify his proposal.

The rate can reduce to the rate the Deputy is talking about, but we are saying it will just not happen on day one.  We are starting with the 1% per week and it can go down, but the view in the Department of Finance in bringing forward the legislation is that we would like to see the operation of the 1% per week for a period and get information from the Central Bank, and if it feels that the industry could continue to operate at a lower rate, this legislation specifically provides for a reduction to the rate Deputy Doherty has signposted.  Our only point of difference is we are saying we want to stick with the 1% on day one.  It is a reduction from where we were.  None of us like to see the high rates that have been in place, but we are on a road whereby we can reduce the rates at a further date.

The Minister of State has said half of the moneylenders will not be affected by the Bill because their charges are below the maximum rate and half are above it and they will be affected.  The core point that he made is that this would scare people off.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party believe that if lenders cannot charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 loan, then there is no market for them in Ireland, so we need to allow these companies to be able to charge that level of interest.  How did the Minister of State come up with that figure?

What I want to achieve in this legislation is that we have lenders that people will be able to go to, rather than go to illegal moneylenders.  It is essential that we keep the option open for moneylenders to be able to lend money even at the reduced rate we will allow, because if it is eliminated by companies not being in the market, people will only have the option to go to illegal moneylenders.  We want to make sure that we have that option available.  We could bring it down to 20% and have nobody in this market, but that would be a worst-case scenario.<\/p> <p>  In May 2019, the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process to gather views from stakeholders on whether the Government should introduce a statutory interest rate cap on moneylenders in Ireland, along with other regulatory matters.  The majority of submissions received were in favour of the introduction of an interest rate cap.  These submissions were primarily received from non-governmental organisations and credit unions.  All of the comments and submissions made through this consultation process have been considered and taken into account, as appropriate, in formulating the proposed policy options.<\/p> <p>  What we did say is we are striking a balance to make sure, first, that we are eliminating the charge for door to door collection, which is a significant feature; second, we are reducing the rate that is being charged on the majority of loans; third, it is a maximum cap that can be reduced at a further date.  We have taken all those factors into account to make sure we have people who will lend money at this rate.  There are only a couple of dozen companies operating in the country.  This is a balanced approach to achieve those three objectives.  It is not only looking at one side of the equation.  I have mentioned the other side of the equation and the reduction in fees the companies can charge in terms of not being able to charge for calling door to door.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#F01000","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State accept that the majority of moneylenders licensed in this State do not collect door to door are not licensed to apply collection charges?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#F01100","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":238,"content":"<p>I am saying that some do and some do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00100","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State accept that the majority do not?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00200","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Many of them do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00300","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":241,"content":"<p>The majority do not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00400","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Many do not apply such charges.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00500","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":243,"content":"<p>With regard to the consultation the Minister of State referred to, does he accept the majority of people who stated a rate stated one lower that than that which he is asking us to legislate for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#G00600","speaker":"1462"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":244,"content":"<p>That is correct.

It is my understanding that sections 2 and 3 relate to the deduction by insurers of Covid-19 related State supports for final business interruption insurance claim settlements.  We are all quite aware of how difficult Covid-19 has been for businesses and the impact it has had.  The fact that people had to use that business interruption insurance shows the impact it had.  The Central Bank informed my party in written correspondence in May last year that more than &euro;163 million had been paid out to in excess of 5,000 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  Over the course of the pandemic, it became apparent that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of the business interruption payouts.  That came as a major concern to businesses.  The reality is many of the insurance companies thrived during the pandemic.<\/p><p>These payments were made to assist the businesses, not big insurance companies.  I am seeking an update on this because this section deals with it.  I also have a question on sections 3 and 4 relating to the database, but perhaps the Minister of State can give an update on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#J01000","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":281,"content":"<p>This is an important new section in the legislation regarding deducting the value of State supports.  That issue became apparent as the Covid-19 situation emerged.  There is a general misunderstanding among the public because many of the insurance companies had said they would not deduct any payments the State had made from any payments they would be making under business interruption policies.  Many people felt that all that funding was going to come back to the State.  However, what the companies that made those statements did not say is that the vast majority of them had no business interruption policies to start with.  When they knew they had no business interruption policies, it was very easy to make a statement that they would not deduct any State payments from any payments they might be making because they were making no payments anyway.  That point has not been picked up fairly across the industry.  I am putting it on the record now because a narrative about this issue has carried through in that respect.  With regard to the figure the Deputy mentioned, most of that relates to one particular company.  Most of the other companies that have spoken on this in various public venues said they would not be deducting from any of this because they were not providing business interruption policies to start with.  I want to make that clear.  They were correct in what they said, but people did not fully grasp the subtlety of what they were saying.<\/p> <p>  When this issue arose and it came to our attention during the course of the pandemic that the limited number of insurance companies that had business interruption policies were deducting some of the State payments so that the business or sometimes sole traders, if they were publicans or restaurateurs, would receive the net loss, there was concern in the Department and the Government that the insurance companies might make a profit from the State supports.  We immediately examined this matter closely with a view to dealing with it, but it became clear from legal advice that it was not possible to legislate retrospectively.  Bear in mind that these policies might have been written before the Covid-19 pandemic and these payments happened during it.  When we saw this happening, it was not possible to come back and change a policy that was written 18 months or two years previously because it was a legal document.  It was not possible to look back retrospectively to claim payments in respect of policies that were issued and in existence before that.<\/p> <p>  The issue that arises then, and I would put this down as one of the big lessons from Covid, is that we saw what happened.  The reason we are introducing these sections is so we can gather information on these supports, and if any other situation arises in the future, we will have a base to work from and to understand how it works.  It might not be related to Covid.  Some other issue could arise in the country where there is an insurance policy and the State is also supplementing some of the cost.  This is a forward-looking legislative measure and it is important that it be seen in that context.<\/p> <p>  I will make another point.  The reason I looked at this at that stage was that I was conscious that, under the Department of Social Protection, other State payments may be relevant to insurance claims.  There already are processes in place.  We already had legislation in place dating back many years strictly to deal with what is known as the recovery of benefits and assistance scheme by the Department of Social Protection.  I will explain it simply.  Let us say somebody was in a car accident and he or she was out of work for a significant period and received disability payments for a period.  Then the insurance company settles the claim in due course.  It estimates the value of the person's claim at &euro;100,000, for example, but the person has already received &euro;20,000 from the State.  If the company pays out the &euro;100,000 there is a legal mechanism in place for the insurance company to refund that &euro;20,000 back to the State.  That happens currently.  Ultimately, we want to get to that situation across the board, but the first thing we must do is gather information on this.<\/p> <p>  On the up-to-date figure I have in respect of business interruption policies, the Central Bank has stated that a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling claims as a result of the Central Bank's intervention.  I welcome recent data to the end of February 2022 which show that more than &euro;171 million has been paid to 5,312 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This is up from the earlier figure.<\/p> <p>  Another point is that this matter is still before the courts, so the matter may yet come to light as part of the quantum hearing in ongoing litigation that remains before the courts.  The approach of the Bill is designed to ensure we do not pre-empt any legal ruling by passing legislation at this stage before the relevant court cases are dealt with.  This issue may be raised during those quantum hearings which are not yet concluded.  From that point of view, I am precluded from saying anything further on this because, as people will appreciate, the matter is currently before the courts.<\/p> <p>  However, this is really a lesson learned for the future.  We want to have a cross-government approach.  We already have it in the Department of Social Protection and, ultimately, I would like to see this in any Department where a similar situation could arise in the future.  The first thing that must be done is gather the information so the Central Bank will be able to give us information.  When we get that information we can then look at policy implications and draw up legislation in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":282,"content":"<p>Although my next question is about the information, it relates to sections 3 and 4, so I will wait until we get to section 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K00300","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":283,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":284,"content":"<p>SECTION 3<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":285,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 3 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Sections 3 and 4 require, as part of the national claims information database, data on any deductions from insurance claims settlements by insurance companies that relate to public moneys.

I have an open mind, but my instinct is no insurance company should profit on any State supports, and I believe there would be a unanimous view in the House on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K01000","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Absolutely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K01100","speaker":"1579"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":291,"content":"<p>However, we do not have information to draft legislation accurately at this stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K01200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":292,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":293,"content":"<p>Section 4 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":294,"content":"<p>SECTION 5<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1652223600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 5 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I have a question on this.  Sections 5 and 6 relate to the issue of dual pricing.  Unfortunately, this practice is where companies are identifying loyal but often vulnerable customers who might not have the ability to look around insurance companies and are less likely to shop around, but are also more than likely more sensitive to price changes and so forth.  It is often recognised that price gouging undermines the interests of loyal customers, and this has long been talked about in the House.<\/p><p>Indeed, it is something a lot of customers talk about a lot as well.  It is welcome that the Central Bank is taking action in regard to banning price discrimination.  This is clearly something Deputy Pearse Doherty has been campaigning on for a long number of years and, in fact, he submitted a complaint as far back as October 2019.<\/p><p> What is important is that when regulations come into force, they are kept under constant review.  We know that the Central Bank had previously found that 2.5 million customers were paying a combined &euro;187 million more than the actual cost of their policies, which is very significant.  Can the Minister of State advise in regard to keeping these regulations under constant review, if that will be happening and how he sees that going forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#K01700","speaker":"1579","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":298,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her constructive comments.  I acknowledge the role of her party colleague, Deputy Doherty, in dealing with this topic over a period of time.<\/p> <p>  We had complicated issues with price walking and dual pricing, and they were connected issues but subtly different in their own way.  What is happening here is that we are dealing with this issue as part of the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance across all Departments.  To put the insurance plan in context, the relevant committee is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, so the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is involved, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I am also involved from the Department of Finance because insurance is a regulated industry.  The committee also involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and, in particular, the Minister for Justice because much of the legislation comes from the Department of Justice with regard to insurance.  It is a whole-of-government approach.<\/p> <p>  In dealing with the action plan for insurance, all the bodies I have mentioned have different roles on different aspects, different legislation comes from the Department of Justice, and State agencies like the Central Bank have a key role in implementing some of the measures.  The Department of Finance has put forward this Bill and we also helped bring forward legislation on the personal injuries guidelines six months earlier than had originally been envisaged.  Right across that committee, different sections of the State are doing different operations.<\/p> <p>  In this section, what we have is an acknowledgement that the Central Bank has agreed to implement this from 1 July for dual pricing only.  That is in regard to motor policies, whereby people should get a price equivalent to that of a new customer.  We have had what we call the loyalty penalty, whereby people who are with an insurance company and never seek to move to another company may well have been paying too much for not doing that.  After nine years, they would be paying a penalty of about 12% or 14%.  The issue in the house insurance market is even more serious and, after nine years, some people are paying up to 34% over and above what they would be paying if they were a new customer going into the same insurance company to insure the same house for the same value.<\/p> <p>  That is extraordinary but understandable.  Just around Leinster House, I have asked people which company their house insurance is with and they reply that they got their house insurance when they took out their mortgage, and they are not exactly sure.  Very few people query their house insurance because it just goes through as part of the mortgage payment.  For that reason, I think insurance companies have abused the situation and loyal customers, and they were adding a small percentage, year by year, knowing people would never check it.  I encourage people to find out which company their house insurance is with in the first place, and to make sure they make the phone call at the next renewal date.<\/p> <p>  From 1 July, this practice is going to be outlawed by the Central Bank.  The amendment in this section arises because the Department of Finance has insisted that the Central Bank will not just do it, because it will do it, but that it will produce a report within a set timeframe of one year after the coming into being of the Act, or as quickly as possible thereafter.  I am sure that report will be published by the Central Bank directly as well.  We have asked for some interim information after a six-month period to see the effect of this change.  There is no point in something happening if we do not have the evidence to track it.  Our role here is to make sure there is a reporting mechanism back into the system.  This practice has been ongoing for ages and it is now coming to an end.  We want the evidence and the proof that it is coming to an end.  That is why we have this section to make sure there is a clear report from the Central Bank in regard to those areas.<\/p> <p>  We are the first country in the EU to introduce this price walking ban.  Other countries in the EU have been talking about it and England has commenced a similar but slightly different approach, but we are the first country in the EU to introduce this.  This is to ensure the Central Bank comes back to us next year with the hard information and then, like everything else, when we get the information, we will be in a position to take whatever policy decisions are required.  I expect that, given the fact the Central Bank is outlawing the practice straightaway from 1 July, we will see reductions in those cases for loyal, long-standing customers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#L00200","speaker":"1590"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":299,"content":"<p>It is shocking that insurers have been doing that.

In regard to the companies, the Central Bank can seek information, it can do audits and, as with previous issues, it will write to the chief executives to correct this.  It has powers in regard to the licences of these companies to ensure they comply with good practice and consumer protection.

In order to protect consumers&rsquo; interests, section 11 amends the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015.<\/p><p> These amendments will provide for technical changes in order to address two issues identified by the Central Bank of Ireland and relating to the scope of an insurance temporary run-off regime for UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers.  This arises directly as a result of Brexit.  The temporary run-off regime was established to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers from the Irish market following the departure of the UK from the EU in order to protect almost 35,000 policyholders.  Those companies provided insurance policies to 35,000 policyholders but are now withdrawing from the market because of Brexit.  The aim was to enable such firms to continue to service their existing portfolio of business for up to 15 years in order to ensure service continuity of those insurance contracts for existing Irish policyholders.  Other EU member states also introduced similar provisions.<\/p><p> Section 11 provides for the following changes to the scope of the temporary run-off scheme.  First, it amends the 2015 regulation to provide that UK and Gibraltar firms in the temporary run-off regime that are in the process of running off their existing insurance liabilities in the State may provide third-party reinsurance business here.  This change will align the temporary run-off regime with the provisions of the 2015 regulations whereby third-country undertakings can carry on reinsurance activities in the State, provided that they satisfy certain conditions.  This should also assist to preserve reinsurance capacity in the Irish market.   This is to facilitate the wind-down in an orderly manner.<\/p><p> Section 11 further amends the 2015 regulations to enable firms in liquidation that otherwise satisfy the conditions of the temporary run-off regime but may have had their authorisation withdrawn under the law in the UK or Gibraltar prior to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU to enter into the regime and run-off their Irish insurance portfolio in order to terminate their activity in the State.  This is a separate provision to deal with insurance companies that have gone into liquidation and will not be continuing in the long term.  This is necessary as the current wording of the 2015 regulations makes it a condition of entry to the temporary run-off scheme that the entity was, immediately before the relevant date, authorised as an insurance undertaking under the law in the UK or Gibraltar.  However, some firms in liquidation may have had their authorisation withdrawn before 2021 on the opening of the winding-up of the proceedings and, therefore, would not otherwise be able to enter the temporary run-off scheme.  It is important to note that these changes to the 2015 regulations merely reflect what was the original policy intent behind the temporary run-off scheme.  The amendments will not give UK- or Gibraltar-based insurance firms any competitive advantage over firms based in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU or EEA.  As it is an issue relating to dates, we were concerned that these firms would be captured.  It may be the case that some companies that were in liquidation and had their authorisation withdrawn before 1 January may not otherwise be able to fully avail of this temporary run-off scheme.  There is no change in policy; it is just a clarification of an issue relating to dates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2022051100002#L02000","speaker":"1590","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I am also joined by Ms Ita O'Sullivan and Mr. John O'Donoghue, members of the HSE's legal team for this project.<\/p> <p>  While there is good, proper and important debate about this issue, I believe we all agree on many of the important issues relating to this project.  First, clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, provide excellent care to women and infants and have been leaders in modernising women&rsquo;s healthcare.  Second, a new and modern hospital building is urgently needed for the National Maternity Hospital and services for women need to be expanded there.  Third, the new hospital should be built beside a major adult hospital to ensure women will have access to the widest possible range of healthcare.  Fourth, the new hospital must be fully clinically independent and there must be no religious influence, now or in the future.  Fifth, the new hospital must provide all services and all procedures that are permissible under law.  Finally, the State&rsquo;s investment must be protected.<\/p> <p>  The proposal we are discussing meets all of these goals.  This is a partnership between the State, the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The National Maternity Hospital will provide all the clinicians, who will move from Holles Street to the new building, and the National Maternity Hospital will run the new hospital.  The State will fund the construction of the new hospital building and retain full ownership of the building as an asset, while St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group will provide lease ownership to the State for 300 years.  Each party will appoint three directors to the new board of the NMH, and the NMH will, in turn, appoint directors to the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The two hospitals will be physically connected to ensure seamless access to care for patients, which is especially important for critically ill patients.  Both hospitals will provide shared services to be used throughout the healthcare campus.  Many clinicians will work in both hospitals, as they do now.<\/p> <p>  A structure was agreed in the 2016, namely, the Mulvey agreement, whereby the shares in the NMH charitable company will be owned by the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group charitable company.  This provides St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group with some administrative rights relating to, for example, accepting annual accounts at general meetings and approving the appointment of auditors.  The national maternity hospital will be fully clinically, operationally and financially independent.  It will have its own constitution and its own operating licence with the HSE.  All procedures that are currently carried out at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street will be provided at the new national maternity hospital.  The new hospital will provide all maternity, gynaecology, obstetric and neonatal services that are legally permissible.  These include, but are not limited to, terminations, tubal ligations and gender-reaffirming procedures.  Religious involvement in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has ended with the transfer of shares.  Religious involvement in the National Maternity Hospital will also end.  For example, the chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital since its foundation has been the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Religious influence of any kind is expressly prohibited in the new national maternity hospital.  There is no mechanism for any religious involvement, now or at any time in the future, in either St. Vincent's Healthcare Group or the new national maternity hospital.<\/p> <p>  Ireland does not have a good track record when it comes to religion and women&rsquo;s reproductive health.<\/p><p>It has a poor and dark history.  Women are, therefore, rightly demanding that when it comes to our new national maternity hospital there can be no religious involvement whatsoever at any point, now or into the future.  Women and, indeed, men are right to demand that.  People for very understandable reasons are demanding absolute assurances that all legally permissible services are provided, and they are right to make that demand.  All of these services are provided in Holles Street today.  The same clinicians, some of whom are here today, are going to provide these new services in the new hospital.<\/p><p> Concerns are understandably being raised and questions are being asked about land ownership and other issues.  I look forward to discussing these issues with the committee.  I also look forward to hearing from the people who provide the services in Holles Street.  Those of us who campaigned for repeal of the eighth amendment said we must listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity hospitals.  That is what I asked people to do in Wicklow when I walked up and down the streets and knocked on doors week after week.  Some of those same clinicians are with us today.  I hope that on this important issue, we will once again listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity services and providing these services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#C00300","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It has, therefore, been incumbent upon four Ministers for Health - my predecessors, Dr. James Reilly, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and me - and two Governments to make sure those concerns are addressed absolutely and the new hospital we set up not only provides all of the guarantees and services that are needed, but gives space to expand the provision of those services and many other women's healthcare services, including maternity, obstetrics, fertility and gynaecology.  I ask for a response to the Deputy's question, because it goes to the heart of everything we are doing here, from some of the clinicians who are working and providing the services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for giving us an opportunity to come and tell our stories and to outline why this hospital is so important.  I agree with the Minister.  Ireland has been through a lot.  When we look back at the history of women's health in particular and the interplay between church and State, it has been very difficult for women.  It has had a profound impact on women's health and lives.  We are now moving forward into a different Ireland.  We have seen huge advances in the past ten years.  The campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment was a real moment for me.  I remember attending a meeting of a health committee, just like this one, in 2013 when I was pretty much a lone voice.  I was not as lonely as all the women who had gone to Europe to fight their cases on their own.  By 2018, we had all come together and we had a movement and could talk about and express what happened to women.  That was a pivotal point in our history in terms of moving forward in women's health.<\/p> <p>  With this project, we are moving forward again.  We are saying goodbye to the church completely.  There is no religious ethos pertaining in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is a complete separation.  We are moving forward and leaving that behind.  However, we are moving forward in a different way.  The vision for this hospital is a vision of enormous possibility for what we can give to women in this country.  It is not just about the old facilities in Holles Street where women are crowded into tiny wards and long 14-bed wards, where we do not have an intensive care unit, ICU, or high-dependency unit, HDU, where babies are crammed into units in which their parents cannot be with them and where there are no toilets and a lack of showers.  We have heard a great deal about this.  The new facility is going to be magnificent.  We will have a facility where the tiniest citizens in the State, babies as small as 23 weeks and weighing 500 g, will be in a magnificent, dedicated pre-term birth centre and their parents can stay with them and be involved in their care.  A neonatal intensive care unit is a really scary place.  We know this has much better outcomes for babies.  We will have proper labour rooms.  We will give expression to the maternity strategy in terms of having all that choice for women, with midwifery-led birthing units, birthing pools and beautiful rooms.  Women will have dignified, single-room accommodation across the whole building.  We will have proper operating theatres.  The key here is that those operating theatres will link into St. Vincent's hospital, the very place we need them to link into, and also into the hospitals ICU and HDU, which Holles Street does not have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  It is much more than that, however.  I think the piece we have missed is what is on the campus of St. Vincent's hospital.  Women have been hearing a lot and have been worried that the services available to them will be restricted.  It is quite the opposite.  We will be hugely increasing services.  The St. Vincent's hospital campus deals with 150,000 inpatient and day-patient cases every year.  There are 50 clinical specialties, more than 200 consultants and 5,000 staff delivering a whole gamut of healthcare services which will be available for women.  The hospital already cares for 500 women with breast cancer every year who are treated there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":338,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Mahony have any worries about any possible religious influence on the procedures that may or may not take place in the hospital?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#D00600","speaker":"1584"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":339,"content":"<p>I absolutely do not, for two main reasons.

The conditions are that we, the State, remain as the tenant running healthcare services there.  By agreement, that can be changed but essentially once we are running our hospital on the site, that is that.  There is a condition that we do not look to acquire freehold ownership of the site.

Those conditions relate to the State continuing to provide public healthcare facilities from that building into the future and for the term of 299 years.  That protects both parties.  It protects St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which owns the freehold interest in the site, to ensure that the State does not try to change the use of the facility to something else.  This facility will be state-of-the-art but in less than 299 years, it will need to be redeveloped, replaced and refurbished.  There is no guarantee that it will be required as a public hospital facility in the future so there is no reason for the State to have a freehold interest, or an interest into infinity, on that site.

There is nobody in this room who does not want a new national maternity hospital.  I do not dispute that Holles Street is not fit for purpose.  The Rotunda Hospital is not fit for purpose.  Of course we need a new national maternity hospital but we have wider responsibilities.  We have to protect patients, clinicians and the interests of the taxpayer.

My understanding is people have talked about this for decades.  Doctors hired by Holles Street in the 1960s were asked when they were going to move to co-locate with the adult hospital.  The process as we understand it now began in 2013 when the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the intention to move.  This was on the back of a KPMG report, which he received.  In July of that year, the campus project board was established by the HSE and in 2015 a memo to Government on the relocation of the Coombe and the Rotunda, which we should talk about on another day, noted the recommendation that Holles Street should move to Elm Park, in effect.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the Mulvey agreement was brought together.  My understanding is the negotiations were complex and at times difficult so Mr. Mulvey was brought in to chair that.  The Mulvey agreement was put together and, in essence, the corporate structures and what we see today came out of that agreement.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and she may want to add her comments on it.  In 2017, there was a memo to Government from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, with information on the relocation.  Planning permission was secured in 2017 and in 2018 there was another memo to Government on the relocation and agreement in principle on some of the key areas.  In 2018, the contract for the first phase was announced.  As the Deputy will be aware, significant works have already happened, such as pharmacies, car parks and so forth.<\/p> <p>  What changes have been made since then?  In essence, we have moved from a 99-year lease to a 299-year lease, or from 100 years to 300 years.  We have moved from one public interest director to three.  It was one-four-four; it is now three-three-three and, critically, we have written the constitution.  All parties have been involved in that.  The constitution is essential to all this because it is the operating manual and the legal instructions for how the NMH will work.  What we have done with it is very important.  We are not only guaranteeing clinical and operational independence through the constitution, which everyone has rightly demanded, we have gone much further, which I am advised by the Attorney General is either very rare or unique.  We are not just saying the new hospital can provide all services; we are saying it must provide all services.  We have said six times in the constitution there can never be any religious influence whatsoever.  The board of directors is obliged under its constitution to ensure all services are provided.  As a final certainty, the Minister for Health has the power to intervene at his or her discretion to ensure that all services are provided without any religious influence at all.  The three big changes are boards of directors, the lease and the constitution.<\/p> <p>  With permission, Mr. Devane will come in on the matter of the board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#G00400","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":412,"content":"<p>We had a number of very good, very detailed and very robust debates over the past 12 months to try to address all the issues people are legitimately concerned about and to which they want to see a solution.

We wanted to see some of the details on the duration of the lease consistently written into all the documents across the whole agreement.

He said the decision was taken to open up the issue prior to the Cabinet meeting.  That is hard to understand because I recall very clearly the Taoiseach, on his way into that Cabinet meeting, saying to the media that he was entirely satisfied with the proposals and had no concerns whatsoever.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a similar comment prior to the meeting.  At any rate, for one reason or another, the decision was taken to open this up.

I thank all the witnesses for the work they do and for coming along here today.<\/p> <p>  I have to say that I feel that we are in the middle of something really weird.  Drip-fed bits of information keep coming at us, as elected politicians.  We are not getting the full truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  For example, the Minister has just told the committee this morning that parts of the new national maternity hospital will be occupied by other elements of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that have been displaced.  He cannot clarify for us if that will all be public, all private or a mixture of both.  I find that really upsetting.  We are getting this drip-fed information bit by bit when we have an opportunity to delve down.  <\/p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane said that for the last year they have been debating and robustly listening to queries about this project.  Yet, we have been in here asking questions for the last year and we have been getting no answers.  I do not know how many times most of us in the Opposition stood up in the D&aacute;il to ask for full debates about the future of the national maternity hospital.  We are now getting it, after kicking up a fuss and having been told that we are guilty of a campaign of disinformation or misinformation.<\/p><p>The Minister has come in today and is remembering the moment of repeal and the seismic shift that was for the women of this country.  Members of the Government engaged in that campaign, whether they were knocking on doors or advocating for it and that was helpful but repeal changed everything.  When you look back at the history of the debate, discussion and negotiations around the new national maternity hospital that go back to 2012 and 2013, it seems to me from what the Minister has told us today that the bones and structures were all agreed pre-repeal.  How much did post-repeal Ireland change that discourse and discussion?  It must have changed it.  A lot of that discourse and discussion took place when the sisters or nuns were still on the field.  We are told that they are gone from the field and we are repeatedly told that no religious influence will be allowed.<br\/><br\/>I want to put the following thesis to the Minister.  In the same week we got the announcement that the Cabinet was about to sign off on this arrangement the US Supreme Court leak happened.  It was leaked that Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade was about to be seriously challenged and possibly taken down.  For me, as somebody who has fought for repeal and abortion rights all of my life, that was shocking.  I understand, as many women in this country do, that for women's healthcare and reproductive rights you make two steps forward and you can take four back.  That happens because there will always be a kickback and a backlash against women's rights.  That is part of the way our society has been structured.  Women's oppression has always involved us making gains and them lashing back against us.  Religious interference does not always appear in nuns with long veils traipsing the corridors in the image of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead.  That is not what we mean when we talk about religious interference.  We mean a deep-seated and deep-rooted prejudice and an in-built thinking about women's health that goes into the heart of the Civil Service, the health service and the political establishment.  It is something that cannot be seen and it does not wear a veil but it traipses around our bodies and lives all of the time and I am seriously worried that this concern will be dismissed.  The Minister said six times that it is in the Constitution, that there will be no religious interference and that this cannot be true.  That is nonsense and that is not the way it works.<br\/><br\/>I am delighted that the Minister acknowledged this morning that there is a much more deep-seated sociological reason for the mistrust around this deal and that it is not just headcases like me or others giving out misinformation.  There is a deep-seated reason for it.  We have to deal with that deep-seated reason and to do so we need much more than we have had until now in terms of reassurances from the Minister that there will be no religious interference.  For that we need to know why the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will have deep-seated and deep-rooted ties to the religious orders, will have the right to appoint three board directors and to appoint the chair every few years.  Why does it have that right?  If this is to be an utterly independent national maternity hospital for the women of Ireland to deliver all reproductive and maternity care then why does it want that interest?  It seems to really and passionately want it.<br\/><br\/>Its fact sheet is extremely interesting and it does not provide the sort of facts the Minister gives us when he repeats that we own it.  Mr. O'Donoghue keeps telling us that we &quot;effectively&quot; own it because of these leasehold rights but we do not.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land and the rights and that it is on the board because of this, that and the other.  I am deeply suspicious of its interest in this project.  The Minister for Health was involved in devising Sl&aacute;intecare and I do not understand why we would use all this public money and this opportunity to create a truly one-tier medical system with no discrimination against people based on the depth of their pockets or the size of their wallets with a clearly publicly-owned and funded national maternity hospital in this way.  Why do we not take the opportunity to have that?  That is clearly not what we have and the plot thickens when the Minster tells me about the private elements that will be in the building and about the clinical independence.<br\/><br\/>Somebody mentioned Savita Halappanavar.  I think of her every day but I did not want to mention her name.  However, now that she has been dragged up I want to say that as she was dying, somebody took a decision that it was clinically inappropriate to give her the abortion that she and her husband asked for.  Somebody took that decision and even then, pre-repeal, it was legally permissible to do that to save her life.  Clinical appropriateness can be decided by somebody who does not agree with my view of the right to choose and of a woman's control of her body.  That could still happen with that the phrase &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; mixed up with the term &quot;legally permissible&quot;.  It is obfuscating in terms of where women stand.  What about what they want, rather than what the clinicians want?<br\/><br\/>We need to delve down into this much more and we need more time and reassurance.  If we removed the ownership of the land from the equation, we would get rid of this labyrinthine structure that has been described as Kafkaesque, involving three boards of management with three constitutions and three ways of appointing people and the State would deal directly, once and for all, with the future of women's health.  I would like the clinicians and the Minster to address those concerns that I still have, despite this long debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#K03400","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":541,"content":"<p>I fully agree with the Deputy and I appreciate her acknowledging that this is a deep-seated mistrust that goes back for generations and it is understandable that this mistrust is there.  I will make a few quick points as follows.  First, a view has been expressed that we could just own the land and the building and that it could be a HSE hospital.  We could take the current national maternity hospital out of it and it could be a HSE-run hospital.  There are 19 maternity hospitals or units in the country and at the start of the year, ten of them provided services.  By the end of the year 14 of them will provide services, so we are all moving in this direction.  There are 11 maternity hospitals providing services right now and the eight that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.  We own the land and the buildings in those hospitals and there are no voluntary structures there whatsoever.  The hospitals that have led post repeal are the voluntary hospitals and the people sitting with us today.  The idea that has been put forward that if they were just HSE hospitals then that would solve the problem is clearly not correct because the eight maternity hospitals that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.<\/p> <p>  Second, the ownership of the land is not linked to the appointment of directors.  The land under the National Maternity Hospital, Holles St., is owned by the Earl of Pembroke, whoever that is, and he has no influence.  If the Deputy owned the land and we were getting a leasehold ownership for 300 years from her then she would not be appointing any directors.  The directors are being appointed because this is a partnership.  The national maternity hospital, which does not own the land under St. Vincent's University Hospital, is appointing directors to that board as well.  I might ask the clinicians about this.  Could Ms Brosnan come in on this point?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#L00200","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":542,"content":"<p>Before she comes in, I will make a point.

I am passionately interested in this project as are so many stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked particularly about why dermatology is in the building.  There are very detailed maps available for everybody to scrutinise this.  Much of St. Vincent's campus will be disrupted to build this very large structure.  It is around 50,000 m2 of which 35,000 m2 to 40,000 m2 will be the national maternity hospital's business.  There is another part of that campus that will be shared services, particularly all the catering and all the sterile services department.  They will all be shared and quite a lot of other facilities.<\/p> <p>  The other element is that St. Vincent's current campus will lose a lot of its space.  Procurement, ward areas such as dermatology and transitional care beds all had to be planned into the new service.  There is a very large, long, L-shaped building in the plans.  At the moment it is configured as a red block in the diagrammatic schematic picture.  If you drill down, there is an L shape which is built into five or six different elements, that is, our own big build - hopefully- the shared services and what St. Vincent's needs to build to replace what we are taking over.  It is very complicated because it is a working hospital.  It is the largest campus hospital in south Dublin and Leinster, almost.  A huge amount of work will be required to be done in the middle of a working campus.  It is complicated.  We phased it.  There was originally discussion of doing it in two phases and now it will hopefully be built in one.

Fair play to Ms Brosnan for having such confidence that she can guarantee the future of women's healthcare in terms of abortion in this country.  Nobody in the United States can guarantee it for women in America and they have had it long, long before we have had it.<\/p> <p>  While I have a minute, I want to thank Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin for their statement this morning.  They have been hugely courageous in providing that statement to us.  It should be published and everyone should read it.  In the closing paragraph they express their concerns on governance and control.  It noted that: \"Although the agreed clause in relation to services will facilitate the provision of all legally permissible services at the new NMH boards also influence the culture, values, and ethics of the entity they govern, and this gives rise to the legitimate concerns for us about the potential influence of ethos\".<\/p> <p>  I return to how we have three sets of appointees on a board of management instead of a Minister for Health - who I do not fully trust at the moment because of everything I have heard that contradicts what I am reading; even if I trusted the Minister for Health - being able to appoint the directors of the boards or some entity that does not have the vested interest of the St. Vincent's Hospital group and others.  I do not trust it and I think that is shared by many others in the country.  We have a statement from these two eminent people who dissented from the decision on 13 March to go ahead with this deal on 14 March.  I think people need to take note of that statement.  The idea that ethos can influence medicine is always there.  We need much more to guarantee that just because the nuns have gone off the pitch, the influence of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have much more weight than it ought to.  I want to thank the two women for taking the courageous step of making that statement.  <\/p> <p>  I am publicly asking the Minister to hold off on making the decision until we delve down much further into what is going on.  I have heard Dr. Mahony repeatedly talk about how bad things are in Holles Street.  I understand that.  I disagree with some commentators who have said it is like a slaughter house.  It is not like a slaughter house.  I have friends who gave birth there in the last year and they got on very well.  We need to calm down a bit.  We need to step back and really delve down into what we are doing here.  We need to give it more time.  If we have given it eight or 12 years, it can take another bit more time to get it right.  We took a long time with the national children's hospital.  That is costing us a load of money but at least it is being built on a campus where they own the land and are sharing the state-of-the-art facilities and medical facilities with St. James's without all this nonsense of three boards of directors and three constitutions and three mixed-up ways of dealing with things.  Why could we not do the same as with the national children's hospital and St. James's with this?  It is because St. Vincent's Healthcare Group do not want it.  It wants a huge influence on this hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#M00800","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":555,"content":"<p>If I might come back in on the comment about the slaughter house.

We know that simply having it as a public hospital on public land run by the HSE by definition does not guarantee it because all the hospitals that are not guarantee it because all the hospitals that are not providing services are that model.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy says she does not trust St. Vincent's to appoint board members and that she does not trust the Government or future Governments to appoint board members -----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#M01800","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":565,"content":"<p>No.  I did not say that I do not trust everybody.

I thank the Senator.  My view is that it is not acceptable that there are eight HSE hospitals that are not providing those services.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  It is one of the things that is being looked at in the review of the operation of the Act.  However, the direction of travel is very important.  With regard to what is happening right now, this year, we will have gone from ten hospitals to 14 hospitals providing termination services.  That is very important.  This is the second year in which the maternity strategy will have been fully funded.  This year and last year, we have been in the process of setting up a national network of new women's health services in gynaecology, menopause, endometriosis and infertility.  I hope to secure funding in the budget to make publicly funded IVF available next year and to begin to phase that in.  We are introducing free contraception this year, starting with young women from 17 to 25.  Women's healthcare, including all of the services we are talking about today, is an absolute priority for this Government.  An entire national network of service provision is being built at the moment.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to say the word \"ironic\" but one of the things that is interesting about this debate is that, although some may have, I have never heard anyone question Holles Street with regard to termination services.  Is it not interesting that two of the members of the board of Holles Street are priests?  One of them, the Catholic archbishop of Dublin, is the chair.  That role is agreed as part of the articles of association of the hospital, dating from the 1800s.  What we are essentially doing is moving the National Maternity Hospital, which everyone accepts is a leader in women's health services, to a state-of-the-art building, to which that hospital is contributing because it is selling its building on Holles Street.  We are putting in nine new directors and replacing all of those old structures.  Right now, we do not own the land under the Holles Street hospital and we do not own the building.  The chair of the board is the archbishop of Dublin.  There are elected representatives, councillors, on the board but there are no ministerial appointments to the board.  That hospital is not obliged, under its constitution, to provide all of these services.  We are moving to a new model and a state-of-the-art hospital co-located with an adult hospital.  The new hospital will be legally obliged to provide all services, any religious influence is expressly disallowed and the Minister and State have the power to intervene if necessary.  It is interesting to look at where we are and what we are proposing.<\/p><p>What we are doing here is taking any religious involvement out.  We are moving from relying on the wonderful clinicians in Holles Street to provide the services to mandating that they must provide them.  That is what is happening here.  It is very interesting to look at where we are and where we are going; we are moving in exactly the right direction.

It has been suggested that the national maternity hospital being a separate company is a bad thing but it is actually a really good thing.  The Mulvey agreement fell apart for its first two mediations because we were going to be a branch of St. Vincent's and I very much wanted us to be an independent company.  People have described us as a subsidiary but we are a separate legal entity.  I just want to go through some of the layers.  This is a company that is dedicated to the provision of healthcare for women.  It is actually different from the other hospitals in Ireland.  It is different from the HSE hospitals where one cannot mandate for a termination to take place where one does not have all of the layers of protection.

The first point is that the operation of the hospital is transferring from its charter to a new company, NMH Designated Activity Company, DAC, which is an independent legal entity.  That provides protection of itself because company law means that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will, from the outset, have very limited scope to interfere.  On top of that, as the Minister has said, the next really important piece is the constitution of the DAC, which is really and truly enshrining all of the values and principles that we considered so important, when we were designing this, to protect women.  The principle, which is now enshrined in the legal framework, is that the hospital will have clinical, financial and operational independence and without getting too legal, we will be able to provide all legally permissible services without religious ethos or other distinction.<\/p> <p>  The next layer, and the really big piece, is the reserved powers which cover the independent operation of the hospital.  They are exercised independently by the directors and any service that is legally permissible is available.   We also have the Minister's direction to ensure that those reserve powers are exercised.  People keep saying that this hospital is a 100% subsidiary but it actually has a really special share, called a golden share.  That golden share is held by the Minister and it has very special powers.  It protects the inviolability of the reserve powers and ensures that the director's obligations are provided for.<\/p> <p>  The next layer is the board of directors.  We have heard a lot of comment about directors and some suggestions that directors coming from St. Vincent's would act against the interests of women's health.  That is very egregious.  When one is a director of a company or hospital, one takes it very seriously.  One has a fiduciary duty to ensure that everything one does is for the benefit of the patients one is serving.  When one is on a board - and I am on a board - everything one does has got to be to the benefit of the patients one serves.  It is wrong to suggest that directors would break their fiduciary duty when we do not even know who they are yet.  That is very unfair.<\/p> <p>  The operating licence from the HSE is another layer which gives us freedom and independence to protect.  Then we have an ownership lease, which is giving us 299 years on the site, and we have a board and the mastership system.  These are all the layers and that is even before I get to explaining that there is no religious ethos at St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's is now a secular hospital under the current board.  Again, people are saying that the current board is some kind of proxy for the religious but this is the very board that spent the last number of years separating the hospital from the church because it wants to emerge into the future as a hospital whose only ethos is delivering the best national and international practice of care for the patients it serves.  This is the very board that has removed a religious ethos.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":601,"content":"<p>That was extremely useful and I thank Dr. Mahony for it.<\/p> <p>   I spoke to the Minister last night about the issue of \"clinically appropriate\" services.

I appreciate why the Minister is saying here and on the airwaves, which is that the approximately eight hospitals that do not provide abortion are HSE-owned.

I think it undermines him as Minister for Health because it seems he cannot get his own State-owned hospitals to provide basic healthcare for women for which he and us campaigned and voted yet he expects us to believe that he or some other Minister with the golden share will be able to intervene in this particular hospital and insist it offers healthcare services that he cannot get hospitals under HSE management to provide.

It is certainly what people have said to me.  I do not think the line is helpful for the Minister in this debate.  The Labour Party position is that we hand over too many projects or State assets to voluntary bodies.  We are moving forward in Ireland.  I appreciate that everyone here is painstakingly explaining to us the different structures, layouts and set-ups but, ultimately, it still seems to boil down to, and this is a public perception, this not being a State-owned building on State-owned lands.  This is the crux of the matter.  People are unable to marry these two things together.  I do not know that we will be able to come out of this committee having married those two things together because I think this is how the public feels and I do not know if a huge amount can be done about that.<\/p> <p>  I find it difficult to follow some of the companies, set-ups, people and complicated lease agreements.  It is company after company and I feel like we are going to end up in the Cayman Islands.  I am trying to follow these things.  This is not in any way to suggest that anything is going to end up there.  It is a complicated thing for members of the public to follow.  Things that are making it difficult to follow include the fact that some pieces of the paper trail may be missing.  Some of the stuff has been drip fed to us.  It has been a bit of a sprint effort to go through the documents released last week.  Two things are missing.  We are bringing the Vatican back into this so forgive me but in respect of the agreement was sought between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity, whatever that agreement or paper trail was, we do not have sight of that.  That is a cause for concern for the public because we do not know what was agreed.   Maybe someone here has seen that but I have not seen it.  People have not seen whatever the conditions of the agreement are.  This land is extremely valuable.  It is a valuable asset.  It is hard for people to believe that the Vatican just went \"there are absolutely no terms and conditions.  You can just do whatever you like with it.\"  If it has said that, it would be really helpful for members of the public to see that paper trail.  <\/p> <p>  Another thing that is a sticking point in public understanding is the fact that what is in the table today is a slightly different agreement to what was touted in 2013.  My understanding is that this change took place around 2017.  It feels as though there was a change in how this would going to look.  We went from public land and public ownership to this agreement.  Has the Minister had sight of or examined the correspondence between the former Minister, Deputy Harris, and his senior officials around 2017 outlining how we got to the current agreement?  Can this be made publicly available because this is something of a sticking point for a lot of people?  <\/p> <p>  There is a question around the issue of indemnity in the share transfer agreement.  I know a couple of legal experts, and I would welcome the Minister's own legal opinion on this, have said that some of these terms of indemnity are perhaps vague and could even cover the Religious Sisters of Charity holding company, RSC Caritas.  Is it correct to say that the indemnity will extend as far as that?  If so, is it appropriate for the State to give that indemnity to it?  <\/p> <p>  What happens if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  We have this layered system.  What is the legal follow on if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  Could the Minister elaborate on who owns what because these are the questions that have come into my inbox?  Who would own what if the Religious Sisters of Charity was to cease to exist within the next 300 years, and we do not know what that will look like?    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#R00400","speaker":"1663"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":610,"content":"<p>The first two questions are around this ask from the Labour Party and others who say they want a State-owned building on State-owned land.  I understand fully why people want that.  The point I was making previously was that this does not provide the guarantee that people may be demanding because when you look at the remaining maternity hospitals or wards that do not provide them, you can see that they are all State-owned hospitals on State-owned land.  By definition, that model does not guarantee what people want.  In fact, it is the voluntary hospitals that have led the way on this.  Regarding the Senator's very reasonable question about why the HSE hospitals are not providing these services, this year, we will have moved from ten to 14 so we are moving quickly in the right direction.  Partly this is because we are directing funding.  I have ring fenced funding for termination services so several hospitals have the money and investment.  We are investing at a level never seen before in maternity services, gynaecology, menopause and endometriosis - a wide variety of areas.  All of this money coming into our services is one of the things helping these hospitals to do it.<\/p><p>The question was about why we cannot get HSE hospitals to provide services.  I respectfully answer that we are doing so.  We are moving from ten to 14 and I intend to move further.  We are all interested in the review of the Act, which we will debate here.  That is another mechanism that we all want to use to identify the final blockages and to get rid of them.<\/p><p> On the matter of having a State-owned building on State-owned land, we will build the building and it will be ours.  We hold the operating licence, appoint three directors and the Minister can intervene at any time to ensure that all services are being provided and that there is no religious influence in the hospital.  The State has strong involvement in this new national maternity hospital that we do not have at all in the current National Maternity Hospital, yet it is a leading hospital.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to decide on the land issue.  I would prefer for us to own the land.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I asked for that.  The position of St. Vincent's from the first day is that this has never been negotiable.  The original agreement was for a 99-year lease, which has moved to 299 years.  The conditions are essentially that we run a healthcare service on it, for &euro;10 a year, which is basically free.<\/p><p> There is a question about whether we could try harder to get St. Vincent's to give us the land.  It would say that it is doing so, for the next 300 years.  We cannot get freehold of the land.  Others have very reasonably asked if there could be a compulsory purchase order for the land.  I asked that of the Department.  The answer is that we could try, but I received legal advice that there would be no guarantee of success, because we would have to prove that it has to be built there and nowhere else in Dublin and that 300 years is not enough for us to have lease ownership for a building with a useful life cycle of 50 or 60 years.<\/p><p> Secondly, this is a partnership.  It would not surprise me if an involved party said we approached it, asked for a partnership and that it gave us the land for 300 years, and that if we are now going to bring it to court, it is not interested in a partnership since that does not feel like a partnership.  It comes down to whether we are willing to move to another site.  Those advocating for it present it as a viable alternative.  Unfortunately, we cannot own the land, but could we build somewhere else?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#R00500","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":612,"content":"<p>Will the Minister answer my question on the indemnity?

The site will have a public hospital, a private hospital, a maternity hospital, general practitioner services, screening services, pharmacies, community-based services and many other services.  For the management of the site as a healthcare campus, there should be single ownership.  Many of the shared services for the entire campus will also be provided at the maternity hospital and university hospital.  We are building shared services for the entire campus as part of the national maternity hospital.  I was recently in Texas Medical Center just outside Houston.  I am told it is the biggest healthcare campus anywhere in the world.  It is a voluntary healthcare campus, with a huge variety of healthcare providers.  Despite that, there is one owner of the campus, which is the Texas Medical Center.  St. Vincent's is applying the same logic here.<\/p> <p>  I am in the realm of speculation now, so forgive me.  All of the debate is about why we should trust St. Vincent's.  People say that it is a fantastic healthcare provider.  There is narrative about whether something is inherently wrong with St. Vincent's, even though it has provided fantastic healthcare for many years.  From St. Vincent's perspective, it has to ask what the long-term motivations of the State are.  It could sell, we could become its freehold owner, then the Government might decide in 70 years that it is done with the maternity hospital, to merge the Coombe and the national maternity hospital, and to build a brand new hospital in Blanchardstown.<\/p><p>St. Vincent's wants this as a healthcare campus for many years to come.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#S01200","speaker":"1623","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":624,"content":"<p>I do not believe anyone is questioning it.

I followed the debate from my office and while here in the committee room.  As it was going on, it struck me that Mother Mary Aikenhead passed away 164 years ago or thereabouts.  She was a physician.  All the way along, we have been debating something that needs to happen.  We need advanced modern healthcare for the women of Ireland.  I do not believe that physician who has now found her eternal reward, or other such people, would want to put any barriers in front of modern healthcare.  If she could somehow communicate to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, I do not believe she would say that it is truly representing her beliefs.  Quality of healthcare is what her life was all about.<\/p> <p>  Like the previous speaker, I will get to asking my set of questions.  Our time is limited.  I have a political question, a legal question and a health question.  My first question is for the Minister.  I am sure he and his advisers have done a hell of a lot of troubleshooting on this.  They have probably modelled different scenarios.  If the Cabinet, the Government and the body politic reject all of this, what is the drawing board to which we will go back that ensures State land, co-location and delivery of a modern hospital in a quick timeframe?  If we go to that other model, what would be the approximate timeframe?  Surely there would be a significant delay.  Have the Minister and his advisers carried out troubleshooting on that and modelled it?  What delays might we face if we all reject what is on offer and go with a plan B that has yet to be even thought of?<\/p> <p>  Are there cessation or break-out clauses, as Senator Hoey asked, if the Sisters of Charity cease to exist?  A modern building built in the 21st century is unlikely to be still standing in 300 years.  It will have to be demolished and rebuilt.  There are surely some break-out and cessation clauses.  I would like to hear about them.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue and Ms O'Sullivan.  There is an unfortunate saying that doctors differ and patients die.  I am sure it is the same in their world as well.  What do they make of the legal advice that was circulated overnight from the Uplift movement?  It is from Stephen Dodd, senior counsel, and relates in particular to the whole compulsory purchase order, CPO, argument.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has repeatedly met politicians and stated there are layers of protection.  A question I have been asked, however, is that if each layer is sufficient, why are there multiple layers of protection, up to and including a golden share?  I ask the Minister to explain to those who are tuned in to these proceedings why there are so many levels of legal protection.<\/p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Mahony and Professor Higgins.  It is a medical question.  Are their fellow obstetricians and gynaecologists currently limited by any religious, legal, political or ideological barriers in terms of delivering a full suite of healthcare procedures, up to and including abortion, in the current National Maternity Hospital?  Are they limited in any way?  They have probably answered my next question already but I will ask it nonetheless.  Do they believe that, going forward, if they do move - lock, stock and barrel - to the new national maternity hospital, any of the legal protections or political agreements that have been hammered out will be impediments to them carrying out their work?  What do they make of what Dr. Boylan has been saying in recent days?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#T00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":628,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I will take his first question, in respect of starting again.  I will pass the question on break clauses and the lease to the lawyers.  Dr. Mahony went through issue of the layers of protection.  We can do so again.  She laid it out very well.  The Deputy also asked another question.  We can come back to it.<\/p> <p>  As regards how long it would take to start again, there is no way to accurately answer that question but my estimate, based on how long it takes the State to build hospitals, is that it would add ten to 15 years to the project.  Some people may say that sounds like a very long time, and it is, but, unfortunately, the State takes a very long time to build hospitals.  We know that from the hospitals in which we are involved.  Would we get another adult hospital to agree to co-locate?  That may be the case.  It may be just a stand-alone maternity hospital.  That would take a very long time.  One must remember that even if we did that and it was a decade on, let us say, and we were discussing a final Cabinet decision on a new hospital, there is no guarantee that we would not be having some version of this debate.  I will be bringing recommendations to the Cabinet in respect of locations for three elective hospitals.  There is debate in respect of where they should go.  All present know there was a big debate in respect of where the children's hospital should go.  No matter what hospital proposal is brought forward to be considered by a government, there always seems to be good and healthy debate because people have different views and they want the right answer.  It would add a very long period to the project.<\/p> <p>  On a human level, the idea of walking across Merrion Square and into Holles Street hospital to tell the clinicians who work there that we had the most exciting and important investment in the future of women's healthcare ready to go but failed to deliver it and we will be back to them in a decade with another site is unthinkable.

The lease is for 299 years.  The only way it can be terminated is if there is a breach by either party.  Basically, the State has to commence construction of the hospital within five years of the date of the lease.  That can be extended by agreement between the parties.  It sets a deadline for shovels to be in the ground and building to start.  We have seen for how long this has gone on so far.  If the State does not do that, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site.  That is not in question.  There would be nothing on it.  To be clear, if the State breaches its obligations during the 299-year term, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site and the building on it.  The obligations on the State are to build a hospital and ensure public healthcare is provided from that hospital.  If it does not do so, St. Vincent's is entitled to take back the site and the building on it.  As the Minister mentioned, if the building is no longer fit for purpose 70 years from now and the State decides it wants to convert it to apartments or to build a shopping centre, St. Vincent's can take back the site and whatever building is on it at the time.

We have to come back a little bit to the history of the Mulvey agreement because the nuns have gone now, they are out of the picture, but in 2016 they were not.  We knew they might be leaving, but we had to create an entity where it did not matter whether the nuns left or not.  We had to create an entity where we had absolute independence in our company.  That is why we have all the layers.  In the initial mediations we were going to be a branch and being a branch does not give you the same protections as being your own separate legal entity, your own separate company.  We had seen from our colleagues in HSE hospitals where maternity services are departments in large acute adult hospitals that there is almost competition for the funding within the hospital and there are different interests in the hospital such as cancer, anaesthetics and all the different specialties.  Very often, it seemed that maternity services were right at the end of the list.  We wanted our own separate funding as well because when you run a hospital, you need to have control of the building, staff and clinical operations, but you also need to have your own separate funding.  In order for us to achieve that, we had to have a separate legal entity.  We went on a bit of a journey during the Mulvey negotiation.  Two mediations had fallen apart because we were in a branch situation.  We could not accept that because we felt it would not give the right governance structure to provide a dedicated healthcare facility for women.  During the Mulvey talks, both St. Vincent's and Holles Street went on a journey, and we had to understand that it is all about patients.  What we are trying to do here is to create an amazing campus that provides care for women, but also care for adults, one that will elevate Irish healthcare and provide care from birth - from a tiny baby born at 23 weeks weighing 500 g - right up to the end of life.  All the research facilities and collaboration between the two hospitals and the doctors is what is at stake here.  When we look at all the successful academic health centres in the world such as Imperial Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital, there is a list of the top 10, and we want to be one of them.  That is what this is about.  We are ambitious for women's healthcare.  We want this hospital to be listed in the top 10.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#U00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":637,"content":"<p>As time is running out, my other question to Dr. Mahony was about any existing barriers for her and her colleagues as they go into work each day.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#U00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>No, there are no barriers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#U00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>Is she saying none whatsoever?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#U00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1652223600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>No, there are no barriers whatsoever to providing termination of pregnancy, tubal ligation, gender affirmation surgery or prescribing contraception.

I apologise for the bells in the background.  I am substituting for Senator Black, who would like to be here herself if she could.<\/p> <p>  We have heard from the Minister that the legal advice is that the expected life of a hospital is 50 years to 60 years.  There is an embodied emissions concern about such a short lifecycle for a building, but we also heard that the requirement is that maternity health services would be continued on this site for 299 years.  This is something important which has not got the necessary focus and it would merit elaboration.  While the rent is currently set at &euro;850,000 per year, which is close to &euro;1 million per year, it is waived to be &euro;10 per year, so long as the permitted use, which is subject to the double constraints of being clinically appropriate and legally permissible, continues.  The Minister tells us the hospital is only to last for 60 years, so what happens after that?  Are we effectively committing to building four or five new maternity hospitals in a row on this site and, if we do not do so, will we become liable for &euro;850,000 or &euro;1 million per year in rent for the site?  It is one or the other.  Either way, both raise significant financial concerns.<\/p> <p>  There has been talk about the many grounds pertaining to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, as the landlord, such that it may be able to seek a forfeiture in relation to the lease, but if the State decides 100 years in that we do want to build a new national maternity hospital that is an actual public hospital - publicly owned on public land - where is our exit and what are the liabilities that would come with such an exit from the lease?  I would like the Minister to comment on those legal issues, and he might also come back on the question of permitted use and the terms \"clinically appropriate\" and \"legally permissible\".

I will give a very practical example of what Dr. Mahony was talking about in the context of having beds and spaces dedicated to women.  I recall working in a general hospital, having just come from working at a maternity hospital where there was a dedicated operating theatre.  One night, a lady presented with ovarian torsion, which is where the ovary cuts off its blood supply, resulting in a major gynaecological emergency.  I was used to working at a hospital where I could bring such a woman straight to theatre after, obviously, asking for her consent because she has autonomy.  I could advise her about the clinical necessity and bring her to theatre.  At the general hospital, I had to go to an operating theatre and advocate for this woman against orthopaedic, general and vascular surgery all looking for the same space.  Ring-fencing, therefore, is incredibly important for women&rsquo;s healthcare which, as the Senator pointed out, was not suitably looked after for many years.<\/p> <p>  The second issue relates to future-proofing.  We earlier gave the example of the Billings method, which is no longer used.  Symphysiotomy was absolutely unacceptable in light of everything we have learned from the women who advocated against it.

They are not perfect and I will, I hope, return to talk to the committee about the issues we have with them, but we can work within them.

Could we purchase it?  In that context, is it the case that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would not support or work with us if we purchased the St. Mary's site, which is adjacent?  I have been very concerned by the idea that somehow it is acceptable for the group to say it will not work with the public hospital but only with a charitable hospital.  Could a hospital on the adjacent St. Mary's site access St. Vincent's hospital very quickly in an emergency?  Would that not be a possible solution?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#V01900","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":676,"content":"<p>Could we provide a note on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#W00150","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Yes, but we are working on the clock-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#W00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":678,"content":"<p>For that reason, we will provide a written response to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#W00300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>Would a written reply satisfy the Senator?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#W00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I would appreciate at least a brief reply on the St. Mary's issue.

That is a service we provide at the moment under the current legislation.  The vast majority of terminations in those cases are provided in the community.  That is where the majority of terminations take place at less than nine weeks.  After nine weeks, we perform these terminations in Holles Street either using medication or using a surgical technique, just because the pregnancy has advanced a bit more and there are more risks of bleeding.  We feel, therefore, that it is safer to perform those procedures in the hospital.  We do not do that many, actually, because the majority of the cases happen in the community, which is totally appropriate.  It is where women can be at home instead of having to come into a hospital.<\/p> <p>  If we look at the experience in Scotland, what we found there was as that service developed and improved, far fewer cases came to hospital because those terminations were being given earlier in the pregnancy when it is safer.  That has been the experience in Scotland and we certainly hope we will follow that.  Even in Holles Street today, we do not perform many procedures under 12 weeks because most are done in the community.  The point about this is that under the legislation, terminations under 12 weeks could be performed in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is no barrier in St Vincent's to performing everything but we have to rationalise services.  At the moment, as regards the kinds of services provided in St. Vincent's hospital, it should be remembered that the hospital has not moved yet so we do all of the routine and normal work, including all of the caesarean sections.<\/p><p>We do approximately two caesarean sections at St. Vincent's per year because we need additional medical backup.  We must remember the hospital has not moved yet.  There is no barrier at St. Vincent's to doing that.

We are not going to cancel a cancer patient just to make a political point that we can do a termination at less than 12 weeks gestation.

The other person might suggest selling his or her house if the person gives him or her a quarter of the big garden.  They would be close neighbours and get on very well so would it not work?  The other neighbour might agree and find it interesting but suggest giving a quarter of the garden for the next 300 years for free.  He or she might say, \"Let's do this, it is exciting\".  The other party may disagree and look to bring the person to the courts, trying to get the garden from him or her, and then believe they will live together in harmony in the two buildings and remain great friends.  The other party would clearly say \"Thanks very much but no\" to the offer.

As I said previously, many people may not know that they own a leasehold interest because there is nothing wrong with a leasehold interest and there is certainly nothing wrong with a long leasehold title.  It is seen as a good and marketable interest in property.  Anyone on the market today who is buying an apartment will buy a leasehold.  If they are selling on their apartment it is selling a leasehold.  Banks take a charge over leaseholds.  There is no problem whatsoever in that regard.<\/p> <p>  With the 299 year lease between St. Vincent's Holdings and the HSE there is a specific agreement within this document that provides that the HSE will not seek to extend the term of the lease or acquire the underlying freehold.  In certain circumstances where money is spent on land or buildings are built, the leasehold owner would have, under the landlord and tenant Acts, a right to acquire the freehold.  It goes back to the fact that this site is specifically being used by the State for the purpose of building a state-of-the-art maternity facility, on foot of a planning permission that was granted in 2017, and not for any other purpose.  There are some restrictions, including that the State will not sell on its interest to a third party.  That is agreed with St. Vincent's.  It wants to operate a public healthcare campus.  In 250 years' time, if the State decided that it no longer wished to carry out public healthcare, it would need to speak to St. Vincent's and hand it back the site.  It is agreed that it will not be seeking to extend the lease, other than by agreement between the parties.  The parties can agree to whatever they want but there is a minimum 299 year period.  The State will not try to use legislative provisions, under the landlord and tenant Acts, to acquire the underlying freehold.<\/p> <p>  I am very satisfied that the interest the State will acquire by way of a 299 year lease is absolutely protecting the State's interest in that building in order to deliver public healthcare facilities in the future.  If it is decided that a maternity facility is no longer required, in 50, 70, 90 or 100 years' time, and if the parties are happy with that, including the new designated activity company, DAC, that is set up, the State can use this site for other public healthcare facilities.  It does not necessarily have to be used as a maternity facility for 299 years.  That does not breach the terms of the lease.<\/p> <p>  I wish to correct a point that was made earlier.  The permitted use in the lease is to provide clinically appropriate and legally permissible services for maternity, but also any other public health care services.  It has been argued that this wording could provide a third party with a way of preventing certain services being provided.  It does not allow St. Vincent's to terminate any property rights or prevent the hospital being used by the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":773,"content":"<p>On the letter of dissent from the two board members, they gave a clear view on the separation of church and State and that it would be better if the State owned the land on which the hospital was built.

The idea that the ownership of the land has anything to do with church influence at this point is simply not true.  The church, the nuns, the priests, the rabbis, the imams: none of them are involved.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular and voluntary healthcare group that we are partnering with.  Whether the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold, whether the national maternity hospital has the freehold, or whether the HSE has the freehold, has nothing to do with the church.  The church is off the pitch completely.  We really owe it to people to keep repeating that and reminding people that the church is gone.  The order is gone and the nuns are gone.  This is a secular healthcare organisation, with both of the groups involved.<\/p> <p>  The Senator made a point about where the governance structure came from.

The legal framework that we are seeing now arises from the heads of agreement that were in the Mulvey agreement.  The Mulvey agreement was a partnership, which was an agreement between three parties: the State, St. Vincent's Hospital, and the national maternity hospital.  We sat down at the beginning of that to see how we were going to deliver this hospital, and how were we going to make sure that we would have a dedicated maternity facility that is totally protected to do all of its services and also protected in relation to budget and operations.  It is not just about termination of pregnancy.  It is about the whole service and having our own funding.  We did not want to be at the end of the line when we were looking for funding in a general hospital setting.  As I said, we had two mediations falling apart because we were going to be a branch.  That really was why we had the Mulvey mediation.  Very early on in that mediation we realised that ethos was not an issue at all and that religion was not a problem.  Actually, as always, the problem was making sure we were not a branch that would be promised ring-fenced funding.  Our colleagues in Cork had had a similar experience when joining a big general hospital and they were told funding would be ring-fenced for them.  It was not so easy for them.  We did not want any ring-fenced funding.  We wanted a proper company structure where we had our own service arrangement and where we had control of our building and control of our staff so we could run our hospital and every aspect of it.  That really was the key of the Mulvey mediation.  As I said, ethos actually was not an issue.<\/p> <p>  On the share transfer, it is important to make the point that when we were negotiating Mulvey, we knew that the nuns were leaving but we also knew that would be a process.  This is also why we made sure that the board of St. Vincent's could have no impact on the operation of the new national maternity Hospital DAC.<\/p><p>To make the point again, St. Vincent's is a totally secular organisation.  The current board has achieved that and it is something of which it is very proud.  It is proud to leave the church behind and to move forward into its future strategically as a hospital that provides great healthcare to its patients.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Rhona Mahony","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":777,"content":"<p>We need to move on, Senator Kyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#AA00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":778,"content":"<p>To reply to the Minister, I am convinced, but the issue is that two members of the board were not convinced.

It has been a gruelling session, so I will keep my questions as concise as possible and remove any commentary.<\/p> <p>  The first is a legal question regarding the proposed 299-year lease.  Under clause 6.5 of the lease, the HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule, which refers to the building covenant, or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Why would the HSE forgo this right so soon into a 299-year lease under this clause?  Should the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group decide to sell the premises, will that open the HSE and this model to an unseen vulnerability?  There may be a simple legal response to that, but it is one of those matters that leaps out to the layperson when trying to digest all these complex documents.<\/p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister.  There is no doubt that this model is bespoke.  Whether one is in favour of it or against it, it is a bespoke model with the golden share element.  If a hypothetical similar arrangement were to come down the line somewhere else and if a future Minister for Health were to ask the current Minister if he would recommend this model to be used again, given his experience, would he recommend it?  I know he has confidence in this particular one but, as a model in the future, would he tell the future Minister to run a mile away from it and to go about it a different way as this was too much trouble legally and politically and that there will always be some concerns and risks inherent in it?  I would appreciate an answer to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022051100002#AA00500","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1652223600,"counter":781,"content":"<p>I will answer first and pass the legal question on.  The golden share in this case is a name but what is important is the legal powers that are attached to it.  There are other golden shares in other situations that may have different legal powers.  Essentially, it means that if for some reason the directors of the NMH fail in their obligations and their duty to ensure all services are provided and are provided without any religious influence, the Minister for Health can direct the board at his or her sole discretion.  It says at the end, for the avoidance of doubt, that the directors must comply with this.

There were legitimate questions and genuine concerns raised here today.  If we had another four hours, we probably would have brought up a lot more questions as well.

People are very busy and they are coming from different backgrounds, so it has been very difficult.  We have not put ourselves in that position.  It is a result of whatever schedule the Minister and the Government are working to.  I think it has been very unfair on the committee the way we have been dealt with.
