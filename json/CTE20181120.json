I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Shane Hamill.  He is the overseas trade manager for Bord Bia.  He manages our Brexit activities and supports. <\/p> <p>  Overall, the value of food and drink exports increased by 13% to &euro;12.6 billion in 2017.  The share of exports destined for the UK declined from 37% in 2016 to 35% in 2017.  However, despite losing share, exports to the UK rose by an estimated 7% in 2017 to some &euro;4.4 billion, despite the ongoing weakness of sterling and the uncertainty created by Brexit.  The change was very much driven by increased demand and strong prices, particularly for dairy and to a lesser extent for beef.  As for year-on-year growth, from the end of quarter 2 in 2018 to date, exports of Irish food and drink to the UK was 2% higher.  Again, the improvement was largely driven by increases in meat and dairy exports, while helped some fall in the exports of seafood and beverages. <\/p> <p>  The value of our exports to other European markets increased from &euro;3.53 billion in 2016 to &euro;4.1 billion in 2017.  Other EU markets now account for approximately one third of total exports.  The value of exports to markets located outside of the European Union increased from &euro;3.49 billion in 2016 to &euro;4 billion in 2017.  International markets now account for 32% of our total trade.  Despite the challenges posed by Brexit, the UK remains the most important market for Irish food and drinks manufacturers.  Exporters remain fully committed to defending our current market share and, where possible, growing business in the UK in the years ahead. <\/p> <p>  The Bord Bia Brexit barometer is a risk diagnostic tool that was designed to assess the individual company level impacts that Brexit can pose.  The Brexit barometer for 2018 was launched on 23 March for six weeks with an aim to measure the progress made by Bord Bia's client companies as they prepare for Brexit.  Key objectives of the exercise were to measure progress across key strategic issues, to identify evolving client priorities and concerns and to further inform Bord Bia's Brexit programmes and supports for its client companies.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 barometer took the form of an online survey, which was completed by 117 client companies that represent almost 50% of the total exports of food and drinks to the UK.  The results demonstrate that the impacts of Brexit vary depending on a number of factors, including the preparedness of individual companies and sector level issues such as export dependency, supply chain complexity and access to inputs.  The barometer also assesses the potential impacts that may be felt by the industry with regard to maintaining customer relationships in the UK, logistical challenges and cost increases arising from customs checks, sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, inspections, the UK landbridge, as well as new export requirements such as documentation and a potential further depreciation of sterling.<\/p> <p>  Bord Bia published the results of the Brexit barometer on 21 June 2018.  The barometer revealed that while 60% of respondents remain uncertain as to the impact of Brexit, 73% of them had made minor or clear progress in preparing for potential outcomes.  The barometer found that 85% of respondents had spoken to key customers in the UK about Brexit in the past 12 months of which 80% had discussed Brexit with customers on two or three occasions.  Of those that have not done so, 42% report that buyers had not indicated a wish to discuss Brexit with them.  In addition, 80% of participants believe they will continue to have opportunities to increase sales to the UK.  The potential strategies for increasing sales to the UK aligned on new product development, enhanced key account management and marketing strategies.  Indeed, 54% of the clients who responded to the barometer now have tailored marketing strategies in place for the UK market, which is up from 39% in 2017.<\/p> <p>  Moreover, 62% of respondents have mapped their supply chains to identify possible challenges arising from Brexit but only 40% have taken steps to reduce supply chain costs.  In the past year we have seen a significant increase in awareness by clients about whether supply chain partners are Brexit-ready.  In 2017, 68% of participants were unsure as to whether their supply chain partners were Brexit-ready but a year later, that level had reduced to 40%.<\/p> <p>  Companies have made modest progress in their understanding of possible customs implications due to Brexit.  Indeed, 45% of respondents believe they have either significant or a reasonable amount of experience in complying with official requirements, while more than 50% of respondents feel comfortable identifying the tariff classifications for their products. <\/p> <p>  More than three quarters of respondents have identified their risk and exposure to currency fluctuations.  They have taken strong action in terms of market diversification, with 85% of respondents actively seeking to expand their business into new markets and 75% of participants have reported a growth in sales to non-EU markets in the past 12 months.  The most attractive growth markets outside of the UK have been in continental Europe, North America and the Middle East. <\/p> <p>  Bord Bia launched a recommendations report in conjunction with the overall findings of the Brexit barometer.  The recommendations report has been disseminated to clients on an ongoing basis and focuses on outlining practical steps that companies can take to become Brexit-ready.   The report also flags Bord Bia and other State supports and contains a template that can help companies to draft their own company-specific Brexit plan.<\/p><p>A benchmark report was also launched and circulated to each respondent outlining how it scores in its preparedness alongside peer companies by turnover, as well as against overall responses.  The objective is to highlight where each individual company should place it focus ,which allows it to target resources in the year ahead into areas that require attention.<\/p><p> Bord Bia has focused on increasing the skills of industry in managing the key pressure points identified through the Brexit barometer around customs, currency risk and supply chain.  Since November 2017, Bord Bia has been running a customs training programme made up of four two-hour sessions for clients.  Each client also receives a two-hour confidential one-on-one mentoring session to work through sensitive commercial information and ensure tailored solutions by company.  More than 50 clients will have availed of this training by the end of the year.<\/p><p> A currency training programme was also launched in November 2017 and has assisted 24 clients to design a treasury policy and foreign exchange strategy.  This helps companies prepare for buyer meetings, tendering and negotiations and will also support existing and new business development.  According to the results of the Brexit barometer, the supply chain is one of the highest risks emerging from the uncertainty around the UK&rsquo;s future status as a trading partner with the EU.  Increased lead times, especially when related to short shelf-life products, in conjunction with a complex and intense supply chain, is a key issue facing the industry.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s supply chain logistics guide helps businesses to optimise supply chain operations by reducing costs and identifying solutions to potential disruptions and identifying the right partners.  The guide is aimed at current and potential exporters who wish to review their logistical operations for servicing both existing and new markets in Europe.  Diversifying into new markets will challenge companies to review their existing supply chain and their logistics channels.  Bord Bia's logistics partner database enables Irish companies to identify logistics service providers operating both in-market at a national level and internationally.  As markets continue to evolve, exporters will need to look beyond their incumbent provider and become more educated in the options available.  The database that Bord Bia has developed focuses on the UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Spain and Poland.  Bord Bia has hosted three supply chain workshops, with a total of 87 companies attending, focused on bringing the recommendations of the logistics guide to life, exploring optimisation opportunities and identifying key performance indicators, KPIs, for logistics partners.<\/p><p> If the export growth trends evident between 2009 and 2017 continue, international markets outside the European Union will account for more than 40% of Irish food and drink exports by 2025.  Global population growth, along with increased urbanisation and affluence, as well as the intensifying challenges of climate change, provide the macro-context for this opportunity.  Bord Bia was commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to undertake an in-depth market prioritisation exercise.  This focuses on identifying relatively new markets that are likely to present growth opportunities over the next five to ten years and on assessing these against the capability of Ireland to supply those markets.  For this reason, strongly established markets, particularly some of the key European markets when it come to meat and dairy, have been excluded from this analysis.  We adopted a funnel approach with an initial screening of over 180 markets using macro-economic and sector-specific criteria to assess and weight on the basis of each category.  This has formed the basis of what we have now in our market prioritisation tool.  The output from the tool initially was to develop a list of the top 30 markets for each category.  Through ongoing consultation with industry and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Bord Bia has identified 15 potential markets for meat, dairy, prepared consumer foods, beverages and seafood.  Some 75 summary reports have been published for each market and sector, outlining the scale of the opportunity, the potential level of competition and any barriers likely to be faced by Irish exporters.  In-depth reports are now being prepared on five of those 15 markets by sector and that will outline how Bord Bia and the industry can leverage what appear to be substantial opportunities.  These outputs will guide Bord Bia&rsquo;s allocation of resources in order to help us work with the industry to deliver on insights, lead generation and in-market promotion, among other areas.<\/p><p> As part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s recruitment campaign for 2018, it is currently in the process of placing 13 additional staff in our overseas offices.  The allocation of these resources was based on the market prioritisation exercise and these market specialists will assist food and drinks companies in market insights, planning and business development.  Four new staff will be placed in Asia, in Singapore, Tokyo and Shanghai; four in Europe: in London, Amsterdam, Dusseldorf and Warsaw; two in the United States; one each in Dubai, Nigeria and North Africa.  To complement that deployment, an additional 13 staff have been recruited to be based in Dublin and will support the international office network from various functions including the insight team, Origin Green and our sectoral teams.<\/p><p> A key part of our activities on an annual basis is Minister-led trade missions and this year they started with a livestock trade mission to Turkey in January, and to the US and Canada in February, both of which were led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  The Minister then led a trade mission to China and Hong Kong in May and to Indonesia and Malaysia just last month.  In addition, Bord Bia hosted Marketplace International 2018 in the RDS on 12 April, which was attended by 532 buyers from 52 different countries across all continents.  In the days before and after the event, some 290 buyers participated on 28 bespoke itineraries visiting 61 producers and 20 retail and food service sites.  We have been actively following up on these leads to see how we can convert what are good prospects into real business opportunities for Bord Bia clients.<\/p><p> On stakeholder engagement, Bord Bia continues to play a leading role in the various Irish Government and industry fora to provide market and customer insight to policy makers and to prioritise support services and opportunities for Irish food and drink manufacturers.  Bord Bia has held a number of meetings with Irish and UK customers to present the findings of the Brexit Barometer 2018 and to outline the preparedness of the Irish supply base.  These meetings have been used as an occasion to assess the potential opportunities that can arise for Irish food and drink manufacturers post Brexit.  A series of meetings also has been held with logistics operators to better understand the challenges that may arise from the supply chain as a result of Brexit and to feed back the expectations of food and drinks manufacturers on the sector.<\/p><p> In July 2018, Bord Bia launched Plan to Grow, which is a way of working more closely with individual clients to help them develop and implement their own marketing strategy.  This is the first time Bord Bia has launched a bespoke end-to-end service of this scale.  This service will be central to helping seize emerging opportunities that have arisen in emerging markets, for example in China, with the opening of the beef market there in April, while also helping client companies to address the challenges being faced by their business.<\/p><p> I hope this presentation has given members of the committee a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by the food and drinks sectors as a result of Brexit, their level of preparedness, as well as, hopefully, a good understanding of the actions being taken by Bord Bia on behalf of our client companies.<\/p><p>Mr. Hamill and I will be happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan for a very comprehensive update on where we are at present.

It is just what one would expect from Bord Bia.  I had the pleasure to be on the board of Bord Bia for six years and it is an organisation that does its work very professionally and diligently.  This report shows its preparedness, what it is putting in place for Brexit, as well as the implications it can have for this country.  Unfortunately we are dealing with a lot of variables at present and we do not know what the deal will be.  From Bord Bia's point of view, all it can do is what it is already doing, and to try and get companies prepared for the worst and most doomsday-like scenario one can imagine, which is a no-deal Brexit and the problems that will bring to our shores.  Bord Bia has covered and closed off a lot of the dangers and pitfalls by preparing companies as much as it possibly can for it.  Hopefully, we will not get into that scenario.<\/p> <p>  What happens when standards begin to vary between the two countries?  At the moment one has rigid standards that are operable both here and in the UK.  If standards start to vary along with currency fluctuations, I refer to the damage that will do to trade and how difficult that will make things.  We saw the pressure our mushroom industry came under when the first talk of Brexit broke.  Currency fluctuations will be a huge issue under that scenario.<\/p><p>There is one issue on which I do not see anyone focusing very much.  It is the case of other countries that engage in significant trade with the United Kingdom and what will happen when they have their products displaced  For example, the Dutch engage in a serious amount of trade.  Their agrifood trade figure with the United Kingdom is 15% higher than ours.  If there is a no-deal Brexit, they are also going to be looking for new markets and competing with us on the same playing field.  That is one aspect on which I have not seen too much of a focus, namely, that the Dutch, the Danes and the Poles will all lose market share in the United Kingdom.  On what markets will they focus post-Brexit? <\/p><p> We are down to a figure of 48% of our beef going to the United Kingdom.  Realistically, it would be desirable to get it down by another 7% or 8%, which is going to be a serious job.  For a good number of years we have been working to diversify markets.  The United Kingdom has always been our best paying market.  The beef industry is in serious bother.  There is a kill rate of 40,000 head and returns to the primary producer are at a very low ebb.  What are we going to do with all of that beef and what possible markets can we find for it?  We have seen live exports grind to a halt in the last couple of months.  Turkey was seen as the great white hope, but owing to problems with its currency, there are no cattle going there, which is putting a lot of pressure on the system.  <\/p><p> Bord Bia has talked about the additional staff it has employed.  In the last two budgets there have been extra resources for it.  I will ask Mr. Brennan an awkward question, but it is in the context of a no-deal Brexit.  How much extra could be used by Bord Bia?  Establishing new markets is not something that happens overnight with the flick of a switch; it is a slow process.  Is giving Bord Bia an extra &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million realistic in the context of what it needs to diversify markets, given the huge volume of products we export to the United Kingdom?  We will just not find a home anywhere else for the quantity of cheddar cheese going to the United Kingdom.  Where can we go with that product?  It might be difficult for Mr. Brennan to give a definite answer, but exactly how much extra in terms of resources could Bord Bia use to successfully establish new markets?<\/p><p> I want to ask about Food Wise 2025 and the targets set in it.  We have the Mercorsur and other threatened trade deals.  Having regard to the serious emphasis being put on the need to tackle climate change, does Mr. Brennan believe the Food Wise and Food Harvest 2020 targets need to be revisited?  We are hitting a lot of them and people are surprised by the rapid expansion on the dairy side which has exceeded even the wildest expectations.  Are the targets set in the interests of primary producers?  Last night I attended a meeting in Mallow, at which it was indicated that the figures by which we had increased production were great, but, unfortunately, the incomes of primary producers have moved in the other direction.  If we produce all of the product by 2025, will it be possible to have it marketed that will give a return to the primary producer because that is definitely not the case at present?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#E00300","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan and his colleagues for their presentation.  In the time of Aidan Cotter and many others, like Deputy Cahill, I always found Bord Bia to be an excellent organisation.  Thankfully, we have always championed the call for additional resources which it has always repaid in spades in its efforts and marketing skills in related areas.<\/p> <p>  Market diversification is the key.  Even if we were not hit by the threat of Brexit, it is incumbent on us to secure new markets for different products and to meet consumer preferences and everything else.  It is absolutely critical that we do this and to see how we might be in a position to supply various markets.  The disruption likely to be caused is something to which we have to pay particular attention.  <\/p> <p>  Has Bord Bia identified the key parameters associated with the quality production in which we engage, particularly in the context of the emphasis placed on the need for people to see our product as being green grass-fed?  Is that gaining any traction in identifying the new markets referred to?  What is the likely degree of penetration in those markets as a result of what we have to offer?  Are there improvements we can make or are we just fooling ourselves?  The Food Wise 2025 targets are great, but, as in the case of every organisation, the representatives of which come here, if anyone tells us or indicates that we should stall the horse, he or she is looked upon as a Luddite and castigated, even non-verbally and the frown says it all.  However, there is no point in having a glut of products and produce if we do not have markets for them.  We have only defined and very limited markets.  Up to nine of every ten animals we produce are exported in some shape or form.  Likewise, for cheddar cheese, we are close to having one market for our product.  These are the challenges.  We should also be very clear and succinct in informing the producing public - farmers - that there may well be pitfalls ahead and that they should not allow themselves to go down the wrong road.  It is all about finding new export markets for existing products and trying to have reopened some of the ones that were closed off.  I am aware that Bord Bia is working on the issue and they potentially sound very attractive.<\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of developing new lines or products to substitute for the loss of the market share in the United Kingdom.  Sterling has strengthened again in the last week or so, but, of course, the exchange rate is up and down.  It has become an oscillating currency as a result of the events occurring within the British Government.  How does Bord Bia suggest we deal with the issue?  With such a preponderance of products that go to the United Kingdom, how does Bord Bia see us getting our products to other markets if we win them because, as we know, the United Kingdom is a significant bridgehead?  I am aware that new seafaring routes are being opened up and that we are making our own way and developing alternatives to travelling through Great Britain.  Nevertheless, it is still a significant bridgehead which will be important.  Is Bord Bia planning its alternative strategies on the basis that there will be a no-deal Brexit or is it considering the full panoply of potential outcomes to see how things might progress in that regard?  <\/p> <p>  I am aware that next year Bord Bia will employ a number of people, including graduates, to play the roles it requires to play to facilitate the various sectors as they transit into the post-Brexit economic environment, especially after March 2019.  I still have a strong feeling that in ten years' time we will be talking about this issue.  It took Greenland three years to get out of the European Union and it had only had a few agreements here and there.  In this instance, we are dealing with a very large country with a population of 60 odd million people and thousands of interlocking agreements. It is going to be a long haul.<\/p><p>That is why I think we will be allocating resources to Bord Bia and other advisory and marketing bodies for a long time to come and I hope they will continue their good work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#F00200","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I will go back to Mr. Brennan after we have heard from Senator Conway-Walsh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#G00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan for his presentation.

Will the delegates give us a breakdown of how much of the funding for the marketing assistance and step change programmes has been spent this year?  Would it be possible for them to provide a regional breakdown in that regard?  Can moneys from the Brexit funding be made available to new businesses that might be in the process of setting up?

His first question was related to standards.  It has been very clear in all of our interactions and discussions with customers in the United Kingdom that they have absolutely no interest in seeing standards slip at any stage.  Likewise, it is clear from the consumer work we have done that consumers are strongly in favour of the retention of the levels of standards in the market.  That is the basis at which we are looking.  It will be a key concern for us when the final shape of any Brexit agreement becomes apparent.  As an industry, we try to work on a level playing field at all times.  Standards represent a key element of that level playing field.  We believe that if there is the potential for competitors who offer lower prices to come into the UK market with what we would consider to be lower standards, it could do a lot of damage to the market.  This is recognised in the retail and food service sectors in the United Kingdom.  There is a strong desire not to upset the level of consumer trust in the market.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill also asked about other suppliers to the United Kingdom, particularly in the Netherlands.  The key element for us is looking at how we can diversify in markets outside Europe.  That was our purpose in undertaking our market diversification exercise.  In a worst case scenario all of the produce that has gone to the United Kingdom up to now will end up on the Continent of Europe after Brexit.  That is the last thing any of us wants to do because it would be detrimental to everybody who supplies the European market.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from an examination of global demographics that growth in global demand for food is primarily being led in Asia, the Middle East and, to a lesser extent, North America.  It is all about identifying the markets that offer the best potential for growth in international markets.  We are putting additional people on the ground in these markets - China, the rest of South-East Asia, the Middle East and North America - and investing our own resources in local market expertise.  As the Deputy said, this can take a lot of time, but we are looking at the best ways to hasten the development of our understanding of the markets into which we are looking to diversify.  We have our own thinking house facility that works on consumer and marketing insights.  We are investing heavily in these new potential markets and need people with their boots on the ground.  In addition to our existing or additional staff, we need to access local expertise.  We will invest heavily in this area.  Even if we are successful in overcoming the challenges that will present in most of these markets in the event of a harder Brexit, Ireland will remain a relatively small supplier in many of them.  I know that the beef side is not directly comparable, but it is worth mentioning that China currently imports 700,000 tonnes of beef each year and it is predicted that this figure will double in the next three or four years.  Likewise, we are looking at double digit growth in dairy imports demand on an annual basis.  For us, it is about identifying the right niche opportunities for us in these markets.  We need to realise that in a worst case scenario we will have to compete with other European suppliers.  We need to get our credentials and see where we can win in these markets.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Cahill, rightly, highlighted to the importance of the United Kingdom for the beef industry.  It continues to take almost half of our beef each year.  There is no point in denying that in the event of a hard Brexit, it will be really challenging to displace that amount of product from the United Kingdom and into other markets, particularly because the United Kingdom is the beef market with the highest prices in the world.  It is probably the market that we have the longest tradition of servicing.  It is also the closest market to us and the returns from it tend to be better than those from many others we have.  We will focus on the Continent of Europe.  We have made a great deal of progress in recent  years in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Italy where we hope there will be scope for some further increases.  We will certainly have to look to international markets to try to offset some of the real pressure being felt.  We hope the key customers for Irish beef in the United Kingdom will continue to want to source beef from here and that is certainly the impression we are getting from them.  They know that it is a quality product and are aware of its sustainability credentials.  They want to continue the relationship we have with them.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about additional staff.  We have taken on 26 or 27 extra staff during the course of 2018.  That might not sound very significant in the overall scheme of things, but from Bord Bia's point of view, it represents an increase of more than one quarter on the staffing levels we had up to this year.  Our resources have increased significantly.  It is really important that we are investing in putting people on the ground in the markets in the various regions about which we are talking.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the various options that might be available to export cheddar cheese.  A level of diversification away from the United Kingdom has already been seen in the dairy industry.  It used to be the case that over 60% of our cheddar went to the United Kingdom, but that figure has decreased to 52% or 53%.  I know from our various trade missions that the industry has been looking at markets such as Japan and South Korea as options for cheddar cheese exports.  There is a growing demand for cheese in countries such as China.  They might not necessarily want to buy cheddar now, but there may be opportunities in the food service sector in markets such as China in the future.  It would certainly be a big challenge.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the level of resources we might need.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine conditioned us to focus on undertaking the market prioritisation exercise.  It shows that there is a level of co-ordination as we proceed, as more clarity on the final shape of any agreement emerges, as we seek to identify which markets offer the best potential and which markets in we should invest more.  We will be keeping all of these issues under review as we proceed in the coming months.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Food Wise 2025.  The industry's ambition is to achieve &euro;19 billion worth of food and drink exports within the next eight years.  That has always been seen as an ambitious challenge.  I think it was deliberately set as an ambitious challenge for the industry.  I know from talking to representatives of various sectors and client companies that they are still determined to try to achieve the &euro;19 billion target, but we really need to target the markets and segments of markets in we are trying to do business.  That brings me back to the Deputy's question about what all of this means for primary producers.  We are also required to be even stronger in the credentials we offer in these markets.<\/p><p>Traditionally we have sold Ireland on its clean, green and natural reputation, which is strong.  The perception of Ireland in the international marketplace is it is strong in those areas.  Increasingly, there is a requirement for us to quantify those claims and to provide more data, facts and figures to back-up and verify the claims on an ongoing basis.  For example, through the sustainable dairy assurance and sustainable beef and lamb schemes, we provide the data that reassures and gives customers the ammunition to build a proposition for why they source Irish meat or dairy products.  It is something we are investing in.  Grass-fed product is one of our key strengths.  We have just completed in-depth research across 13 markets in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America looking at grass-fed products at a customer and consumer level.  There is no doubt that grass-fed products are a motivator for both customers and consumers.  Globally, approximately half the consumers we spoke to said whether a product was grass-fed would influence their purchasing decisions, particularly of dairy.  In Europe, it was two thirds of the consumers we spoke to.  There is an opportunity for Ireland to own that space but to do so, we have to have a clear, quantifiable standard in place to show why grass-fed makes sense for us.  If we can establish those sort of positions - the Deputy is correct that it takes time - it gives us the best opportunity to extract the best value out of the market and ultimately give the best return to the primary producer.  <\/p><p> Regarding what we are trying to do in diversification, we have established what we call our global relationship team.  A number of our customers are global, multinational operators.  Up to now we have been dealing with them individually in different countries.  Ms Karen Coyle is heading up the team in Bord Bia to try to bring a centralised approach to how we work at a global headquarters level and to build the awareness and reputation of Ireland at headquarters level and not just on a country-by-country basis.  It is all about positioning Ireland in the right way in terms of its capabilities and credentials as a food producing country.  <\/p><p> We are all well aware of the sterling challenge to the industry over the past two and a half years.  As part of the Brexit barometer, we assessed the exchange rate at which client companies would get into severe difficulties.  If one went back to 2017, when we talked about an exchange rate of &euro;1 being equal to between 90p and 94p sterling, it meant that more than 80% of companies would be in severe difficulties.  A year later that figure is 55%.  It is a decrease but still a worrying figure.  Companies have taken steps in respect of currency risk management and efficiency gains within their supply chains to try to offset some of that.  We find currency risk training is a good way of engaging with clients on a one-to-one basis regarding what they can do in their businesses.  There is no point in saying otherwise - sterling continues to be a major challenge for the industry.  <\/p><p> Getting product to other markets is a particular challenge.  One member asked how we are preparing.  We are preparing on the basis of the worst-case scenario and trying to get our supports and programmes in place to help companies prepare for that.  Like everybody around this table, we are hoping it will not come to pass but it is the basis for our planning.  Alternative routes are available to get products to other markets.  The issue is time delays and their cost implications.  They could be significant depending on the product.  If we get into shorter shelf life products, it can also be a major challenge for us.  Through our customs and supply chain services and supports, we are breaking it down for the client companies we work with.  <\/p><p> Senator Conway-Walsh asked if we are engaging with partners in the UK.  From the outset, we felt the key for us in the UK market was to engage in maintaining and building relationships.  Our first port of call was retail and food service customers that had been sourcing from Ireland on a longstanding basis.  This year alone, we had 70 meetings with retailers and food service companies in the UK.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I was referring to engagement in the context of opposing a hard Brexit and them using their influence similarly to organisations in the North.

As a semi-State agency, we cannot lobby directly.<\/p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Hamill to comment on transactions and suppliers after Brexit shortly.  The implications for tariffs depend on whether the UK leaves the customs union and the shape of any trading agreement.  If we take beef as an example, which is one of the key products we send to the UK, we could be looking at tariff rates of between 28% and 53%.  For beef, we could be looking at a 12.8% tariff and &euro;3,000 per tonne of a duty.  It could be &euro;1,700 for cheddar cheese.  These are all WTO worst-case scenario tariffs.  With lamb, it could be a 12.8% tariff in addition to &euro;1,700 of a duty.  Different tariff regimes exist.  The European Economic Area is at the lower end of those tariffs.  The figures I have given are the worst-case scenario figures in terms of WTO tariffs.

In recent months, we have met five of the retailers in the Irish market and have been working with them.  They are trying to map out their existing supply chains and the sources of the various products that they have on their shelves or are selling through their food service outlets.  They are then trying to determine the implications of various scenarios for their supply chains.

We are showing people what it takes to fill out a customs single administrative document, SAD, and an export declaration, what customs agents will help them do so, and how much customs agents will charge.  In the customs assistance market and depending on who is being asked, it could be anything from &euro;25 to &euro;50 to help with an SAD.  We also address the associated veterinary inspections.  When a product lands in the UK, customs are handled by one group of officials while sanitary and phytosanitary standards, SPS, and veterinary checks are handled by another.  We talk to people about the costs associated with those processes.  This is a complex methodology and depends on the type of product being moved, how large the consignment is and so on.

Currency, and how the markets read it, may be the key determinant of how Brexit works out for us, be that good, bad or indifferent.  Anyone who supplies into the UK is vulnerable, as evidenced by the case of the mushroom suppliers Deputy Cahill mentioned.  Following the referendum when sterling nosedived and our mushroom suppliers were tied into fixed-term annual or biannual contracts with sterling prices, there was little sympathy from their customers.

In recent weeks, the price that farmers are getting from the factories is down 30 cent per kilo.  Farmers were getting &euro;4.05 last year but are only getting &euro;3.75 now and I believe the price has fallen by a further 5 cent in the past week.  Despite the assertion that there are no cartels and that there is no evidence of same, prices in all of the factories throughout the country are similar.  Clearly this is unsustainable.  Teagasc stated that it costs &euro;800 per year to keep a suckler cow but farmers are only being paid &euro;700 for a weanling from the factories.  There is a glut of cattle at the moment.  Last week, a record 40,000 animals were killed in the factories.  How long can this go on if farmers are losing money?  They will go to the wall.  I know this is primarily an issue for the meat factories but Bord Bia and the Minister travel abroad, create markets successfully and the factories benefit from that.  What will be done to bring pressure to bear on the factories?  Is Bord Bia participating in the beef forum?  What is the status of that forum?  Are factories being challenged by Bord Bia?  If we do not have beef and suckler farmers, there will be no beef to be sold abroad and I am concerned about this.<\/p><p>Another issue is the size of the national herd, which is also having an impact on farmers.  The herd size is constantly being challenged, especially in the context of the climate change debate.  Farmers are struggling and I would like much more done to be for them.  If more is not done, we will not have a beef industry in the future or, at the very least, we will have a diminished industry.  They will just fall away because, as we have said here so many times, it is not attractive for young farmers when they have so many other options.  Why would they go into an enterprise where they will lose money?  That is consistently happening and it is not getting any better.  What is Bord Bia doing about this issue?  What pressure is it bringing to bear?  The factories need to be called to account.  Those who ask questions should not just be pointed in the direction of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Bord Bia is helping the factories and there should be a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#K00500","speaker":"1425"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I will start with Senator Daly's questions.  He is correct regarding the high levels of currency exposure.  Half our meat, 65% of our prepared consumer foods and more than half of all of our cheddar cheese goes to the UK.  Currency pressures have been, and continue to be, a major challenge for the industry. There is a realisation that suppliers into the UK market are facing currency pressure.  That is recognised by both the suppliers and their UK customers.  There was food price inflation in the UK for the first time in many years over the past year and a half.  That resulted in higher prices being paid to retailers and our understanding is that this reflected itself back in some of the contracts that were being signed.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the potential at the end of March next year for lots of contracts to close, it is our understanding that some customers in the UK are inserting breakout clauses into contracts that they have with Irish suppliers.  I do not say that business will be lost but it is recognising the reality that there could be a significant change at the end of March next year.  Businesses are allowing for a reopening of contracts after that date.  We have seen that phenomenon emerging in the past six months in particular.  One can look at that in two ways but at least there is a realisation that there could be a need to review existing contracts.  <\/p> <p>  On stockpiling, the trade data we have seen does not suggest that there are significant levels of stockpiling happening in the UK.<\/p><p>It is shelf life dependent.  The Senator referred to the fact that some products are more suitable for stockpiling than others.  Our view and information at this stage is that one would not expect a major level of stockpiling in the next while, but it is something we have to keep under review because as he correctly pointed out, it could have a knock-on consequence on the level of trade as we go through 2019.<\/p><p> In the trade deals in new and emerging markets that have been coming through in recent years, the focus of the ministerial-led trade missions is the level of access that we have to these markets.  I refer to the detail of the access that we have on specifications such as age, bone-in and boneless meat products.  Based on contacts with our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I know there continues to be a focus on getting the broadest access we can get.  At least then one has more options within the market in terms of what type of product one can supply to different customers in that market.  The deals that are done are, typically, at a commercial level, between a supplier and a customer.  In any commercial arrangement like that, it is up to the individual arrangement rather than there being a long-term agreement in place.  In the markets where there is an increasing import requirement because of a deficit the volume of food produced locally versus the need for imports, no more than in the UK, the onus is on us as a sector and Bord Bia is a key part of that in making clear why Ireland should be the source of the product rather than elsewhere.  We outline the quality, health and natural credentials that make us stand out as a supplier into those markets.  Each market will always be competitive in nature.  Every market is competitive and, therefore, we have to be as strong as we can be in how we position ourselves in those markets.<\/p><p> As to whether we are on track with the Food Wise 2025 targets, if one extrapolates out to 2025 from where we are currently in terms of the growth in exports of food and drink products in recent years, we are just about on target.  To return to the point that was raised by Deputy Cahill and Senator Mulherin about being in sync at primary producer level as well, the challenge is how we position ourselves in these markets and where we get the value from them.  We must look at what return we can get from different markets for the different products that we produce.  That is the greatest challenge overall as the marketing promotion agency for food and drink in terms of finding opportunities.  Some of those take time to secure and to develop a position.  Everything we do is about where we can position an Irish food and drink product in a market at a particular time to get the best return.  Sometimes one has to get into a market and establish oneself and over time gradually work one's way up in terms of the level of return one can get from the market.  That is the emphasis of our role in trying to ensure the maximum return from the marketplace.<\/p><p> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy asked about seafood and why our exports were down in the UK.  A couple of factors are at play.  There has been a significant change in the market distribution of Irish seafood in recent years.  The Asian region, in particular, has emerged strongly for products that traditionally might have gone to the UK or various parts of continental Europe and, therefore, it is more a reflection of other markets elsewhere perhaps giving a better return rather than being due to any fundamental issue in the UK market itself.<\/p><p> The Deputy correctly asked about the Brexit barometer and the template and if we are tracking whether companies are using it.  I am involved in a sectoral team and we have regular meetings with our client companies as part of that.  In our engagement with them at those meetings, we assess where they are in their preparation for Brexit.  We walk them through the template and other supports that we have to make sure they are as prepared as they can be.  Through our various workshops and training programmes, Mr. Hamill encourages more companies to take part.  I should have referenced earlier that all our training programmes and workshops are oversubscribed at the moment.  We will continue to run those programmes and workshops until such time as there is no longer a demand for them.  That gives a good indication of how tuned in companies are and the emphasis that is being placed by our client companies on getting ready at this stage.<\/p><p> On market prioritisation, we examined five different categories, namely, meat, dairy, prepared consumer foods, seafood and beverages.  A total of 15 different markets have been identified for each.  On the meat and dairy side, we deliberately excluded many of the European markets from the top 15, not because they are not a priority for us - they are core markets for us - but they are markets where in most cases we are well established.  We focused on new markets.  For meat, for example, eight of the 15 are in Asia while in dairy and seafood seven of them are in Asia.  There are a number of Middle Eastern countries.  For example, the United Arab Emirates is strong in a number of categories.  North America - the US and Canada - is also strong, as is Mexico across a number of categories.  In the area of prepared consumer foods where the industry has traditionally been strong in the UK, seven of the 15 on the list are continental European market.  The markets vary a little depending on the category.<\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about the new staff in Nigeria and North Africa.  The person going to Nigeria will cover the west Africa region in general.  The primary focus will be dairy, followed by seafood.  It is a significant region for seafood exports as well.  For North Africa we are looking at dairy, potentially on the livestock side and to a lesser extent on the meat side.  They are the areas we are looking at in terms of new staff going into those regions.<\/p><p> On the plan to grow services and which clients they are available to, essentially any company that is engaging with us and working with us to develop their commercial marketing strategy can avail of the plan.  Some services will be more appropriate to different clients than others but they are available to any client company.<\/p><p> Senator Mulherin was very hard on us altogether.  However, I accept that it is a serious issue.  I am from Kilkenny and I live on a beef farm, so I know exactly the challenges she is talking about.  We have been in a difficult period for beef prices for some time.  There is no doubt when one looks at the profitability figures, which the Senator rightly pointed out Teagasc and others have been releasing and publishing recently, that we have a major viability challenge at farm level.  It is a serious challenge for us.  At its simplest, what Bord Bia is trying to do on beef is find the best customers in the best markets to buy as much Irish beef as we can.  That is reflected in the fact that if one looks at where Irish cattle prices are relative to European cattle prices - while I stand to be corrected - on a year-to-date basis, we are in or around 105% of the European average price for cattle this year.  We are below the UK price but that is by far and away the highest price.  Almost all UK beef stays within the UK market.  Half our beef goes to the UK and half goes outside the UK to other European markets and elsewhere.  The challenge has been to get a return from the marketplace because there has been an increase in supply across the continent and that has had a detrimental effect on demand for beef in general, which has put pressure on prices.  It highlights the challenge for the industry and points towards looking for new markets more so than ever before, to create competition for our product by having as many markets as can possibly have available to us that are willing to buy different cuts of beef from Ireland to maximise the return that we can get.  It is not an easy issue to solve.  The onus is on Bord Bia to market and promote Irish beef in different markets, and that will continue to be the case in order that we can establish it and sell it in the various markets.<\/p><p>The fact we go into every market as an import supplier and typically there is a preference for locally produced products puts us at a disadvantage from the get go.  We try to find a niche or a part of the market where we feel we can establish ourselves and get the maximum value.  We cannot achieve that in every market but it is the ambition we have and what we work towards.  For us it comes back to what are the unique credentials of Irish beef, what makes it different and how do we stand out, and then selling these as strongly as we can.  My brother and my neighbours would like the price to be much better than it is but that is the focus of what we are trying to do.  We are in a European beef market where prices can be volatile and where they have been under pressure for a period of time.  We are trying to find the best return we can from the investments we make in promotional activities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraig Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>We could have quite an extensive conversation on this but I asked Mr. Brennan how the meat factories have been challenged by authorities here.

We appreciate members' time and interest.  I will summarise my opening statement due to time constraints.  I am sure everybody wants to get on with their evening.  I am a producer, seller and trainer of showjumping horses.  I am based in Malahide, County Dublin, and have a stable of 20 horses.  I have eight staff.  I mentor young riders.  I have lectured at NUI Maynooth on occasion.  I run training programmes for Teagasc young breeders and the Showjumping Association of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am accompanied by Mr. Greg Broderick from Tipperary.  He is an Olympian and a breeder and producer of horses.   I am also joined by Mr. Ger O'Neill from Kilkenny.  He is also a breeder and producer.  He produced and rode two of the gold medal winners at the recent world championships for young horses in Lanaken, Belgium.  I am also accompanied by Mr. Jim Power, whom I believe is well known to members.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Sport Horse Alliance is a voluntary body comprising a group of businesses, individuals and sports bodies directly involved in the sports horse industry.  The sport horse is anything other than a thoroughbred.  The sector is driven mainly by eventing, showjumping and dressage - mainly by the Olympic disciplines.  That is where most of the professional economic activity is.<\/p> <p>  Our group represents 3,000 jobs because our members include breeders, producers, trainers, owners, vets, blacksmiths, feed companies and equipment companies.  Most of the major companies in Ireland are members and contributors to our alliance.  Our goal is to sustain an increase in jobs, exports and inward investment in the sector and to grow the sector.  We believe there is potential to double our output in jobs, exports and inward investment.  We are not here to look for any subsidies, price supports or tax breaks.  We will look after the price of our product.  We just want investment from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p> <p>  We are here to present our report.  When we came together as a body two years ago, we found there were numerous reports on our industry, amounting to four or five over the past 15 years, but none had definitive information on the contribution of the sport horse sector or, indeed, its potential.  Therefore, we commissioned Mr. Jim Power to produce an economic report on our industry.  It has been circulated among members and he will elaborate on it.  His remit was to inform public policy-makers of the economic footprint of the sector and identify measures that can be taken to unlock its potential.<\/p> <p>  The stand-out point in the report is that the industry is worth &euro;816 million to the Exchequer and employs 14,000 plus.  We did not make up those figures.  They come from a UCD report, which was commissioned independently.  They are not from any sport or breeding body or from us.  They are altogether independent of our group.  Another stand-out point in the report is that each horse results in average expenditure of &euro;7,000 per year in the local economy.  I refer to expenditure through vets, blacksmiths, feed, forage, bedding, subscriptions, travel, equipment and training.  The report also states there are 20,000 active sport horses in Ireland, which means &euro;140 million invested in the rural economy.  That is outside the M50 in all the rural constituencies from Dingle to Donegal.  In my stable alone &ndash; I am based in County Dublin &ndash; the feed comes from Kilkenny and the bedding from Ballina.  My vet is from Kildare and my blacksmith is from Meath.  I do shows around the country and my hay and any straw I use come from County Carlow.  Those in the industry spend right around the country, benefitting every village and rural area.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of good news in our sector.  We are not here to complain and whine.  In the past 18 months in the sport alone, we became the European senior gold medal winners.  This happened in Sweden.  At the world championships in Atlanta, America, this year, we were the silver team medal eventers.  We had an individual silver there.  We were the gold medal individual winners at the under-14 and under-18 competitions in Fontainebleau in France, with one competitor riding Mr. Ger O'Neill's horses.  We are second in the world breeding statistics for eventing horses.  Therefore, our island produces the second best eventing horses for export all around the world.  We won three medals this year at the world breeding championships for young horses in Lanaken, Belgium.  This is against all the other breeds from areas that are way stronger than us in terms of investment and numbers.  <\/p> <p>  In our report, we envisage that we need &euro;100 million in investment over the next five years to sustain our employment level, double it and increase our worth to the Exchequer.  As a group of businesspeople, we realise the realties of budgetary allocations owing to a series of competing demands.  I have watched a few of the reviews of people coming in here giving presentations and I realise everybody is looking for money at the same time.<\/p> <p>  Brexit will have a serious effect on the lower end of our market because England takes approximately 40% of our exports.  The movement of horses is worrying for us because any slowdown in the movement of horses is where much of the expense arises.  If the product is easier to get in Europe, those concerned will get it there instead.<\/p> <p>  We ask for &euro;100 million as a group over five years.  That is the figure we produced in the Jim Power report.  Horse Sport Ireland put in a budget submission to the Government asking for &euro;30 million.  It wanted to spend it over the four new departments: high-performance sports; sports and recreation; breeding and production; and coaching, education and training.  Unfortunately, in the budget we got an extra &euro;500,000, which brings our annual funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to &euro;3 million.<\/p><p>That is completely inadequate.  I do not know how people think we can sustain 14,000 jobs and grow the economy with that level of funding.  I cannot see the thinking behind it at all.  That is one of the requests we have today.  If our potential is to be realised, it is critical that realistic multi-annual funding is established so that we are not coming back every year and wondering what we are going to do next year, what programmes we can open and can sustain and what we can do over the next couple of years.<\/p><p> We have written to the Minister, Deputy Creed, to ask him to establish a high-level group to identify and secure sustainable funding streams for our sector.  Without such an initiative the sector will have a high level of ambition, but no growth.  With the committee's permission, my colleagues will now give a brief synopsis of what they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#O00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":87,"content":"<p>My stable is based in Thurles in County Tipperary.  I am an international showjumper and spend approximately half of my time in Ireland and half in Europe at international shows.  That is because of the unfortunate lack of facilities to compete at international shows in Ireland.  To give a comparative statistic, when I was an under-21 rider at the European championships in Athens in 2006, there were five riders on the under-21 team and another five on the under-18 team.  From those ten riders, I am the only one left in the business in Ireland.  All the others have left and set up in England, mainland Europe and America.  That is mainly because the facilities in Ireland are not up to scratch and it is hard to produce horses to a top level.  It is a very upsetting statistic to think that all of my colleagues when I was a young rider have had to move away.<\/p> <p>  In total, I have 18 full-time and five or six part-time staff and 70 horses riding out every day in my stable.  We breed up to about 40 foals every year, have about 250 horses on the farm and, like Mr. O'Connor, all our investment is in Ireland.  I mention hay, straw, feed and farriers.  I love being based at home in Ireland.  Unless things improve, however, when we are putting so many young horses on the ground - if we do not have better shows, prize money, and, most importantly, better facilities around the country to produce our horses - in the next three years I see myself closing my operation in Ireland and moving to mainland Europe, as all the people I grew up with have done.  I am not asking for subsidies, I am happy to drive my own business forward and to look after that side of things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Broderick"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I am a director at Castlefield Sport Horses.

I spent some years doing this report and I interviewed many stakeholders involved in the industry at all levels, from the top-end professional to the lower level of activities.  It is a broad and diverse sector.  The sport horse is at the centre of it all.  Mr. O'Connor threw out some of the statistics.  There are 14,830 active breeders in the country.  More than 46,000 people are engaged in the industry, with more than 14,000 full-time equivalent employees, and it makes an economic contribution of &euro;816 million, with an export value of &euro;48 million.  All that is achieved with support of about &euro;3 million from the State.<\/p> <p>  In comparison, the thoroughbred sector makes an economic contribution of &euro;1.84 billion and gets about &euro;65 million in funding from the State.  The question that must be asked is if anything like the same level of funding was provided to the sport horse sector, what sort of potential could be realised?  The issues I kept coming up against as I did the research were the lack of support structures and the lack of a strategic plan.  The industry has traditionally been very fragmented and that was reflected in the whole structure and board of Horse Sport Ireland.  <\/p> <p>  That issue, thankfully, has now been addressed and there is a much tighter and more focused board in place.  That is good.  The general funding for the industry, particularly in the area of prize money, is very weak.  The tourism potential of the sector is not recognised and it certainly is not being exploited.  As previous speakers have mentioned, many of our top breeders and riders are being forced to leave the country, which is a great loss of a very talented group of people.  The facilities are not up to scratch and there are also issues with maintaining the quality of the breeding stock. <\/p> <p>  Significant investment in the infrastructure and facilities is needed to try to bring up the level of competition.  There has to be a strong focus on education and knowledge transfer.  A key part of that is to try to create a career for young people in the horse sport area, so that it is not just an activity that they do in their spare time.  It should be made a professional career.  There also needs to be a strong focus on the whole breeding framework.  Importantly, there needs to be a higher standard of competition available for Irish riders and breeders.  If we do not have top quality competitions, we will not have the top quality people participating here and we will continue to see that brain drain.<\/p> <p>  As part of my research, I visited the Netherlands and viewed some of the facilities there, including the Equestrian Centre de Peelbergen.  That is covered in the report.  A number of things struck me about that centre.  The first was the level of professionalism, the second was the quality of the infrastructure in place and the third, importantly, was the local authority was a key funder of that equestrian centre because it recognised the economic and tourism potential that centre brought to a rural area of the Netherlands.  In my experience, the facilities in Peelbergen were up there with the best in class and it is the utopian vision of what the Irish industry can become.  <\/p> <p>  I looked at the potential - and I am not sure if this is a forecast or if it is a target - but if the correct structures are put in place the economic contribution of the industry could be increased by at least 50% very easily.<\/p><p>We could create an extra 700 jobs and it would certainly double the export potential from &euro;48 million to close to &euro;100 million.<\/p><p> Two points stand out in my view.  First, the sport horse industry is an incredibly important contributor to rural economic activity.  It makes a strong rural economic contribution.  Importantly, it makes a strong social contribution as well and it is a key part of many communities.  My final point is crucial.  Ireland has an incredibly strong reputation for the horse.  We need to mind and nurture that reputation.  We are going the wrong way about it at the moment.  If we continue to go in the direction we are going, one half of the whole horse tradition of Ireland is going to be wiped out.  That would be a great pity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Power","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will put a question to the group.

Millstreet has a two-star international.  The number of stars of the show indicate the prize money on offer, with five-star being the biggest, for example, the Dublin Horse Show, and one-star being the smallest.  We have two-star shows in Mullingar and Balmoral.  We have a two-star show in Millstreet, a five-star show in Dublin and a one-star show in Cavan in November.  Basically, there are five shows in the year where people can ride at international level.<\/p> <p>  World ranking is relevant.  A competitor can only win world ranking points in competitions that are 1.45 m or above and the classes have to be worth &euro;25,000 plus.  Basically, it is difficult to win world ranking points in Ireland at a horse show.  There is only one ranking class in Millstreet, one in Mullingar, one in Balmoral and none in Cavan, because it is a one-star event.  There are some classes in Dublin because it is five-star event.  It is particularly difficult for a competitor to base himself in Ireland and stay in the world rankings.<\/p> <p>  This is something we need to look at if we are to have better show centres with better services.  The price of horses nowadays that are in competition at that high standard is relevant.  The last thing a competitor wants to do is jump his horse on a poor surface.  If people are investing in a competitor and his horse to ride at that level, the last thing the competitor wants to do is jeopardise the investment and jump on facilities or surfaces that are not up to scratch or without the basics.  Unfortunately, as silly as it sounds, the facilities and surfaces are far behind in 95% of the show centres throughout the country.<\/p> <p>  Earlier in the year, in January, I went to the sunshine tour in Spain to produce some of my older horses as well as some of my younger horses.  I brought 37 horses to the show in Spain.  It was a major operation to move there.  I would gladly have left 20 of my horses at home to compete with some of my staff and riders in Ireland if there were better facilities and surfaces here.  I am recently home from Vilamoura in Portugal.  We had 22 horses at the show in Portugal.  We were gone for six weeks altogether.  Again, I would gladly have left more than half, perhaps 14 or 15, of the horses at home to do some of the shows in Ireland.  Obviously, it costs me.  It is far more expensive to put them in trucks and bring them that far.  Unfortunately, the shows and good surfaces needed to produce the standard of horses I am trying to keep in Ireland are simply not up to scratch, so I am being forced to go to Europe with the horses.<\/p> <p>  These events in Europe have people who are at the shows because of the nice facilities.  They include agents who are trying to find horses or dealers who have clients looking for horses.  They will go to the nice show centres to find horses.  Unfortunately, there are not enough of those shows in Ireland for people to bring such clients here.  They opt more for Europe and the sunshine tours like those in Portugal and Spain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Broderick"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":96,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Cahill presently.

It raised numerous issues that we need to address.  I was given a question on Horse Sport Ireland by Deputy Darragh O'Brien this morning.  We met Irish Sport Horse Alliance representatives some months ago and they made a presentation to us.  Horse Sport Ireland is a limited company.  Will the Irish Sport Horse Alliance representatives explain the structure?  Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland are semi-State bodies.  Why was there a departure for Horse Sport Ireland?  The Irish Sport Horse Alliance has been set up as a voluntary group.  In fairness, the alliance is not describing itself as being in opposition to Horse Sport Ireland.  Why are Horse Sport Ireland representatives not sitting before the committee today making these points?  HSI is the governing body or the ruling body for the industry.  I am not questioning the bona fides of Mr. O'Connor but I am trying to get to the heart of the issue.  We have Irish Sport Horse Alliance, which is a voluntary group.  I fully accept that.  Mr. Broderick is a neighbour of mine and I know his facilities well.  He has a superb training establishment beside Thurles.  It is a credit to the Broderick family.<\/p> <p>  The public perception is that our showjumping teams are starting to do better internationally.  That is the perception.  We went through a trough when we were unable to compete at the highest level.  My perception is that now we are becoming successful.  I read somewhere that a large number of jockeys or riders rode internationally for Ireland last year.  There could be five or six per team at a show, yet the teams had multiples of that number riding internationally.  Obviously, the riders all have their own horses.  How many of those horses are Irish-bred?  There was a time when almost every horse in a show with an Irish rider was Irish-bred.  What percentage is not sourced here?<\/p> <p>  The Irish Sport Horse Alliance representatives did not mention eventing too much in the presentation.  Does the market for eventing horses have the same issues as showjumping?  At the trials in Badminton and other places we see the odd Irish competitor.  The Irish team completed successfully internationally there in eventing recently.  Do the same problems arise with eventing in terms of structure and prize money, being able to compete at international level, and the breeding of the horses?<\/p> <p>  Let us go back to funding and the hub of the issue.  For Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon there is a 4:1 split in what the Government gives.  The Irish Sport Horse Alliance produced a graph in the brochure given to us.<\/p><p>It shows the horse industry in Ireland at &euro;64 million, the greyhound industry at &euro;16 million, and the sport horse sector at &euro;3.96 million.<\/p><p> Both of those industries would make the point that they have a betting tax that generates income for the Exchequer.  They argue that is why they are getting this money back into their industry and that it is self-financing.  The Irish Sport Horse Alliance does not have the vehicle to do that.  Is Horse Sport Ireland looking for some of that 80:20 split to make it a three-way split rather than a two-way split?  No one can argue with the figures the witnesses have given for the number of people employed, the generation of income and the potential of the industry.  The other two industries would defend their position very vigorously.  Is that where Horse Sport Ireland wants to source the income to promote its industry?<\/p><p> The Dublin Horse Show is world-renowned and we all go and enjoy our day out.  It is probably the only day most of us will go to a showjumping event.  Mr. Broderick said he was in Portugal for the past six weeks.  Will the Irish Sport Horse Alliance be able to attract the top-flight riders here if there are these four or five top events in the year?  Horse racing tracks such as Punchestown and Leopardstown have grade 1 races which will be targeted.  I suppose it is down to our success on the racing front that not many horses come across the water to run in Irish races irrespective of how valuable they are.  It may be that we have become so successful - we are able to go over and win 17 races in Cheltenham - that there is not much point in them coming to try to win races here in Punchestown.  Will the Irish Sport Horse Alliance be able to attract the top-flight riders here when they have their own European circuit?<\/p><p> I fully appreciate how the Irish Sport Horse Alliance is trying to promote its industry.  Will the witnesses flesh out some of the things said so that we can try to put a structure in place to get agreement on a way forward?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#P01200","speaker":"1350","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":104,"content":"<p>We will have all the questions first, if that is acceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#Q00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses.  I am delighted that the Irish Sport Horse Alliance has taken this initiative and has commissioned this report.  Mr. Power outlined the challenge with the industry being fragmented.  In the view of the public it is also fragmented in the value that it brings.  I come from a part of the country where horse sports are all around.  However, what it is delivering to the local economy is not immediately obvious by comparison with other farming, such as beef farming.  Therefore, this is a very worthwhile exercise.  I can see great potential.  There is a labour of love when dealing with sport horses, as is very evident in my part of the country.  This is a good start.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked some very pertinent questions which explained some of what is being requested.  The witnesses have pointed to the need to upgrade facilities which are substandard and pose a challenge to those involved and to the well-being of the horses when they compete there.  The witnesses spoke about education, training and upgrading facilities.  When they speak of prize money, are they suggesting they should get money from the State to provide prize money for competitions?  Is that how it is done in the Netherlands?  Is that the sort of model needed to attract international showjumpers?<\/p> <p>  On the education and training side, how much interface is there with current systems like apprenticeships?  There is a big debate about apprenticeships at the moment.  Are Irish Sport Horse Alliance apprenticeships formally recognised and supported by the Department?  Does further work need to be done to flesh out these things?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses named the top five, but how many show centres are there?  Where is the one closest to the west?  Does the plan focus on strategic regional centres to develop, or is it more widespread?<\/p> <p>  We have been given figures for the number of people involved in the industry, but how many people are involved in the alliance?  How many people subscribe in an active way to what is being proposed here?  While I am sure they would all welcome it, how many people have come together to give the Irish Sport Horse Alliance a mandate to go for it?

When we initiated our contact with the Minister and the Department, the first job of work that the former said he had to do was examine the structure of Horse Sport Ireland, bring it up to date and modernise it as a body.  We liaised with Indecon on the restructuring of Horse Sport Ireland, making it more fit for purpose and making it more transparent where Government payments to it were concerned.  The Minister appoints three members of the board as well as the chairperson and is responsible for signing off on the hiring of the CEO.<\/p> <p>  We work and liaise with Horse Sport Ireland constantly.  We are all involved in various training programmes with it, so we are not in any way split from it or against it.  There is no rivalry whatsoever.  Before it was reorganised, we came together as a group to put together an economic mandate, which was missing from the sports horse industry for years.  That was our fault as well.  We are not here to try to find Ministers, Governments or Departments on which to place blame.  Our industry has since been organised and our structure is up to date.  Horse Sport Ireland asked for &euro;13.1 million to start its education, breeding, prize money and infrastructure programmes.  We got an extra &euro;500,000, bringing us up to &euro;3 million.  I do not know what we can do with that.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we want, or it is feasible for us, to be covered by the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, where the Minister gets the money from is up to him, but we would not want to be seen to be taking money from bodies that are established in that fund.  Getting into it is not one of our goals, but we do need money from somewhere.  That is a question for the Minister.<\/p> <p>  On a relevant point, we are trying to emulate what the racehorse industry has done.  It is an unbelievable product and, as Irish people, we are not proud enough of it.  We hear stories about so and so being worth so much and winning this or that money or about there being three main owners, but those are problems that will only last for a couple of seasons and then it will be something else.  It is one of Ireland's three best products.  As three showjumpers, we are immensely proud of what Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have done with racing.  It is incredible.  When we are abroad, people ask us about it.  We are an island off the coast of Europe that has the best trainer in the world, the best racehorse in the world and some of the leading studs in the world.<\/p> <p>  The Minister and civil servants at our meetings were adamant that they would pay one body, which would then distribute all of the funds, namely, Horse Sport Ireland.  Any funding stream will come from it.  That is important, as we need to tie the high-performance sport into breeding, centres, pony clubs, statistics and databases.  It should all be in one place, as the sector is not big enough to have separate bodies.  That is why we support all funding going to and coming from Horse Sport Ireland.<\/p> <p>  There was a question about Irish-bred sport horses and eventers.  I would like to hand that over to Mr. O'Neill, who is more qualified to discuss whether they have the same problems as showjumpers and whether investment in prize money facilities would have a return for the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#R00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Barry O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":114,"content":"<p>I used to event up to a world cup level.

However, they definitely need a greater prize fund.  For the first time, Irish riders on Irish horses have won medals at a very high level.  We have been exporting many of our best horses around the world.  For 19 years, they have been number one in eventing.  As such, eventers are like showjumpers in that they need more money.

More importantly, if the facilities and surfaces were improved, we could produce our horses to a higher standard.  We are lacking in that respect at the minute.  If that happens, the horses will be worth more money.  Having better facilities available raises the bar for everything, for example, production and the standard of riding.  It would have a domino effect.<\/p> <p>  I finished at the Vilamoura Equestrian Centre ten days ago and then spent eight days in Holland, Belgium, Germany and France looking for new horses.  When I visited some of the very good breeding stables, I noticed that they were working with many international riders.  When one tries to buy their best bred horses, they do not want to sell them.  They are happy to keep them because the animals are working alongside Belgian or French international riders and the stables will sell them to those riders when the horses are old enough.  Thanks to a considerable amount of investment, there is a network of good show facilities within two or three hours of the stables where they can do a great deal of their work.  Many international riders are basing themselves around that infrastructure because it allows them to train well and work alongside breeders.  When international riders take on horses, the better riders base themselves around those facilities.<\/p><p>They can produce the horses to a higher standard.  When foreign customers come from places like the Middle East, the United States or Canada, they do not want horses that are not produced well.  They want horses that are well ridden and well produced, and they want the facilities there for them to do that.  Those horses are being sold for a lot of money and the money then trickles down the line to the breeders, who are able to invest in better mares and better stallions, and pay better stud fees.  As the horses are being well procured to a higher standard, this raises the bar of everything else, so they are able to use a better type of mare or stallion, and to hold tough and give the horses international riders.<\/p><p> Unfortunately, the problem in Ireland is that the facilities and better prize money are not available, so the riders we see winning gold medals in the European championships on ponies or at junior level, like myself when I was 21, are all leaving Ireland and are in Europe and America, where horses are being produced to a higher standard.  There is a bit of a breakdown between the breeders and those international riders, which is definitely affecting the business.  If we had better facilities and better prize money in Ireland, we would keep a better standard of rider and produce horses to a better standard, which without question would have a domino effect down the line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#R00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Greg Broderick","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The issue of prize money comes up regularly.

That places us at a disadvantage and means we have to run a lot faster to try to catch up or to stay up with the others.  As I see it, we are not doing that and we are slipping back.<\/p> <p>  If we accept there is potential for this industry to make a significantly greater contribution, which from a rural and economic development point of view is very important, the State would be justified in intervening where there is this sort of market failure.

I was going to use the analogy of the horse before the cart, but it would probably be inappropriate.

High performance sport encourages local activity and encourages people to get involved and to participate.  However, if one is granting money to a centre, there is a tie-in.  In the Netherlands, when the local authority gave money to the local centre, it had to employ local people and give jobs locally, for example, the part-time jobs that arise when there are events.

I remember being asked a question on a radio show many years ago about the preferential tax treatment for the thoroughbred sector.  For once I said that I could not answer that question because I did not know the answer.  I went away and did a lot of work on it.  I looked at Coolmore Stud.  I grew up in the neighbouring county to Coolmore Stud, which was just across the river.  Coolmore is an incredible contributor to the local economy in south Tipperary.  It is amazing.  It is a world-class facility and it makes a huge contribution to the local economy such as paying premium prices to farmers for hay and straw.  The advantage that the greyhound and the thoroughbred sector has is that they are very narrow and well defined sectors that have always had a very united voice.  The sectors work together and it is one small and narrowly defined industry in both cases, whereas the sport horse sector consists of everything from a small equestrian centre in a rural village in Waterford to what we see in the Royal Dublin Society in August, and everything in between.  That is the problem.  There was never a united approach or a united voice.  I worked very closely with Horse Sport Ireland in the compilation of this report.  I spoke with them a lot throughout the whole process.  I would be very surprised if Horse Sport Ireland had a problem with anything in this report.  We are all on board and there is a much more united approach now.  The restructuring of the board of Horse Sport Ireland is a major step in the right direction.  I would hope that with a stronger voice and with a much more united approach, the sport horse sector would be able to go some way towards emulating the world-class industry we have in the thoroughbred sector.  That should be the sort of utopian vision we have for the horse sport sector, at least from an external perspective looking in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#T01600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jim Power"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":151,"content":"<p>In relation to the facilities, are the representatives thinking of something brand new or investing in existing arenas that are there already as are outlined here?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018112000002#T01700","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":152,"content":"<p>We discussed this earlier today before we came in.

I attend the foal sales at Goresbridge and Cavan.  I can assure the committee the business is flying.  Breeding showjumping horses is currently one of the best businesses across Europe in which a person can be involved.  People in Ireland need to understand this and to not be afraid to invest in it.  When I go to the foal sales, I meet farmers and breeders.  I have noted a disconnect between them.  They do not get to meet enough of the top riders because they are not in the country.  Some of the foals are not well enough bred and so they are being sold for small amounts of money and this is upsetting the farmers and breeders.  As stated, if we had better facilities and prize money, we would be able to keep the better riders in the country.  We do have the best riders in the world.  If we put on bigger and better shows, some of them will come here and that will raise the bar.  There is massive potential in this area.  We need to invest in the facilities and prize money.  As I said, that would raise the bar.  If breeders see a better standard of horse being produced and sold for more money they will get behind it.<\/p> <p>  As we were coming into this meeting there was an online auction underway in Belgium for embryos from some of the good mares in Europe.  The price for one of the embryos was set at &euro;48,000.

FIT is the co-ordinating provider of two ICT apprenticeships, for associate professionals in software development and network engineering, respectively.  We were successful in the first call for submissions.  One might think of us as a good case study of the challenges and opportunities that can arise in expanding apprenticeships into sectors and occupations where there is no tradition of apprenticeship.<\/p> <p>  FIT was established in 1999 to promote an inclusive smart economy.  Its board members are senior executives in leading technology sector companies.  Over the past 20 years, in collaboration with F&Aacute;S and VECs, and latterly SOLAS and education and training boards, we assisted 18,500 jobseekers in gaining access to quality ICT training, of whom over 14,000 have secured employment.  The majority of these candidates have not been third level students, much less graduates who studied STEM subjects.  Prior to the first call for new apprenticeships, FIT had piloted a new dual-education, two-year training programme called ICT associate professional at NFQ level 6 &ndash; FET &ndash; in collaboration with the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS and eight education and training boards.  On this precursor to the technology apprenticeships, 259 candidates were sponsored by 143 companies, with 85% of those completing securing employment.  In collaboration with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, and Intel, FIT designed and ran a new advanced manufacturing maintenance technician programme at NFQ Level 6.  Over 80% of those who completed the programme to date secured employment in Intel and a further 10% elsewhere.  The vast majority of these candidates had no previous knowledge or experience in the discipline, further demonstrating how FET can cater for highly technical roles.  With the support of KWETB, the capacity of the programme has since been doubled.<\/p> <p>  In the light of this background FIT welcomed the development of a new national policy on apprenticeships and traineeships, the establishment of the Apprenticeship Council and the creation of QQI quality and programme-validation processes for apprenticeships.  <\/p> <p>  In tandem with the first call, FIT developed two ICT apprenticeships to meet the skills needs of employers while making tech employment more inclusive.  The positive response we have got from IT employers led us to adopt the goal of achieving an annual intake of 1,000 ICT apprentices by 2021 through expanding the portfolio of tech apprenticeships into complementary areas, such as cybersecurity, FinTech, DevOps, virtualisation and digital forensics.  There is strong employer demand in Ireland for ICT skills.  There is demand not just for high skills but also for intermediate or associate professional skills that are well within the capability of appropriately designed FET programmes.  In periodic ICT skills audits based on large numbers of face-to-face interviews with IT employers, FIT has consistently found the majority of posts they were seeking to fill required the exercise of skills at levels they described as entry or competent rather than expert.  Employment of ICT practitioners is concentrated in our four largest cities but there are now growing pockets in every region, some of which have grown particularly rapidly.<\/p> <p>  To ensure the shared ambition for modern apprenticeships becoming a key source of talent acquisition for employers and an option of choice for many jobseekers, it is FIT's view that there are aspects of the current programme needing attention and enhancement.  Existing administration processes for the new apprenticeships need to be reviewed to ensure fitness for purpose.  A national and persistent promotional campaign needs to be implemented immediately to ensure broad appreciation of the range of apprenticeships now available and in development, with particular emphasis to encourage more women to consider the opportunity.  The final aspect concerns the adoption of funding models that support more effectively the early-stage development and implementation cycle of new apprenticeships and take account of the diverse needs that pertain across sectors.<\/p> <p>  While early take-up may be challenging, requiring a change in mindsets, more ambitious targets for the expansion of new apprenticeships are necessary to sustain the job growth in Ireland's buoyant economy through a broadening of talent pipelines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Davitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":209,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Davitt.

Employer buy-in is critical, as the apprenticeship and traineeship models depend on employers taking on apprentices.<\/p> <p>  I do not underestimate the challenge of shifting attitudes in a society that still defines educational achievement in terms of CAO points and direct entry to higher education.  I am convinced, however, that if we could offer real alternatives to ambitious and capable young people and, most critically, real progression opportunities up to advanced degree level through apprenticeships, attitudes could be changed.  Apprenticeships would no longer be second-best options.<\/p> <p>  It is almost six years since IBEC was invited to participate on the then Government's review of apprenticeship training.  At the time, it was felt that the apprenticeship system, which was limited to 26 craft-based occupations, did not reflect the broad skill needs of the Irish economy.  The review suggested a new model of business-led apprenticeships that could boost skill levels across the economy and help to get people into quality, sustainable jobs.  A lot of effort has been put into the new apprenticeships project to turn this aspiration into a reality.  IBEC has at times been frustrated at the speed at which the new apprenticeships have come on stream but, in retrospect, this probably should not be a surprise.  This is a major shift for businesses in terms of how they recruit and train people, and for the education system in terms of how it delivers programmes.<\/p> <p>  We submitted a detailed submission to members in advance of this hearing on how we believe the number of new apprentice registrations could be significantly increased.  As members heard at last week's committee meeting, registrations are a year behind schedule in terms of the targets set out in the action plan to expand apprenticeships and traineeships for the period 2016 to 2020.<\/p><p>Our recommendations can be grouped around three main themes: marketing, support for employers hiring apprentices, and governance and streamlining the new apprenticeship approval process.<\/p><p> As the committee heard last week, the apprenticeship campaign has made significant progress in raising the profile of apprenticeships with key stakeholders, such as guidance counsellors, learners, business and the media.  However, a targeted campaign on the value proposition of apprenticeships for firms is needed.  SMEs and owner-managers are a particularly difficult business segment to address in terms of expanding take-up but they are incredibly important.  They tend to be time poor, have limited numbers of staff to support apprentices and may not even be aware of how the potential talent delivered through the apprenticeship system could improve their business.<\/p><p> A major obstacle to the expansion of new apprenticeships, especially among SMEs, is cost.  There is strong evidence that the cost of paying a salary and subsistence while the apprentice is off the job becomes a major disincentive.  Our submission includes a case study which demonstrates that the total cost of a newly recruited apprentice manufacturing engineer is approximately &euro;90,000.  Therefore, we believe that the cost of funding new apprenticeship off-the-job wages, plus travel and subsistence costs where necessary, should be supported through the National Training Fund.  This would also address the anomaly whereby similar costs for traditional craft apprenticeships are subvented.<\/p><p> I now wish to address the issue of governance and streamlining the approval process.  The landscape around the development and promotion of apprenticeships is fragmented with multiple actors.  These include the Department of Education and Skills, SOLAS, the Higher Education Authority, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, two apprenticeship advisory committees, education and training boards, higher education institutions, multiple industry groups, and trade unions.  This can lead to disconnections and delays.  We believe the time has come to consolidate these different elements into a dedicated agency, working with business consortia and education providers, to oversee the funding, development and promotion of apprenticeships.<\/p><p> The new apprenticeship project has been developed under the legal framework of the Industrial Training Act 1967.  At one level, it is testimony to the amount of goodwill that exists towards apprenticeships in the system that any new apprenticeships have been delivered through a 40 year old legal framework that was designed for a different industrial era.<\/p><p> All the legal requirements in the 1967 Act around protections, rights and responsibilities of apprentices and employers are still valid.  However, other requirements have made the development of new apprenticeships and the registering of new companies a bureaucratic process.  This can be seen in the 12 steps laid out in the apprenticeship plan.  The Government committed to an overall timeframe of 12 to 15 months from development to roll-out.  This has not been achieved and, in some instances, proposals that were approved after the first call in January 2015 have not come on stream.<\/p><p> There is a major challenge around keeping companies engaged which originally expressed interest in the apprenticeship project.  Given the constantly changing business environment and skills requirement, the system needs to respond more swiftly.<\/p><p> Having said all that, I will finish by acknowledging the progress made and stating that business remains firmly committed to the apprenticeship project.  The project is gaining momentum.  If we address some of these outstanding issues, it can be significantly scaled up, deliver new opportunities for young people, and improve the competitiveness of business.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for this opportunity and look forward to answering its questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donohoe.

We felt it was important to have the opportunity to talk to Dr. Smyth, especially with the challenges facing the hospitality sector and given that the college is involved in WorldSkills.

I will speak under the following three headings: why a contribution from Shannon College, the reasons for low uptake, and recommendations.<\/p> <p>  As to why, Shannon College, NUI Galway, is successful in educating leaders for hotels and hospitality.  It recruits high-calibre candidates to level 8 programmes, retains them, equips them with professional, business and life skills, places them in the workplace and ensures that they are employed when they graduate.  Its alumni have been influential in hospitality and tourism.  The founder, Dr. Brendan O'Regan, was told in 1951 that there were not jobs for 12 qualified hoteliers in Ireland.  Shannon College now has 500 students.<\/p> <p>  Its comprehensive placement programmes promote strong links with the employer and a deep understanding of skills requirements.  We attract significant numbers of quality applicants for the hospitality sector, which traditionally is not well regarded by such influencers as career guidance counsellors and parents, who have negative perceptions about work-life balance and abilities required.<\/p> <p>  As to why there is low uptake, first, in hospitality, the availability of labour for tourism and hospitality tends to be countercyclical in all developed countries.  While very hospitable and friendly, our history makes us uncomfortable with service, in my opinion, and therefore there is a widespread underestimation among the population of the level and range of skills required in hospitality and, more importantly, the opportunities.<\/p> <p>  During the recession, tourism was recognised as a pillar of the economy.  Perception improved though such initiatives as The Gathering and the Wild Atlantic Way.  Irish people who previously would not have considered tourism as a career started to work in hospitality.  Unfortunately, this is now being reversed with admissions to all hospitality programmes declining.  There will be at least 60,000 additional jobs in the next ten years - at the tourism conference in Killarney two weeks ago, they were talking about 80,000 - and industry practitioners are pessimistic about filling them domestically.  Exacerbating this outlook is the fact that provision for apprenticeships in hospitality is weak.<\/p> <p>  In Ireland, the prestige of apprenticeships has definitely declined.  There is still great respect for the tradesman, the expert or the artisan, but it has been overwhelmed, as IBEC stated, by the ever-present media, public and private discourse on points, CAO deadlines, college places, change of mind dates, accommodation, etc.  In Switzerland, two thirds of 15 year olds enter apprenticeships which are highly valued in society.  If a Shannon College graduate who was placed in Switzerland wants to go back to be a manager there after graduation in Ireland, he or she must go back to the beginning of the apprenticeship system.<\/p> <p>  On recommendations, State-funded research is required into attitudes to apprenticeship to inform a long-term marketing strategy.  This strategy, with a strong message around words such as \"expert\" and others I have mentioned, should include the use of school liaison officers, which has been successful, as the committee will see from the main submission from Shannon College.<\/p> <p>  Consideration should be given to level 8 apprenticeships, if only to address the negative educational perceptions of the overall apprentice scheme.  Ireland should host WorldSkills as soon as possible to boost the image of apprenticeships in the country generally.<\/p> <p>  Leaving certificate subjects and curricula should be evaluated to see to what extent they can lead to apprenticeships, both in terms of motivation but also content.  It is strongly recommended that a separate subject in tourism and hospitality be offered.  It is amazing that in the current business studies programme in the leaving certificate there is no hospitality or business section while one in nine of the working population is employed in hospitality and it is a pillar of society.<\/p> <p>  Lastly, there is an urgent need for the development of a comprehensive suite of apprenticeships in hospitality.  I recognise, however, that this would be difficult, and two good chef trainee programmes, at levels 6 and 7, have been developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Phillip Smyth"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":214,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Smyth.

They have worked closely with SOLAS, the Apprenticeship Council and other stakeholders while continuing to deliver craft apprenticeship training nationally.  The commis chef apprenticeship was rolled out in Kerry in the fourth quarter of 2017, with 125 apprentices registered with 104 participating employers.  The auctioneering and property services apprenticeship has been rolled out in Dublin and Cork, with 52 apprentices registered with 40 participating employers.  The butcher apprenticeship was rolled out recently and registrations are ongoing for the 2018 intake.  The original equipment manufacturer engineering apprenticeship was validated recently, following engagement with Quality and Qualifications Ireland, and is preparing for roll-out in Cavan-Monaghan and Limerick-Clare ETBs.  The remaining five new industry-led apprenticeships are in development and preparing for submission to Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  ETBs have been actively engaged with industry partners since 2016, with 24 new traineeships introduced to date.  As Dr. Smyth has mentioned, four traineeships were rolled out in 2016 in the areas of hospitality, engineering and interior systems.  An additional six traineeships were introduced in 2017 in the areas of animation, certified accountancy pathway, digital sales and marketing, engineering operations, hairdressing and laboratory assistance.  There has been a significant increase in 2018, with 14 new traineeships being rolled out with another ten traineeships are planned.<\/p><p> The uptake of people participating in new apprenticeships and traineeships has been lower than projected.  Several factors need to be considered to understand and inform the current challenges.  The SOLAS-authorised officers appointed in ETBs need to reflect the expansion of the apprenticeship model and the requirement to engage and support employers.  Ways of attracting, incentivising and supporting employers who employ and train apprentices need to be considered further.  As previous speakers have mentioned, the ETBI will continue to work with SOLAS, the Apprenticeship Council, the Department of Education and Skills and other stakeholders to enhance the marketing and promotion of apprenticeships and traineeships at national level.  The ETBI acknowledges the importance of career guidance to empower young people to make well-informed and sustainable educational choices.  As we address some of these challenges, we plan to host a learner-centred further education and training conference to create awareness and understanding of options and career pathways to work-based learning opportunities for learners, parents and career guidance counsellors.  I can confirm that following engagement with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, on 11 December guidance counsellors will have their first opportunity to engage in continuous professional development with a number of stakeholders.  This should start to address the challenges in this area.  Continued resourcing of the further education and training sector in terms of recruitment and retention of suitably qualified staff and access to state-of-the-art training facilities is critical if ETBs are to continue to support work-based learning in the 21st century.<\/p><p> ETBs have been working collaboratively with industry partners, SOLAS, Quality and Qualifications Ireland and other providers and will continue to do so.  We are playing a leading role in the provision of cost-effective, off-the-job training to apprentices and trainees across a wide range of career areas in communities where apprentices and trainees reside.

Has there been one-to-one engagement with people who are on apprenticeships?  What has been heard from apprentices during that engagement?  When I speak to some of them, they tell me that the lack of money in their pockets is a kind of disincentive.  This brings me back to the need for a cultural shift.  Perhaps apprenticeship needs to be seen as an educational process that eventually leads to a fully fledged career.  What are the blockages on the ground for the apprentices who are going through these systems?  The explanation does not need to be scientific.  There is a need for role models to go into schools.  The work of career guidance teachers needs to be complemented by people who can walk into schools and talk about their careers.  Perhaps they did not like school and were more interested in certain things outside school, such as the craft industry.  I take the point that the trades are seen as more popular.  We need to start focusing on apprenticeships as a means of opening up possibilities for young people.  That is an important side of the debate.  Role models need to go into schools.  In the experience of the witnesses, what do apprentices say about the blockages?  The need for a cultural shift and a change in mindset is a key point that we need to overcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#F00300","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today's meeting and making their insightful presentations.  I would like to ask a couple of questions about upskilling in the energy-efficiency sector.  As Ms White will be aware, Waterford-Wexford Education and Training Board is developing a centre of excellence in the area of nearly zero-energy building.  Limerick Institute of Technology has worked with the board to develop the training content for programmes that will upskill electricians, plumbers and blocklayers, etc.  I wonder whether Ms White might comment on this specific project.  Are other ETBs looking to take it up?  What lessons can be learned from this initiative as we seek to make sure there is investment in apprenticeships and to recognise the need to shift to the new green economy, which will provide job opportunities?  Do the education and training boards need supports in delivering these programmes?  Are they getting enough funding and supports for the shift to a green economy that is needed?<\/p> <p>  It has been said that many of those who are working in new green areas like renovation, retrofitting and energy-efficiency have been trained overseas.  What is being done at a regional level to upskill and support the retrofitting sector through the ETBs?  Does the ETBI have a policy in that area?<\/p> <p>  I would like to comment on the gender balance issue as it applies to those who are being fast-tracked into information technology.  One of the submissions recommended that there should be a campaign to encourage women to take up apprenticeships.  What would that look like?  How is it imagined that this could be done in the information technology area and across the wider apprenticeship sector?<\/p> <p>  I mentioned last week that an incentive - perhaps the equivalent of the Athena SWAN award - might be needed to encourage institutions and businesses to get involved in this area.

Is tourism and hospitality, or something very similar to it, not a subject on the leaving certificate applied curriculum?  Has it been reviewed to determine how successful it has been?  If tourism and hospitality has been successful as a leaving certificate applied subject, could that help to persuade the Department of Education and Skills to put it on the leaving certificate as well?

I thank the four witnesses for their informative opening statements.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by raising an issue that came up here last week as well.  I refer to the disparity in the female take-up of apprenticeships.  This is a huge issue because the percentage is small.  There was a skills and apprenticeships day in Limerick and the mid-west last week.  It was very good to see so many young females coming along.  They are certainly receiving more encouragement.  How do we get more of them to participate?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  It is sometimes the case that there is no incentive for employers to take on people as apprentices.  I know that employers pay PRSI and the various fees associated with taking someone on in employment.  They provide very good training to people.<\/p><p>Could employers be given some form of tax relief or an incentive to take on apprentices?<\/p><p> I am very aware of the skills shortage in the hospitality sector as I come from that background.  While it is great to be able to get hotel managers, finding lower-level staff is a major problem.  There was a loosening of the visa criteria for employees in the hospitality sector.  Will Dr. Smyth comment on whether more needs to be done?<\/p><p> Last week. I accompanied some hairdressers to meet the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Halligan, to discuss the increase in the VAT rate they face.  There is no incentive for them to take on apprentices and train them because they do not benefit from the process.  Once the trainee becomes a skilled hairdresser, he or she walks out the door, having finished the training.  How does one keep people engaged so that the employer feels they benefit?

She told us about her school days and how she tried out as an air hostess and then came back to working with her Dad as a plumber.  She was a cool trendy young girl who made the apprenticeship look cool and trendy and that is one element of what we need to do to change culture and conditioning.  The other element on which I am focused is the engagement with parents.  We know that the home is where young people are encouraged to do something.  I take the point that liaising and informing guidance counsellors is a really key part but we have to focus on the role of the parents as well.<\/p> <p>  We are all invested in the marketing of apprenticeships.  SOLAS and many of the partners are highly focused on this point.  It is about hearing what the employers are saying to the effect that there is no return on investment in training apprentices.  It is about addressing these issues in communications.<\/p> <p>  I think about the reason that education and training boards, ETBs, are perceived as different.  I think about the Suzuki garage I pass this morning.  I heard the story from a female apprentice mechanic who went to an ETB school in Carnew.  She wanted to become an apprentice mechanic but she could not get any employer to take her on.  The principal of the ETB went from employer to employer until she succeeded.  She is now an example for us in Gorey of somebody who has formed the linkage.  As ETBs we have that strength.<\/p> <p>  I am really focused on telling the story of apprenticeships in order that the story goes out to parents and students that an apprenticeship is a viable option.  We are focused on doing that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nessa White"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>I will respond to Deputy Naughton's point on blockages.  Within the tech sector in particular it is a very complex issue because they are so many stereotypical misnomers.  We hear that to have a career in the tech sector, one must have a degree or a master's degree and one must have STEM subjects to even enter into the sector.  That is a deterrent for may people, both female and male.  For me there is a much bigger issue here.  We have an obsession that our children must go to third level education and if one does not take the route of third level, one is a second-class citizen in some respects in terms of accessing training.<\/p> <p>  From my perspective, a level 6 FET is the forgotten certificate award.  A level 6 award is above an honours leaving certificate.  It is equivalent to a diploma or an advanced certificate.  If one builds a curriculum to that standard with the right content, the demand for those with that qualification across industry is phenomenal.  We undertook a number of skills audits because my board is comprised of major tech companies in Ireland.  Why are they engaged with FIT?  They engage with FIT in terms of accessing skills.  We had to go out to ask employers what skills they wanted.  In the early days, the employers wanted employees with degrees and masters, but when we were able to show them what could be delivered through a level 5 programme and what could be delivered through a level 6 programme, the scales fell off their eyes to the extent that as the tech sector is buoyant and growing, there are job opportunities for many more than those who perceive themselves as having roles in the tech sector.  The interesting thing is there is a growing awareness within the tech sector that unless it diversifies its recruitment pipelines, it will struggle in the future.  There is a genuine desire in the tech sector to address the issue of diversity and to increase female participation.  We must, however, make it attractive.  Whether one if male or female, if one goes the route of an FET qualification, one is seen as an equivalent competent individual as somebody who takes the route of a third level qualification.  That is the essence of it.  Thereafter, we have to definitely profile role models.  We have also to get across to people that the jobs in the tech sector are not just about sitting in front of a computer.  The idea of having regular demonstrations of the variety of cohorts that come into the sectors is very important.<\/p> <p>  We have to get parity of esteem for FET provision.  We have won that argument with companies.  The companies now want to access the apprentices and we are getting real traction for the tech apprenticeships, but we need to win the argument with young people, learners and the mothers and fathers of Ireland that this is a credible route to a good career for their sons or daughters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Davitt"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":225,"content":"<p>Is a campaign needed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#G00400","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":226,"content":"<p>We need more than a campaign.

The best way to learn is to learn by doing under the guidance of an expert.  That is what apprenticeship ultimately try to deliver.  I think we have to address collectively this imbalance of perception of the value of one level of provision as against another provision.  We then have to showcase the opportunities.  There is an opportunity for example on the new apprenticeship website to profile more careers that can attract a variety of different people into it.  There are policy and communication issues and appropriate progression pathways must be created.  One point made earlier is that we have to have a much more dynamic career guidance delivery.  Let me recount my personal experience.  Two years ago, my daughter was in sixth year and sitting the leaving certificate.  When I went to the parent-teacher meeting, there was no conversation beyond third level.  It was explained how one might get to Trinity College, DIT or DCU but there was no conversation about FET provision or PLCs and there definitely was no conversation around apprenticeships.

However there is another leaving certificate, the leaving certificate applied which is really very good.  In every family in Ireland, the leaving certificate is key.

It is an intangible institution in all our lives.<\/p> <p>  One can do all the marketing one likes and a great deal of marketing and targeting must be done but one has to change perception.

We have occupational segregation.  Apprenticeship is just a way of learning.  The low female participation rate reflects the trades where apprenticeships already exist, and that is why the new apprenticeship project is so important.  The most successful new apprenticeship so far is the insurance apprenticeship from the institute, in which 60% of the apprentices are female.  The second most successful apprenticeship is the one run by Accounting Technicians Ireland, in which 60% of the apprentices are female.  The bio-pharma sector of IBEC launched a laboratory technician apprenticeship two weeks ago.  Again, females are outnumbering males on it.  As occupations evolve, we will see more female participation.<\/p> <p>  There is a specific issue around the involvement of girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects.  The issue has been well-covered by previous speakers in terms of providing role models and that kind of thing.<\/p> <p>  I want to address the issues raised by Senator Byrne about incentives for companies, particularly given that apprentices might leave.  There is an old saying about whether employers can afford to invest in upskilling, and my response to that is whether they can afford not to.  They have to do this.  We have a great window of opportunity now because companies are screaming out, as it were, for skills across a whole range of occupations.  This would have been a much more difficult conversation five or six years ago.  Especially with small firms, the approach tends to be one of build it and they will come, which does not happen.  The average small firm only thinks about where the business opportunities and the business threats are.  Such firms do not think of skills conceptually.  They have business challenges.  There is a missing piece in the jigsaw in terms of demonstrating how upskilling more generally but specifically bringing in apprentices or providing opportunities for trainees could bring a business dividend.  Enterprise Ireland has one or two tools that it is running through the regional skills fora.  That initiative requires a very serious ramping up.  It is a skills needs analysis service.<\/p> <p>  The new SOLAS document, entitled Review of pathways to participation in apprenticeship, discusses a new portal where employers can advertise their apprenticeships.  My only question is why it has taken five years for that to be there.  That would be a basic requirement.  People like Further Education and Training, FET, or the various consortia are marketing their apprenticeships, but we need a place where if a company is prepared to offer an apprenticeship, it can offer it online and young people and their families can access this and apply online.  It is a fairly basic requirement.<\/p> <p>  In terms of support for costs, I do not think tax relief, due to the complexity of it, is necessarily the way to go.  Our ask on this is far more modest.  It is that the apprentices&rsquo; off-the-job wages, when they are training in a college, and any associated travel costs would be picked up by the State through the National Training Fund.  That is what happens with every other type of apprenticeship.  We have met some resistance, again particularly from small firms who just see this as a cost in a way that maybe some of the bigger companies do not.  Even that adjustment would make a lot of difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Does Deputy Martin seek a clarification?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#H00300","speaker":"1257"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>Yes.

Most of the questions have been asked and answered.  The big thing that is coming across is the importance of both awareness and the status of doing an apprenticeship as opposed to higher education etc.<\/p> <p>  All of us in the room were at an event this morning which was a photograph of past and present women Members of the Oireachtas.  It is essentially about visual role models, and Ms White talked about the young plumber.  Dr. Smyth talked about the fact that there are a lot of women in the new apprenticeships, but we very much need to see them.  There is the Generation Apprenticeship campaign around awareness and so on.  I am interested in whether the witnesses have any other ideas on how that awareness can be raised because that should be a central point in our report.  It came up so much last week and it is coming up so much again this week.  Mr. Davitt talked about the importance of awareness for young people and their parents and Dr. Smyth talked about awareness for employers as well, so we need to see this on both sides.  My general question is around what we can do in this regard.<\/p> <p>  The other issue related to that is about status.  We talked last week about school league tables, the newspapers that publish league tables and that they say a certain school is the most wonderful school in the world because 100% of students went on to higher education.  I spoke to somebody, who was at the committee last week, about the fact that some efforts are being made to get the newspapers concerned to broaden what they measure and to include apprenticeships.<\/p><p>Will IBEC join the campaign to get a broader definition?  I am sure it has a powerful influence on the media, etc.  This takes in the delegates in their various roles and us as a committee.  As long as a school gets a top grade because it sends everyone to college, it will not send anyone to take up an apprenticeship and people may look down on someone who wants to do so.  It is a really big barrier in getting parity of esteem.  Did Dr. Smyth say entry to colleges connected to the hospitality sector was declining?  Perhaps I misunderstood him.  Will he clarify the matter as the hospitality sector is across the regions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#H01400","speaker":"1325","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":243,"content":"<p>I assume Deputy Thomas Byrne is coming back at some point, but I have a few general questions and one or two specific queries.  <\/p> <p>  We almost have full employment.  Is it having a negative impact in attracting prospective students to apprenticeships and traineeships?  <\/p> <p>  Going back to the idea of parity of esteem, if apprenticeships and traineeships were properly promoted - we all agree that this absolutely must happen - and expanded to include level 8 and above, would it become a more viable route, particularly for students who want to get a degree?  They may not be in a financial position to go to college, but if they could find a pathway, it could really work.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Davitt established FIT Limited, but what major changes has he seen since 1999 in the employment sector?  He has stated he has adopted the goal of achieving an annual intake of 1,000 information and communications technology apprentices by 2021, but how close is he to meeting that target?  Are there particular issues or challenges he is coming across or in respect of which he would like to see reforms?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Donohoe mentioned legislation, an issue about which we also spoke briefly last week.  Would consolidation or an updating of the Acts governing the apprenticeship schemes make the process easier and a more attractive option, particularly for employers?  We are trying to attract young people into apprenticeships, but we are also trying to attract employers.  That is a key point.  Following possible changes to the relevant legislation, would a stand-alone agency be warranted for apprenticeships and trainee schemes?<\/p> <p>  Dr. Smyth has said if a Shannon College of Hotel Management graduate wants to be a manager in Switzerland, he or she must go back to the beginning of the apprenticeship system, despite having one of the best qualifications in the world.  The college is absolutely renowned.  Will the introduction of the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill 2018 which is aimed at facilitating the introduction of the international education mark help in that regard?  It could lead to a position where qualifications acquired here would be recognised internationally.  We certainly see it as something that would help.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that we had met the Irish participants in the WorldSkills finals last year and were very impressed.  When we met the group, we advocated that Ireland should hold the event.  What advantages would there be for the hospitality sector if that were to come about?  <\/p> <p>  There was mention in the submissions of having special sections dealing with apprenticeships in transition year in secondary school.  It is absolutely key that it happen in the transition year programme, as most students have at least three periods of work experience.  Perhaps we might get to a position where one of them would cover something in this sector.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that education and training boards, ETBs, do a lot of work in this area.  Mr. Davitt gave as examples Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board and Intel, which was great.  I am sure there are other such partnerships which could be rolled out.  <\/p> <p>  Does Ms White think there is enough access to state-of-the-art training facilities and equipment to support learning?  Is anybody aware of really good practices abroad?  Part of what the committee wants to do is considering practices abroad.  There is a place outside Amsterdam where something like a small village has been set up and everything is based on apprenticeships.  People can stay in a hotel and have food.  Others can bring in pieces of equipment that can be worked on, etc.  It is a really good model in attracting people and showcasing the process.<\/p> <p>  What supports are required by ETBs to enable them to play a more effective role in the promotion of apprenticeships and traineeships?  What incentives could be suggested to encourage greater participation by employers?

I will refer to the \"head\" and the \"heart\".  FIT's DNA is creating second chance opportunities - reskilling - in order that people can secure jobs in the technological sector.  In the early days, from 1999 to the early 2000s, companies engaged with FIT probably more from the perspective of corporate social responsibility.  They might have thought about getting one or two candidates through the process.  In the period since of almost 20 years we have seen a total transformation and are now a talent acquisition pipeline for the technological sector in Ireland.  We are on the radar for most companies as part of their recruitment initiatives and strategies.  We have demonstrated the currency and calibre of people who can be delivered by further education and training to levels 5 and 6.  Ultimately, companies are not preoccupied with credentials but rather competencies.  They want people to have the skills for the job in question.  Most industry certification that is in demand in companies is equivalent to level 6.  We have won that argument, but, going back to my earlier point, we must win it with the broader population.  They must see it as a credible and equal route to a professional career.  That is a fundamental change.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked if full employment had an impact, but in our recruitment processes we do not currently see it as a problem for a variety of reasons.  In some third level tech courses there is a drop-out rate of up to 70%.  There is a large cohort of people who, for one reason or another, cannot progress or access the route to third level education.  They are hungry for an alternative route.  When we look at the cohort currently in apprenticeship programmes, ages range from those in their early 20s to the middle of their 30s and 40s.  People have worked in the industry or are reskilling or upskilling.  They may have participated in third level education for a period, but, for one reason or another, they were unable to continue.  Some people already have degrees.  Others are those who I call \"tech enthusiasts\".  Another cohort comprises foreign nationals who have skills in this area but which are not necessarily recognised.<\/p> <p>  We have a rich cohort of people from which to draw, but there is a challenge in that we do not want to put anybody forward for an apprenticeship programme if he or she will not be successful.  We must do a lot of assessing and screening in advance.  We mentioned some of the fundamental problems.  There are issues related to promotion and administrative challenges which slow the process.  The issue of funding has still not been resolved for apprenticeships this year or next year.  We are committed to delivering 1,000 tech apprenticeships by 2021; it is a decision of the board of FIT and we believe we can deliver on it.  We hope to have 250 up and running by March next year and a further 400 by December next year.  If our needs are addressed, it is a realistic goal.<\/p><p>We also have engagement from the Civil Service, which is looking at this as a credible recruitment stream for its needs.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Davitt","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":250,"content":"<p>I will comment in the first instance on Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's comments on the school league tables.  I agree with her and her suggestion is worth pursuing.  They are such a crude measure of achievement and I am not simply talking about it in terms of apprenticeships.  There are many aspects to the education experience and the development of the young person that go well beyond the CAO points he or she achieves.  No metric is coming to mind at the moment, but I definitely think it is worth pursuing as an idea.<\/p> <p>  We have spoken about status a number of times today.  If some of the companies on Mr. Davitt's board, which are the top global companies in the world, are prepared to offer apprenticeships, those apprenticeships will have status.  These companies have serious brand power and they believe it is the thing to do.  In the pharmaceutical sector we have seen some household names taking on apprentices.  However, other things also need to happen, including in the area of marketing.  We can only do so much, but if we target the companies and get them to offer apprenticeships, it would be a good use of time and resources.  <\/p> <p>  I do not believe full employment will have a serious adverse impact.  The registrations for traditional apprenticeships, predominately in the construction sector, are ahead of target.  I noticed today that the CSO figures show a 3% increase in overall employment from quarter 3 of 2017 to quarter 3 of this year.  Most of those jobs were in the construction sector and they are obviously needed.  That industry is moving in the right direction.  Our main blockage is in the area of new apprenticeships, which is probably not a surprise because the construction sector, for the past 40 or 50 years, has been using apprenticeships.  They are part of its culture and way of doing business.  We are not breaking new ground in that area, whereas we are with the new apprenticeships.  <\/p> <p>  On the consolidation of the legislation and the idea of a stand-alone agency, it must be said that there have been process delays in approving and rolling out these apprenticeships.  When the first call was made in 2015 many companies expressed enthusiasm and there was energy around the proposal.  Three years down the line, some of these companies are still waiting.  In terms of amendments to the legislation, as I said, it is not about the contracts of apprenticeship in terms of protections for the apprentice and the responsibilities of employers.  That is fine and I would not change a word of that.  It is about registering companies and improving industrial sectors.  The people in the sector have pushed this to its boundary.  For example, there is a requirement that the SOLAS board approve a new industrial sector.  When it was asked to do so, it put the approval through in jig time.  While this requirement has not been an impediment, it should not be in place.<\/p> <p>  Last week, the committee heard the chair of a stand-alone agency called Skillnet talk about what it is doing in terms of upskilling.  It is a different product because Skillnet deals with 15,000 companies and has 50,000 employees taking part in its programmes.  Many of them are shorter programmes or interventions, but it has to meet its metrics.  It is a very efficient system.  It could be wrapped into an existing agency or a separate agency could be created.  I am always loath to suggest the creation of another quango, but we probably need a dedicated service for this.<\/p> <p>  Apprenticeships are positioned along the fault line of further education and higher education.  We still have an education system that operates in a silo.  We talk about progression and in reality there is some progression.  While we are getting better, apprenticeships still tend to travel on a parallel track.  The advanced apprenticeships are funded by the HEA, while SOLAS is funding apprenticeships up to level 6.  There are disconnections there.<\/p> <p>  There is a significant amount of money available for apprenticeships.  This year, some &euro;120 million has been allocated to them, of which, incidentally, only &euro;13 million is for the new apprenticeships we spent such a long time discussing.  I would prefer to see a single agency managing all of that and promoting apprenticeships.  This was alluded to in the original apprenticeship review group, which spoke about plural arrangements.  We are probably approaching the time when such an agency has to be set up.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of advanced apprenticeships, I am often accused of aiding the capture of apprenticeships by higher education because I talk so much about advanced apprenticeships and the requirement for degree apprenticeships and master's apprenticeships.  We are even developing a PhD apprenticeship at the moment.  I do not believe there will be huge number of those apprenticeships on offer, but the fact that they exist sends out an important message.  I do not think that will be the educational experience for everybody, but the progression opportunity has to be provided.  That is how we address the issue of status.  A person starting at a level 5 or level 6 may not want to go to degree or master's level, but the fact that the progression route is available addresses much of the status challenge we have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tony Donohoe"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":251,"content":"<p>On Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's questions, within the CAO system there has been a decline in demand for levels 6, 7 and 8 qualifications.  This includes a decline in applicants for hospitality related courses in general across the institutes of technology and the university sector.  That has been the case for the Shannon College of Hotel Management and NUI Galway, and it has transferred through to the number of students coming to our colleges.  In Shannon we were reasonably well protected because our numbers had been very high and we still have the interview process.  It is also the case that many of our applicants have listed our college as a first, second or third preference, so many of them would hold.  I have spoken to some of the people in the training centres in the last couple of weeks who have found it more difficult to join the excellent courses on offer.  Anecdotally, there has been chat in the institute of technology about closing particular programmes because not enough people are applying for them.  That is just in the area of hospitality.<\/p> <p>  The educational mark is of major benefit to our college in terms of our international marketing.  In Switzerland it is a philosophical issue.  If one of our students goes back to work in a hotel in Switzerland, perhaps for personal reasons, he or she would find it extremely difficult to progress on the management side because the Swiss do not believe in moving people very quickly through companies.  They want the skills of the student to be deeply embedded.  They also do not want to see their own apprentices being outstripped by people who have not experienced the same basic training.  They do not have a problem with that.  In my main submission I said that at a meeting with Swiss business people they will often boast about the actual skills they still possess.  It could be in IT, woodwork or another area but they still hold that in high regard, both for themselves and for other people.  <\/p> <p>  On WorldSkills, from an employment and apprenticeship point of view, having the WorldSkills come to Ireland would be like hosting the World Cup.  There would be a constant, protracted competition for eight or nine days, featuring 60 different skills.  Every conceivable kind of skill would be featured.<\/p><p>Gold medals would be awarded and there would be constant razzmatazz.  Something like that would have an impact on young people, particularly if we used it properly, projected it through the media and so on.<\/p><p> Regarding transition year, our university has been providing taster days in all programmes for a while.  During study week when our lecturers are not teaching, we invite schools to bring in groups of transition year students and give them a taste of the programme - a little time in the kitchen, a little time in the restaurant.  We also given them an overall feel of the business subjects, including accounting and economics.  There might be a fun element with a little present when they go away and so on.  We do all of that just to give them something else to consider.<\/p><p> Regarding schools liaison officers, we had become successful in international recruitment by the start of the boom in 2003 or 2004, but all of a sudden, our Irish numbers started to decline.  After considering the issue a great deal, we went with the idea of schools liaison officers.  We have always used our own graduates, young people who have worked in the industry.  This initiative has been immensely successful.  Coming from the hospitality sector, it was sometimes difficult to get into schools that were at the top of the league tables, but when we actually got in, our schools liaison officers did a good job and motivated people, the schools started inviting us back and we started developing relationships with them.  If the overall education and training board, ETB, programme for developing apprenticeships can go into schools and use qualified apprentices, people at different stages who can talk about their experiences, then young people will relate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Phillip Smyth","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542727800,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Regarding Deputy O'Sullivan's questions and comments, it is important to acknowledge and welcome the support that the committee intends to provide in terms of the league tables.  As the Deputy will be aware from her time in the Department, this is something that we have been grappling with for a long time, as it does not reflect the breadth of what we do.  As Mr. Donohoe stated, this is about education options and is much broader than just going to college.  The sector has been challenging the content and the formula that have been used for a long time.<br\/><br\/>We have discussed the young females issue at length and I agree with the comments.  It is good to have sessions like this one where I can leave with actions for the ETBI to pursue alone or in collaboration with partners.  For example, Dr. Smyth mentioned something on which I had just written a note, namely, the transition year programme.  Why can we not pursue that in our almost 300 schools?  It is an action that we could undertake without waiting for anyone else.  That is a positive element that I can take from today.  At the six-month point in the job, it is always good to have ideas to focus on for the next year.<br\/><br\/>On the Chair's questions, ETBs have been fully supported in providing whatever is required to ensure state-of-the-art training facilities.  Sometimes, challenges are encountered in the form of planning permission for change of use if the premises are found.  In the main, however, that has not been a difficulty.  Once a case has been made within the appropriate parameters, agreement has been forthcoming.  Our engagement with SOLAS in that regard has been positive.<br\/><br\/>In terms of the supports that ETBs need, it is probably timely to revert to some of the points that we made at the outset.  The role of authorised officers is crucial to the continuing and future expansion of the apprenticeship model.  In talking to colleagues on the panel, delays can arise with that role.  If the expansion continues at the rate we want, we need the number of authorised officers to grow as well.  ETBs can face challenges where they require experts to deliver their programmes.  Be it during the good times or bad, if people can be employed in their trades or areas of expertise, attracting and retaining suitably qualified staff can be a challenge for us in light of the salary scales.<br\/><br\/>The Chair asked about employer incentives.  It is important to highlight the current supports and incentives that we provide when working with employers.  They may not always be monetary.  For example, we have a centralised unit that provides support for the assessment and development of curricula and we have a mentored training initiative whereby we liaise with employers.  All of this is new for the post-2016 programmes.  We are continuing to work and build on these initiatives.  We have received some positive feedback, learned from it and amended and adapted our approach.<br\/><br\/>Strategic partnerships and changing the apprenticeship model's culture and conditioning have been mentioned.  Through our collaboration with the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, which appeared before the committee last week, on those strategic high-level initiatives, we can make this a pathway for people to choose.  Anything is possible right up to PhD level.  The partners in the sector are open to considering these initiatives.  As Mr. Donohoe stated, bodies sometimes want to mind their own patches and keep what they have, but this is bigger than all of that now and there is a requirement for us to take a wider view<b>.<\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2018112000002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Nessa White"},{"type":"speech","time":1542727800,"counter":254,"content":"<p>I thank Ms White.

Unfortunately, Mr. Damian Allen, who manages the team within the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government responsible for the co-ordination of all matters relating to Brexit, the European Union and international business insofar as it relates to the functions of the Department, was called away on an urgent personal matter and cannot be with us this morning.  I will deliver the opening statement in his absence.  I hope that we will be able to answer any questions members may have on the issues raised.  I have responsibility for building standards.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. John Wickham, who also has responsibility for building standards, Mr. David Kelly, who has responsibility for homelessness and housing inclusion supports, and Mr. Paul Hogan, who led the development and co-ordination of the national planning framework, NPF.<\/p> <p>  I will set out the arrangements in place in the Department for Brexit.  We have a cross-divisional Brexit team, on which all of the departmental functions impacted by Brexit are represented.  It provides a forum in which to discuss Brexit-related matters and is chaired by Mr. Allen.  Brexit-related matters are also kept under regular review by the Department's management board.  Externally, the Department participates in the co-ordination structures established to facilitate a whole-of-Government response.  This includes the interdepartmental group on the EU and Brexit and the Brexit co-ordinators' group.  The Department has been participating in the process of preparedness and contingency planning through these cross-departmental structures, and this process is ongoing. <\/p> <p>  Insofar as the functional responsibilities of the Department are concerned, it should be noted that Brexit issues arise primarily in relation to water, in the context of environmental co-operation and water and marine framework directives; planning, in the context of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, and strategic environmental assessment, SEA, processes; maritime spatial planning; franchise, in terms of voting arrangement; and housing, which is the subject matter today.<\/p> <p>  The extent to which Brexit will impact on the housing market is still uncertain at this point.  It will be determined by the outcome of the process around the withdrawal agreement but also by the nature of the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  However, our analysis to date suggests that the key issues arising for the Department in respect of Brexit and the housing market are in the areas of population and housing projections, construction materials and homelessness.  <\/p> <p>  On population and housing projections, it should be noted that the national planning framework is based on mid-range long-term demographic and econometric projections that do not factor in Brexit-specific impacts, largely because these are highly uncertain.  The key variables for housing demand are the scale of and distribution of population growth which, in turn, are heavily influenced by economic performance.  In the long term, the NPF projects national population growth of around 1 million people by 2040 and the need for at least 550,000 new homes based on continued modest economic growth.  The NPF strategy seeks to focus growth on the regions, in addition to the greater Dublin area.  In the short to medium term, there will be fluctuations in population growth and distribution, as well as in economic performance, and it is possible that Brexit could impact such variability.  In this regard, a long-term strategy is necessary to project growth and influence distribution based on a trajectory that can reflect the net outcome as a whole over a longer period.  The key variable in population change in Ireland is net migration, which is highly volatile, even over short timescales.  Average net migration was approximately 20,000 people per annum into Ireland between 1996 and 2016, but this ranged from a record high of 97,000 people in 2008 to minus 27,500 in 2010, a swing of almost 125,000 people in only three years.<\/p><p>Clearly, Brexit has the potential to create further sharp swings in migration patterns.  However, the NPF strategy is based on net migration of around 20,000 people per annum to 2040.<br\/><br\/>Capacity constraints in the economy in areas such as employment, housing and transport limit the potential for net migration to be sustained at very high levels.  In the face of such uncertainty, however, the Department is currently planning based on a mid-range population growth scenario set out in the NPF, while monitoring evidence of changes in this pattern.  This means the long-term housing requirement remains as projected with short-term variation, for example, to address the shortfall in national output since 2010.<br\/><br\/>I will now address construction products and materials, an area which we are also conscious is very important in regard to Brexit.  Construction products and materials are regulated by EU Regulation No. 305\/2011, which lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products, known as the construction products regulation, CPR.  The primary purpose of the CPR is to break down technical barriers to trade to ensure the free movement of construction products across member states within the European Union.  To achieve this, construction products for which a harmonised European product standard is in force or for which a European technical assessment has been issued need a declaration of performance from the manufacturer and must be affixed with the <i>conformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne, <\/i>CE, marking before they can be placed on the internal market.  In order to affix the CE marking, most construction products require the intervention of a notified body.  Notified bodies are designated bodies that carry out third-party tasks, typically being product certification bodies, factory production control certification bodies and testing laboratories.  The degree of intervention of a notified body in the placing of a product on the market is set out in the technical specifications.  Under the CPR, notified bodies must be established in a member state and be designated by the member state's notifying authority.  The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the notifying authority in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>Post-Brexit, UK manufacturers, distributors and importers of construction products placing products on the Irish market will need to continue to comply with the CPR.  The European Commission issued a notice under the title, withdrawal of the United Kingdom and EU rules in the field of industrial products, confirming this earlier this year.  We disseminated the notice to key industry stakeholders.  All product suppliers who rely on a UK-notified body to support their product declaration for CE marking purposes now need to obtain alternative EU-notified bodies in preparation for Brexit.  At present the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, is the only notified body in Ireland.  It provides certification services to many construction product manufacturers and is working with all the relevant stakeholders on issues arising.<br\/><br\/>As we do not yet know what the eventual outcomes of the Brexit negotiations will be, we are planning on the basis that the UK becomes a third country as of 30 March 2019.  In this regard, it is important that businesses and stakeholders do the same.  We will continue to liaise with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the Irish National Accreditation Board and various industry stakeholders to support them in preparing for potential outcomes of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>On homelessness, it is our strong view that significant increases in net migration would present a concern in respect of increased numbers of households having difficulty in accessing affordable accommodation.  This highlights the critical importance of a number of the Department&rsquo;s programmes relating to increased delivery of all types of homes - social, affordable and private - as well as strengthened regulation of the private rental market and the delivery of additional emergency accommodation for households experiencing homelessness.  Naturally, it is the Department&rsquo;s ambition that increased housing output will be sufficient to meet demand.  However, we are also cognisant of the potential risk in this area and will monitor the position very closely.  Budget 2019 includes significant additional funding for the provision of emergency accommodation and the Department will work closely with the local authorities, which have statutory responsibility in this area.<br\/><br\/>The Department is also working closely with other Departments, both bilaterally and through the structures of the homelessness interagency group established by the Minister last year.<\/p><p>In Dublin, where demand for housing is highest and homelessness is at its highest level, the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, is responsible for the delivery of homeless services across the four local authorities.  Earlier this year, the DRHE established a working group to ensure that robust responses are in place for families and single people presenting to homeless services with uncertainty around their eligibility for social housing supports.  The main focus of the group is to ensure that a collaborative approach between homeless services and the other statutory agencies and Departments involved is in place across the Dublin region.  Brexit is one of the chief issues under consideration by this group.<\/p><p> In conclusion, the Department will continue to keep matters related to Brexit and the housing market under close review and issues arising are being worked through.  In addition to the issues that I have referred to, the Department is liaising with colleagues in a number of other Departments and public bodies on a range of housing issues that may be impacted by Brexit, including issues relating to construction costs, the labour market and potential skills shortages in the future.  We will continue this work.<\/p><p> I thank the committee again for inviting the Department to today's meeting.  My colleagues and I are looking forward to engaging with members on the three issues highlighted, namely, population and housing projections, construction materials, and the potential impacts on homelessness.  We will be happy to answer any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":267,"content":"<p>If we all had a crystal ball it would make life an awful lot easier.  In the context of population projections, net migration of 20,000 is predicted.  In the development of the national planning framework we set a tighter population growth that was contained in the spatial strategy and there was greater headroom capacity in previous county development plans.  Migration can swing from an increase of 97,000 to a decrease of 20,000 over just three years, which is a swing of some 125,000.  We then have to predict what will happen with Brexit.  In a hard Brexit our economy will contract, which would normally mean fewer people come into the country but it might be the opposite in this case and there might be an increase in inward migration.  I think there is to be a six-year review of the national planning framework so there may be more information when that comes around.<\/p> <p>  Ms Neary focused on standards for products and their certification as they come into the country.

One of the problems with the NSS is that following the 2006 census, in the absence of strong regional plans, local authorities examined the short-term trend from 2002 to 2006 and took a view that the significant growth experienced between 2002 and 2006 would continue.  That then gave rise to ambitious plans in the later part of the noughties which meant that by 2010 most of the plans that were extant bore no reflection to the prevailing circumstances post-2008.  That caused a mismatch that has existed up to this day regarding what local authority plans have anticipated and projected with respect to what they have based those on.  They departed, to some extent, from the NSS, which was the problem.  That departure was not corrected until we put the NPF in place.  The NPF's perspective has sought to be longer term.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has correctly identified there will be a formal review every six years.  Given there is so much uncertainty and commentary and also, even compared to years ago, so much information, papers and reports with the latest information, we realise that we need to keep those projections under constant review.  We have talked to the ESRI about putting in place an ongoing level of analysis that would cause us to have a short-term variation and then take a view as to whether it is impacting on the long term.  Until strong evidence suggests otherwise, the long term will remain fixed but we will be mindful of it in the short term because we know there is the capacity for local authorities, in particular, to feel strongly about it.<\/p> <p>  On the impact of Brexit on migration, much commentary and evidence suggests that Dublin, in particular, will remain attractive for people coming to Ireland.  The reality is that cities are attractive to migrants.  Our strategy regarding this is twofold.  We are strong in trying to support our regional cities and towns.  The NPF strategy backs the other cities in addition to Dublin.  It is a very fine balance.  We must be careful about the fact that Dublin is globally important to Ireland but we also want to grow and expand the role of the other cities and towns.  In these current weeks, we are finalising the urban regeneration fund, which will be targeted at larger towns and cities, to encourage investment to make them more competitive and more resilient to the effects of a Brexit-induced recession or a downturn. The bottom line is that there may be a more regional variation in population projections or growth.  We have to target measures to address that.<\/p> <p>  We calibrate anything we do with the ESRI, or whomever, against the CSO information.  We participate in an CSO expert group, which previously met regarding long-term population labour force projections and is due to meet again regarding the starting of a cycle, starting this Friday, on regional population projections.  We have monitored closely and influenced the discussion on regional variation that might be impacted by Brexit because we are concerned about the risk with respect in particular to the Border and north midland counties as opposed to the cities which have proven more resilient.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":271,"content":"<p>Regarding the products, Ireland is a small open economy with strong trade with UK in construction products.

We do not publish those numbers so I cannot give the Deputy the percentage in respect of the construction products used in the residential or housing sector alone, but it is significant.  Any change to either the availability of those products or additional tariffs or currency fluctuations translates into a knock-on effect on construction costs and we are conscious of that.  The tariffs, labour movement and common travel area are all key issues in the negotiation of Brexit.<br\/><br\/>The one function the Department has is that it is the notifying authority for the construction products regulation, CPR.  All construction products covered by harmonised standards must be <i>Conformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne<\/i>, CE, marked when they are put on the Irish market or any other European market.  Nothing will change that.  Products that are being imported by Ireland that rely on a UK third party to certify them, will have to certified by a third party that is notified in some member state for them to continue to be exported here post Brexit.  It does not have to be Ireland; it could be any member state putting products on the market in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU  There is a change for them in the event of a hard Brexit.  If a UK notified body wants to establish itself in Ireland, it must apply to the Department, for example, and we rely on the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, to accredit it for specific standards and in specific areas, whether it is factory production control, testing or whatever it is the body wants to do.  We have had a number of applications from UK bodies.  INAB is working with some of them at the moment.  Once they have been accredited for whatever standards they are requesting they come back to us and there are a number of conditions relating to insurance and establishment in Ireland, and other terms and conditions.  Once everything is in order and we are satisfied, we recommend their notification to Europe.  A process takes place there and if that is successful, the body will become a notified body in Europe, based in Ireland, and it can carry out those functions for its UK manufacturers and place the product on the Irish market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Sarah Neary","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":273,"content":"<p>Have any of them been established yet?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#K00200","speaker":"1357"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":274,"content":"<p>None of them has been but progress is good.

Everyone says there is much uncertainty about Brexit but we are here to discuss its fallout and potential impact on the Irish property sector, which is a broad issue.<\/p><p>There are many challenges both in terms of Brexit but also in terms of our national issues such as housing.  I want to focus on three challenges.  On the need to increase housing supply, we have a national problem, not to mention an international problem.  I refer also to the cost of construction, which is linked to many other issues.  The constraints on infrastructure are a frustrating development <i>per se<\/i>across the spectrum in terms of jobs, affordable housing and so on.  A lack of proper infrastructure will impact on all aspects of construction.  I want to tease out those three issues by asking a few questions.<\/p><p>Ms Neary's presentation deals with the national planning framework, which is based on net migration of approximately 20,000 people per annum up to 2040.  That is not in dispute.  However, Ms Neary then stated there are capacity constraints in our economy in areas such as employment, housing and transport, as we all know, which limit the potential for net migration to be sustained at very high levels.  In the face of such uncertainty, she said, the Department is currently planning based on mid-range population growth.  What does she mean by &quot;mid-range&quot;?  What figures is she talking about?  More people will want to move to cities such as Dublin and the east coast because that is where our industry is located and most of our commerce is done.  The national planning framework, which I support, outlines objectives and targets for infrastructure and development across the country, but much of that is aspiration.  In respect of those key areas, Ms Neary is from the Department.  Can she explain to us how we will increase housing supply to meet the demand, which ties in with our current demand?  I am more interested in the social and affordable aspect of that.  How will we address the issue of reducing the costs of construction?  We know about the potential tariffs and additional forms of taxes that may arise as a result of Brexit.  We know that a high percentage of our construction and building products come from the United Kingdom.  How will we address all of that because it will have a major impact?  Based on our economy and the size of the country, most of those materials are coming from the UK.  What is the Department's plan in that regard.<\/p><p>I mean no disrespect to any of the witnesses but we know most of what is contained in the presentation.  I am more interested in hearing about the proactive measures that will be taken, although I accept it is difficult to plan precisely for that because of the uncertainty of the Brexit issue.<\/p><p>Ms Neary's colleagues would have knowledge of the need for a national infrastructure authority.<\/p><p>That is an important aspect of all of that.  I know they may not be prepared for all of this today, but they might revert to the committee.  <\/p><p> These matters are critical, namely, the increase of our housing supply, the cost of construction and, more important, acknowledging and bringing down the high cost, as well as the serious impact of tariffs and additional taxes post Brexit because at the end of the day someone will have to pay for them.  I will not go into any further detail on the construction of materials because it has been covered.

It is not just a demographic scenario but also a econometric scenario.  It looks at the mid-term economic review and the prospects for the economy, and distributes population with regard to vote demographics, the econometric modelling and places around the country.  Like any model or assessment, it makes assumptions but they are grounded in the likely reality.  When calibrated against the Central Statistics Office, CSO, as a mid-range scenario for long-term population and labour force growth, it more or less correlates with the CSO's mid-range scenario, which is what would be described as the traditional, most likely scenario.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of underlying aspects to that.  First, the number of births and deaths in our population is below replacement levels.  If there was zero net migration, our population would be slowly falling, and that is typical of developed economies.  The birth rate needs to be approximately 2.1% for replacement, but we are at approximately 1.85% and slowly falling.  We are dependent, therefore, on migration for population growth.  <\/p> <p>  In general terms, approximately half of our migrants over a long period tend to be returning Irish people who have lived abroad or started their working careers abroad, while the other half tend to be from elsewhere in the EU, in general, or from the rest of the world.  The capacity to accommodate people in the country, with the level of economic growth and employment we now have, is not endless.  If it was to extend for a protracted period beyond the figures we are talking about, it is clear the capacity would not be there for employment, accommodation and so on for people.  <\/p> <p>  There is an economic equilibrium or a limiting factor in that regard, and that is the sort of consideration that is taken into account when making assumptions for a model to make a projection into the future.  The figure of 30,000, therefore, is considered to be in the upper range.  We should bear in mind that, in projection terms, these are straight line figures.  One presumes a figure of 20,000 or 30,000 every year for the next 20 years, but those sorts of patterns are not the reality.  There will be fluctuations, where it may be lower in the short term, higher in the middle of the period and then lower again, as is the nature of our economic cycle.  All of those things considered, it is a mid-range projection averaged out over the period, and that is how it works.  In regard to the figure of 30,000, compared with what happened in the past, that figure was not exceeded for more than approximately six years during the previous boom, which we do not necessarily expect to be replicated, although it could be.  When put into an average 20 year period, it works out at approximately 20,000.  Based on the information we have, it is felt it is the most prudent way to go.<\/p> <p>  On infrastructure and infrastructural planning, part of the logic of the NPF is to try to identify where investment can be influenced and where people and employment can be influenced by decisions about employment and housing.<\/p><p>The Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have set a sustainable level of investment in infrastructure at approximately 3.5% of gross national product star, GNP*, which is our gross domestic product, GDP, equivalent.  That is seen as sustainable to 2027.  The national development plan, NDP, is based on that level of investment.  It is higher than the European average which is approximately 3% of GDP.  The objective of the NDP is to target that investment where it can be most effective and where it can deliver growth that will make a difference for the regions as much as for Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":290,"content":"<p>Labour and materials are market costs and any changes to those affect the cost of construction.  The negotiations on trade tariffs or labour movement in respect of the common travel area are absolutely critical.  In terms of the Department's role the key area is to make sure that we are helpful in the process by explaining the rules to any organisation that wants to establish itself as a notified body, whether it is a transfer from the UK or a new body, and to make sure we are clear and open about our notification procedures.  That is what we have done.  We have published all our notification procedures.  Any queries are dealt with promptly and we work very closely with the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on that.  We know that they are ramping up the delivery of their services, which is an integral part of that notification procedure.  We are making our industry stakeholders as aware of whatever is developing as much as we can, and disseminating any of the information we get from Brussels to our key stakeholders.  The main one was that the EU said the rules will not change the construction products regulation, CPR, which applies post-Brexit in the same way.  We are disseminating as much clarity as we can so that people know what to prepare for.<\/p> <p>  We are going to have to deal with whatever effect Brexit has on cost or labour.  Construction cost is one element of delivering housing, but land, financing, professional fees, levies, all make up the entire cost of delivering.  We are doing several things on those factors, such as the compact growth in Dublin city and other large urban areas that Mr. Hogan spoke about.  We revised the planning guidelines for apartments earlier this year.  They improved the economics of apartment building and we are seeing an increase in planning permissions and delivery on that front.  Several measures on affordability are being brought forward, the serviced sites fund, which also complements the delivery of affordability, the help to buy schemes and the Rebuilding Ireland home loan all support bringing down costs are part of an effort to reduce the overall delivery costs.  The Land Development Agency and the strategic management of land and the State portfolio, and the Home Building Finance Ireland initiative as well are part of an effort to reduce the overall delivery costs.

We got good coverage at the time.  The rules are very clear under the construction products regulation.<\/p> <p>  We also actively work with the professionals who are specifying products, the registered architects, building surveyors and engineers who sign off on the materials which are incorporated into the construction works.  What we are interested in is that those products are quality and fit for purpose.  In terms of the dynamic that exists between the certification of buildings and the placing of products on the market, we have, through our regulatory system, placed a value on the declaration of performance, which is a key output from the construction products regulation.  It is the obligation on the manufacturer to declare what a product can and cannot do in terms of common technical language that is readily understood by everyone involved.  In targeting the end user with a lot of our seminars and information, we emphasise to them to ask their supply chain for the declaration of performance and make sure that they are prepared for eventualities because it is a declaration of performance which they will rely upon to sign off on building works.  It is quite an important legal document.<\/p> <p>  The notification to stakeholders was issued earlier this year by the EU Commission and we have distributed that information to all within our contact list.  We have had several individual engagements with trade associations on getting a better understanding of the impact it would have for their membership.  I think the rules, as they are stated, are pretty clear in having business continuity.  Those Irish manufacturers that currently engage with UK notified bodies will need to be conscious of making preparations to allow for business continuity should a hard Brexit occur.  Equally, the manufacturers that come from the UK who are importing products into Ireland will also have to ensure they have a notified body that is a legal entity within an EU member state.<\/p> <p>  The NSAI has established a dedicated Brexit unit that is looking at the impacts on the construction stakeholder group, the manufacturers, and seeing where other measures are possible to expand the NSAI's service to accommodate some of the Irish manufacturers that are looking for, essentially, a re-certification.  That is something the NSAI will have under review.  Under the current scope of accreditation, the NSAI is the only notified body that the Department has designated.  As Ms Neary mentioned previously, there is an interest from a cohort of UK notified bodies to enter the Irish market and that will be assessed in due course.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Wickham"},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":295,"content":"<p>Is it the witnesses' contention that the bottom line - the costs of construction - will increase as a result of a hard Brexit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#P00100","speaker":"1416"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":296,"content":"<p>I do not think we can comment on that at present.

These, both the common travel area and any trade tariffs, are key issues in the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement.<\/p> <p>  For our particular area of responsibility in the notification process on that underlying certification of construction products, we are saying \"prepare for a hard Brexit\" which means one must use a notified body established in a member state, be that in Ireland or in Europe.  As Mr. Wickham mentioned, we have had a number of inquiries from UK notified bodies.  Some of them are in the process of going through the national accreditation body.  We have a process, which we have on our website.  Any queries that we get, we answer in a timely fashion in order to support that and make it as easy as possible for these bodies to establish in Ireland and to become notified bodies.

We could spend a great deal of time speculating but our conversation - as with NERI and the ESRI last week - is, accepting the fact that we do not know and considering what contingency plans can be put in place so that if X happens, B can be the response, and if Y happens, C can be the response.  In particular, I was struck by what the ESRI stated last week.  It gave the committee clear warnings in terms of the impact, particularly on private sector supply, if negotiations go particularly badly, hard Brexit or not.<\/p><p>It gave us figures such as, for example, 50% of key building products like electrical components and 30% of timber products pass through Britain.  Obviously there are also the issues of the flow and cost of labour and the potential disruption to the cost of finance.  If I understood the presentation last week correctly, for us they were saying the biggest warning was factors that could slow down the supply of private sector housing.<\/p><p> The departmental officials clearly cannot tell us how much that supply is going to be slowed down until we see it.  What I am not seeing in the written presentation or hearing in the answers I have heard so far is that if supply starts to slow down, as we move through the Rebuilding Ireland and national development plan, NDP, targets, what contingency plans could be put in place or are being prepared to address that.  For example, a portion of the social housing targets in Rebuilding Ireland are local authority or approved housing body builds and acquisitions, and a very large proportion are private sector short or long-term leased.  Meeting those targets requires the Rebuilding Ireland targets to proceed as written in the document.  If private sector supply starts to slow down, that means meeting the housing assistance payment, HAP, rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing targets could be affected.  Is the Department discussing, in that eventuality, shifting funding priorities to ramp up the direct provision of social housing by local authorities and approved housing bodies by a larger quantum than is in Rebuilding Ireland?  That is my first question.<\/p><p> Likewise, in the overall housing system, while I do not necessarily agree with this way of looking at it, it is the Government's policy that increasing supply overall will reduce cost and increase affordability.  If private sector supply is reducing, are there contingency plans, for example, to increase the level of investment in the delivery of affordable housing above and beyond what has already been agreed to absorb some of that shortfall in straight private sector supply?  While I appreciate that some of those contingency planning discussions are Government decisions rather than departmental considerations because they would require increased resources or shifting the allocation of resources, can the Department give the committee any comfort that those are the sort of contingency planning conversations that are happening within the Department and between Departments?<\/p><p> My big fear is that whatever about people's views about Rebuilding Ireland, and we have different views on this committee which we discussed last week, it is not Brexit-proofed.  It was produced at a time such that it is relatively blind to Brexit, and I believe that is a fair point.  Likewise, Mr. Allen's submission today makes clear that population targets in the national planning framework do not take a hard Brexit or a significant Brexit related increase in population movements into account, and it is also likewise with Construction 2020.  Perhaps it is too harsh a phrase to say the core policy documents governing housing delivery are blind in this regard, but they were drafted irrespective of what happens with Brexit.  As I came in, Ms Neary was commenting on Department guidelines and standards, land development agents etc., saying these are all things that would happen anyway.  They are policy objectives in and of themselves as opposed to things that are being produced to Brexit-proof some of the negative scenarios.<\/p><p> My core question is whether contingency plans are being discussed and developed.  Is there a particular focus on what the State will do if private sector supply is disrupted and whether the State can step in, either on the social or affordable side, and increase investment to pick up the slack there?  What comfort can the Department give us that this is where the discussion is at?  I fully appreciate that everything is hypothetical, but the Department and the Government still have to prepare for those hypothetical scenarios, particularly given the very negative impacts they could have on supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#Q00500","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>If Deputy &Oacute; Broin does not mind I will tag my question on to the end of his because I have to go to the Chamber at 12.30 p.m. and then to the Business Committee at 1 p.m.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Tom Healy of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, mentioned to us last week - I am not quoting him word for word &ndash; that in general we have had nearly two decades of a dysfunctional housing market.  The lack of supply in recent years did not just happen.  It came from a blanket dysfunctional housing market.  We cannot just ramp it up in one year or two years.  It is taking time.  Bearing that in mind and in respect of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, we cannot wait for the UK to make up its mind.  We have to plough on with our intention for this country, and this plan is a moving document and presumably adaptable throughout this time.<\/p> <p>  We did a lot of work in this committee on the costs of construction and on universal design, especially when we talked about housing options for older people.<\/p><p>We estimated that the increase in cost of universal design was approximately 3%.  We are doing a lot of work to offset that later.  The cost of materials may go up if tariffs are introduced or maybe they will not.  It is a hypothetical question.  I presume we are looking at other measures to offset costs elsewhere in construction.  We mentioned that many materials are imported from and exported to the UK, specifically 50% of wet materials and, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, 30% of wood.  Dr. Tom Healy also said that we need to diversify more quickly away from oil and fossil fuels.  When it comes to the 2040 plan, I ask Mr. Hogan in particular what key infrastructural plans he thinks are important to push ahead with more quickly than previously planned?  What projects are under way that he thinks will help us through this transition period?<\/p><p> Other matters are probably not within the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I will ask the committee if we can write to the Department of Justice and Equality about work permits.  Have we looked at the processing time to get a work permit for anybody who is from outside the EU?  With regard to the skill shortages that we know we will have into 2020 and 2021, we have looked at many new construction technologies to try to diminish the number of cranes or Manitou equipment or whatever might be on site.  A smaller workforce might be required on site with newer technologies that are available.  I was on site last week though I will not mention where or what.  Are we looking at a wide range of technologies to speed up the process of construction?  Are we putting much into research on construction?  Are we looking at technology in other countries?  While this is probably the business of the Department of Education and Skills, further investment is needed in apprenticeships.<\/p><p> We had the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland at a meeting and its representatives mentioned the ongoing engagement they have with their members here, in Australia, and in Canada, keeping them abreast with what is happening here and, it is hoped, encouraging them to come back here.  What work are we doing to retain talent that we currently have?  It all comes down to viability in the construction sector and providing certainty and consistency for the next ten to 20 years.  I know Project Ireland 2040 is trying to provide it.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that?  I know there was a lot of public consultation for the 2040 plan for over a year.  I know the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has a lot of regular engagement with stakeholders.  What work is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government doing, such as roadshows, to engage with the relevant stakeholders or the Construction Industry Federation?<\/p><p> Unfortunately, I have to leave but I will read the Official Report.

We are constantly trying to build capacity in the local authority and approved housing body sectors to build more.

Let us say 89,000 private sector units were subsidised by the State though the course of Rebuilding Ireland through HAP, RAS and leasing.  We will have around 40,000 real social houses delivered by approved housing bodies and local authorities through builds and acquisitions.

The biggest influence on the capacity for densification or higher density of housing and the ability to provide more housing while maintaining a degree of amenity for people is urban mobility, public transport, walking and cycling.

We need to ramp up our capacity to move people within our cities because that underpins the strategies we have for any increased demand for housing and our capacity to provide more of the type that is needed in the places it is required.

In the event of a hard Brexit, the economy will contract.  At the same time we are talking about net immigration increasing, possibly above 20% because Ireland will be seen as attractive for people from the UK.  This means we will be getting a double whammy.  With a contracting economy, the fiscal space tightens and the private sector delivery will also contract, which puts greater onus on the State to deliver social and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>  Given that we will be in a contracting fiscal space, have we put any emphasis on trying to resolve the State's failure to find an off-balance sheet model to deliver both social and affordable housing?  The great contradiction with Brexit is that, according to predictions, we should have 40,000 job losses in a hard Brexit, so we should resolve our skills shortages in the construction industry fairly quickly.  The whole thing is so hard to predict, but a few things are coming through.<\/p><p>Everybody is saying that if a hard Brexit happens, our economy is going to contract and we could see net migration increasing.  Those two issues would have a negative impact on the housing market, specifically in regard to the private sector, so the State needs to ramp up its delivery in a tightening fiscal space.  The only way to do that is off-balance sheet and we have failed to deliver a sustainable off-balance sheet model to date.

That is what I meant by not separating supply from demand.  In a contracting economy, one would not necessarily expect net migration to increase to the extent that is perhaps assumed.  The reality is the attractiveness of somewhere like Dublin, for example, and maybe the other cities, if we are successful, which we intend to be, could be counteracted by a greater impact in, say, the north midlands or the Border region.  One scenario we are likely to see is that, rather than having an overall issue for the State, there will be greater regional disparity, which is what we are trying to counteract or work against.  In other words, the cities remain resilient and attractive but more peripheral parts of the country, particularly the Border regions, become more challenged.  There is a lot of evidence from the downturn of 2008 onwards that many lower skilled workers migrated elsewhere, not necessarily to the UK but to places like Canada, the Middle East and Australia.  We have 100,000 fewer construction workers now in the country than we had in 2007 and those people still have not come back and are obviously happy living elsewhere.  I do not think we can make assumptions that it will be even across the  State.<\/p> <p>  One of the things that will be important to us post-2020 is the new EU cohesion framework, which is obviously something we have an interest in, as a State, particularly post-Brexit.  One of the key themes of European cohesion is the focus on border regions because, even if there is not something like Brexit between other states, the performance of border regions or peripheral regions tends to be lower than the rest of the state, and that is true in places like France and Germany as much as it is in our own situation.  When one considers the fact we are dealing with what will essentially be a third country as well as our own Border region, we have a strong case for increased cohesion funding under the ERDF.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect of this post-2020 is that the EU wants to focus on metropolitan regions, which ties in very well with its spatial strategy, and it also wants to focus on tying what it calls territorial strategies - in other words, regional planning as we would know it - to funding.  We have already had the right sort of thinking around that.  In regional development terms, we are trying to look to other sources to counteract the likely uneven impact of something like Brexit in the future, which everything we are doing is trying to work against.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#V00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Hogan"},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for attending today and for engaging with the committee.

I am accompanied by Tom Phillips, who is the chairman of Property Industry Ireland, and Mark FitzGerald, who is a member of the PII council.<\/p> <p>  Property Industry Ireland was established in 2011.  One of the reasons for establishing PII was to have an independent and inclusive representative organisation for all sub-sectors of the Irish property industry.<\/p><p>There are also many different stakeholders involved in the delivery of property, from professionals who design and plan development and developers and construction experts who build property to funding bodies, such as banks and investors, and agents who sell and manage properties.  All of these stakeholders are represented in the membership of PII and since the start of 2015, PII has been a sectoral association of IBEC.  Our main mission is to be the trusted partner and provider of evidence-based information, policies and strategies for the property industry at national level.<\/p><p> Effective co-operation between the public and private sectors will be an important means of addressing the deficit in housing supply.  PII estimates that annual average housing demand will be 36,000 units each year for the next 33 years.  I have attached details of how we reached that estimate in the appendix to this submission and we are preparing a briefing document also.  Due to substantial pent-up demand, there is a need to reach an annual output of 50,000 units in the short term.  This estimate is higher than the projection underpinning Rebuilding Ireland 2040 and is based on age and gender specific headship rates from census data which suggest that the number of households in 2051 will be close to 2.8 million, a 60% increase on the 2018 level of 1.75 million.  We are currently building fewer than 20,000 units per annum and this deficit in supply is resulting in issues of affordability and availability of accommodation.  These difficulties are not confined to one segment of the market, but are across all tenures, including owner-occupancy, rental and social housing.  It is the view of PII that the issues facing the housing market are independent of Brexit and need to be addressed regardless.<\/p><p> It is often difficult to assess history as it is evolving but it is our view that the Brexit vote of June 2016 has already had an impact on the Irish property market.  In 2016, Ireland was grappling with a housing crisis that had been accentuated by a failure in 2012 to appreciate the bulge in demographic demand that was likely to occur because of the combination of two separate trends.  The first of these was population growth since 2006 as evidenced in the 2011 census and the second was the economic recovery resulting from the swift administration of austerity policies.  In January 2018, PII published the report entitled, Brexit and Ireland's Property Sector, breand the impacts on housing and the property market that we have observed since the Brexit vote are as follows.  There has been a significant increase in overseas companies, in particular from the USA, seeking to locate offices in Ireland and, in particular, Dublin.  This is leading to a further increase in demand for residential rental property.  There has been an increase in net migration levels into Ireland beyond what had been anticipated.  On the other hand, Irish people who at a generational point normally move back from the UK have encountered difficulties in selling their houses and apartments in Britain, resulting in some tempering of the rise of Dublin house prices.  The analysis of the ESRI and others suggests that the impact of Brexit will be negative on the overall economy and we have seen that activity in the housing market tends to follow that of the overall economy.<\/p><p> One of the main unknowns is what form Brexit and the future relationship between the EU and the UK will take.  This adds to the uncertainty about any impact on migration flows.  If net migration reduces, this will reduce the demand for housing and slow the growth in prices and rents.  However, this does not mean that our housing crisis will be resolved or that prices and rents will fall as such uncertainties in future demand may lead to a decline in confidence, meaning less investment and less overall supply of new homes.  However, higher net inflows would increase demand.  Brexit, including a softer form of Brexit, presents some opportunities for Ireland to attract businesses seeking to maintain access to the EU's Single Market.  This has the potential to be both an opportunity for the property sector in Ireland, as well as a challenge with an ongoing housing crisis and increasing house prices and rents.<\/p><p> Increased foreign direct investment flows highlight the link between the commercial and the residential property sectors.  A concern is that an increase in the demand for residential accommodation will result in higher prices and higher rents in the short run.  Research has found that non-Irish nationals are more likely to rent accommodation when they first arrive in Ireland and that the cost of accommodation is a key factor in the decision of workers to locate here.  Businesses need urgently to see a better functioning rental market.  However, the effect will not be the same across the country.  Brexit-related foreign direct investment represents an opportunity to locate companies in the regions.  While sentiment is difficult to measure, the international political environment may increase Ireland's attractiveness as a location.  As a small country, we have in the past endured many of our citizens being drawn to make their lives outside the State.  However, despite a potentially adverse Brexit and existing shortcomings in housing and healthcare, Ireland has become a desirable country to return to or to come to live in.<\/p><p>That may have a bigger impact on regional Ireland than that envisaged.  The national planning framework is a critically important document which provides a vision that will facilitate spatially balanced economic activity in Ireland.  The availability of funding to support the investment in infrastructure envisaged in the national development plan will be crucial to the success of the national planning framework.  Analysis by PII and IBEC in the report entitled, Better Housing, which we published in June argues that a comprehensive policy response is needed to ensure the supply of a minimum of 80,000 workers which the construction sector will need in the coming years.  More resources are needed to promote and develop apprenticeship opportunities, while the work permit system will need to facilitate increased migration of skilled construction workers from outside the European Union.  Ireland will need to put more effort into attracting workers from European countries and encouraging emigrants to return.  Increased build of new social housing would help to offset some of the uncertainty surrounding the market in the face of Brexit and deliver much better value for money.  It would also help to deliver a more stable market and avoid the volatility seen in the past.<\/p><p> Uncertainty caused by Brexit and uncertainty and caution during any transition period will have a negative impact in the supply of housing.  In order to build, the construction of new homes needs to be viable, but home builders also need some certainty about demand levels.  In the short run, any increase in uncertainty may heighten caution and have a negative impact on supply.  In addition, Brexit-related uncertainty may heighten funders' caution and reduce access to funding for home building, also impacting negatively on supply.  Depending on the shape of the final agreement, there are possible cost implications in the supply of construction materials due to the impact on the supply chain.  Business models may no longer be able to rely on just-in-time delivery.  That, combined with potential additional tariffs, will add to cost of construction.<\/p><p> To summarise, our research paints a challenging outlook for the housing sector, even without having to deal with Brexit.  We accept that it will take a number of years for the market to reach equilibrium.  Lack of supply in the residential property market, both rental and owner-occupancy, represents a key constraint in attracting foreign direct investment into Dublin and the rest of the country.  Improving the viability of home provision is important for the broader economy.  The viability of construction remains an important issue in many locations.  Ireland's housing problems have clearly moved beyond being the social issue of our time and become a risk to future economic prosperity.  A properly functioning housing market is needed to underpin national competitiveness, improve quality of life and address the plight of people in need of homes.  Ireland's housing market has not functioned normally for more than two decades.  Price and supply volatility have negative implications for home buyers, renters and the property development sector.  The attraction and retention of talent is now the single biggest challenge facing Irish businesses.  It concerns business leaders in most regions and sectors of the economy and is particularly acute in the main cities.  Inadequate supply of affordable and quality housing is one of the main factors impacting on the availability of talent.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us.

I am particularly interested in PII, of which I am a great supporter.  I have met Dr. Duffy on many occasions, which gives me a slight advantage because he posed a lot of questions in the past year or two on the occasions I came across him and I have also read some of his publications and corresponded with him.  On behalf of PII, earlier this year he sent key messages and solutions.  I am more interested in hearing how we have progressed in that regard.  I will touch on a few issues, but, first, I acknowledge the important work that he does.  I know that he is affiliated to IBEC as a partner.  As an organisation, IBEC has taken a responsible view in advocating, talking about and dealing with the challenges presented by Brexit across the wide gambit of areas it looks after.  That is important and it plays an important role.  Some people do not always recognise the work it does.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on five key issues, the ones raised by Dr. Duffy in his presentation and of which I am well aware.  The first is how to facilitate an increase in the supply of housing.  Dr. Duffy made a valid and important comment when he said, regardless of the Brexit-proofing of Rebuilding Ireland, that we knew we had a national housing crisis.  That is a problem he addressed.<\/p><p>To facilitate an increased housing supply a point has been made about lowering the cost of construction.  The delegates would have heard the Department's lack of a specific response.<\/p><p> On infrastructural constraints, what are the delegates' views on a national infrastructure authority similar to the bodies in place in New Zealand, Australia and Canada?  Infrastructure constantly comes up as an issue when one talks to IBEC about the roll-out of construction projects, be it industrial or housing.<\/p><p> How does regional development and spatial planning fit into the national planning framework?  I reckon Dr. Duffy is an advocate of the framework from what he has said in the past few months.<\/p><p> Increased competition is an important factor.  What is Dr. Duffy's view on it?  <\/p><p> Another issue about which we have not heard much is the shortage of skills in the construction sector.  It brings challenges with new people coming in, movement in the labour market and the creation of apprenticeships.  What are the delegates' views on the challenges presented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#Y00200","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their presentations and submissions.<\/p> <p>  Accepting the fact that we do not know how things are going to pan out and that we could spend a large amount of time in speculating, the real issue is that there are potential negatives.  Like the ESRI and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, Dr. Duffy has, rightly, pointed to the potential impact on costs, including the cost of finance, materials and the supply of labour and, as a result, the supply of homes by the private sector.  I am encouraged by several of his recommendations, including increasing the supply of new social housing.  However, it is not just the supply of social housing but affordable housing that we need to increase.  If there is a reduction in the supply by the private sector in any way, it will also impact on affordability, irrespective of one's views on the relationship between the two.<\/p> <p>  From Dr. Duffy's engagement with the Government, does he get the sense that contingency planning for Brexit in the context of the supply of housing has been given the same priority as jobs, trade and other aspects?  My own sense is that there has been less of a focus on housing and the disruption Brexit could cause.  Has Dr. Duffy been involved in discussions with the Department or other sectoral organisations on contingency planning?  What changes would need to be made to deal with the matter?<\/p> <p>  The attached paper highlights the need to reduce construction costs.  Our construction costs are not bad.  The Housing Agency study published earlier this year showed that they were broadly comparable with those in other EU member states.  It is non-construction development costs which are causing us difficulty, whether it be the price of land, the cost of finance, taxes, etc.  The report of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland on apartment costs made seven recommendations aimed at reducing costs.  Even if they were all to be implemented, we would still have a viability problem in delivering apartments at prices that would be affordable for families earning less than &euro;80,000 a year.  Which cocktail of policies would Dr. Duffy prefer to see to reduce costs?  Does he believe they would deal with the issue of viability in a benign post-Brexit scenario and, more importantly, a malign post-Brexit scenario?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#Z00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":345,"content":"<p>Many of the issues raised in the questions are interlinked.<\/p><p>It is important, given the projections we have prepared and what we are seeing in terms of output, that we increase housing supply, meaning increase affordable housing supply.  That in itself is interlinked, not with the cost of construction but the cost of delivery, as the Deputy says.  The Housing Agency work shows that Irish construction costs are very similar to European construction costs, and that it is the additional costs on top of that that impact on affordability and viability.  Our view is that, in reducing the cost of delivery, given that the costs of construction are broadly similar, we have to look at those additional costs and be prepared to tackle some of them.  We should look at whether measures can be put in place in terms of the cost of funding and whether something can happen on the issue of levies.  We should also look at the impact of VAT on the cost of delivery and whether it could be reduced, even for a time-limited period, to help the viability of homes and to allow affordable homes to come onto the market.  We have also been supportive of the idea of a national infrastructure authority.  Perhaps Mr. Phillips will speak on that at the end.<\/p><p> Ireland as an economy is facing increased competition.  Brexit, to some extent, is highlighting that because Ireland is being looked at as a possible location for business and being compared with other EU locations.  It is always considered a possible location for businesses, but that is particularly the case at the moment.  The impact of rent and house prices on competitiveness is probably particularly in focus at the moment as people consider where they are going to locate their functions and jobs.<\/p><p> On contingency plans, much of the focus has been on the cost of materials and skills and the impact Brexit will have on those.  The housing market issues are there independent of Brexit.  There is a focus on the housing market issues, and that focus will have to remain regardless of whether Brexit happens.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#Z00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Duffy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Infrastructure was mentioned.

We need to reduce the price of land and increase the amount of land that has been zoned.  There are obviously infrastructure and service costs associated with that, but generally, looking back over the past 20 years, there has been a very cautious approach to public policy and planning.  Obviously there has been a lot of dysfunctionality during that period, but it is clear that we have to bring down the price of land.  If healthcare in general affects the grandparents of this country, housing affects the futures of their grandchildren.<\/p><p>We have to do everything we can to bring in affordable rents and make housing affordable.<\/p><p> We also need to have one body which owns this target.  The country needs a national target for delivery.  Mr. Duffy spoke about how we may need to build up to 50,000 houses per annum.  His projections, based on the 2016 census that is attached to the opening statement and the appendix of this document, is an interesting analysis.  It shows that, 200 years on from the Famine, we will have approximately the same population on the island but will need 60% more houses than we currently have.  I would like to see a body such as the national planning regulator own the target for the annual delivery of housing and be accountable for it.  We need a planning system that works from the bottom up, of course, but also one that works from the top down.  I would like to see those things implemented in terms of housing supply.<\/p><p> On other incentives that might increase supply and moderate prices, the interesting thing is the help to buy scheme.  I can understand that commentators greeted it with a deep degree of scepticism because they thought it might inflate house prices.  The evidence is that it is not increasing house prices but rather is increasing supply.  The average price of a house that people are using this scheme for is now &euro;375,000 or lower.<\/p><p> There are other issues, including VAT.  I would not have advocated moves in that area, but the crisis is so great that if we can reduce VAT to help make house building more viable, particularly apartment building, it would be useful.  The macroprudential rules set down by the Central Bank are a check on any possible inflationary aspects of that.  We need to encourage private, well-behaved landlords to stay in the market and to enter the market.  While the interest relief initiative in the recent budget is to be welcomed, there are other things that could be done.  For instance, property tax might be offset against income.  More private landlords are needed, especially in regional Ireland, and initiatives such as those I have outlined would be welcome at this point.<\/p><p> We have to think bigger.  I agree with the Deputy that public policy takes a cautious approach.  Job creation has tended to dominate the narrative of public policy here rather than house building in recent years.  That is beginning to change now.   Taking a very pessimistic view about Brexit, my fear is that the cautious approach of public policy might become more cautious and we may miss the bigger prize.  If in the year 2000 we had been able to predict what Ireland would be like in 2006, we would have been all the better for it.  If in 2006 we had been able to predict what 2012 would be like, we would have been all the better for it.  If in 2012 we had been able to predict what 2018 would be like, we would have been all the better for it.  We need to look six years and more hence, beyond the immediacy of Brexit, and try to produce a country that has affordable housing for the younger generation coming through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#AA00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>The skills shortage is a big issue for us.  It is not just bricklayers and builders, but other skills that are required for the construction industry, including people like planners.  I lecture in the planning department in UCD.  We went from 50 students a year to five because parents were discouraging their children from getting involved in the construction industry.  There are also people who were builders who were perhaps 48 when the recession happened.  Those people are now 60, and they are not going to return to the building trade.  The skills shortage right across the construction industry is a big challenge.  It is one thing to say that we have to build more houses.  If we get things right on the financial side, it might be the case that we have nobody to build those houses.  We have to ensure that we have the correct educational facilities in place and that the correct encouragement is given to get people back into the trades.  In this I include not just younger people but also older people who have the skill sets and can mentor the younger people.

We also need to consider that, for house building in the private sector to increase, we have to encourage medium and small house builders to enter the market.  Access to finance is a problem for that cohort, and it is a significant issue.

Along with the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, Property Industry Ireland, PII, was the only private sector organisation involved.  We have had quite a lot of consultation, including in the drafting.  It was Property Industry Ireland that came up with the concept of strategic housing development in the first place.

Dr. Duffy spoke about affordable housing supply and the impact on it.  He mentioned something about development levies but did not go into any great detail.  There are building costs and then there are profits for builders and developers.  We clearly have to find the line between those.  I hope Dr. Duffy is not suggesting any reduction in development levies.  Development levies are ring-fenced with specific purposes in mind.  That does not necessarily relate to the development itself.  The witnesses know how the development levy scheme works and is apportioned.  I know people have difficulty with it, but the other side of that is that local authorities rely on development levies.  We could have a whole session about development levies and the people who have not paid them.  If one looks at the Dublin local authorities one sees that vast debts of outstanding development levies are owed to them.  There are a variety of reasons for that.  The levies are there for a purpose, namely the common good.  The overall development of sustainable communities is really important.  It is a tricky issue and one that concerns me.  Perhaps Dr. Duffy might touch on and outline what he meant.  Is he talking about a temporary suspension or various reliefs for specific projects?  I would be interested to hear what he says about that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Fitzgerald talks about not enough land being zoned.  I was a councillor for many years in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and we were constantly told that too much land was zoned.  They were preventing land from being zoned.  I am talking about land between the N11 and the M50, not beyond the M50 or below that area.  These were what we would today call major infrastructure or transport corridors, places that made a lot of sense.  I cannot understand it when people talk about a lack of zoned land.  Most local authorities, certainly those in Dublin, Galway and Cork, have vast tracts of land.  There are vast tracts of land in State ownership.  We have touched on the State's portfolio before.  There is a real need for a very in-depth analysis of the State's real estate portfolio.  Every day I am involved in this I realise that the State does not know its own assets.  Local authorities seem to have a difficulty in identifying them, as do the State and the Department.  That is a major concern.  The witnesses might touch on this.  I do not know where Mr. Fitzgerald gets the idea that not enough land is being zoned.  Professional planners are told there is enough.  The Department tells some local authorities they have more than enough land.  Whenever a councillor proposes rezoning there is a suggestion they are up to something shady.  That is the way it has gone.  We now have a situation where local authority members are finding it very difficult to propose zoning.  All sorts of motives are attributed or suggestions made about their commitment to forward planning.  Mr. Fitzgerald might talk about that briefly. <\/p> <p>  Finally, I am very interested in what Mr. Fitzgerald has to say about a single body for the delivery of the social housing targets.  I would have thought that was the Department itself.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  Why is the Department insisting on that?  Ultimately, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is the key Department that drives this.  It is the Department that comes before this committee and goes on national media to talk about rebuilding Ireland and setting targets.<\/p><p>The problem is that no one is quantifying.  We have no independent validation of the figures and statistics on construction and the roll-out of social and affordable housing, or any housing construction.  Do the witnesses have anything in mind?  Have they seen a model anywhere else?  Could they tease out the situation a little bit more?  It makes sense that we have accountability.  Why are we not delivering?  Why are we hearing day in and day out about targets but no one is delivering them?  What model or what body is Mr. Phillips thinking about?  I invite him to share that with us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#CC00300","speaker":"1379","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the answers.  In response to Mr. Phillips, my question was not so much about the quality of PII's relationship with the Department, because we would hope it is the way he described, as it should be with all external bodies, it was more specifically about whether in those conversations there had been a discussion of the contingency plans to try to deal with some of the risk we are talking about.  While it is very important for us all to monitor those risks and be aware of the sliding scale of risk, the real question then is for those Departments and Ministers who have responsibility as to what contingency plans they are putting in place.<\/p> <p>  With respect to what Mr. FitzGerald said about land, there are two concerns.  There is a growing body of work around housing by land economists that would suggest that increasing the supply of land would not do anything to reduce the cost.  Because land is always finite, the cost is more determined by the availability of finance and the desire of finance to seek out certain kinds of secure investments.  Therefore, we could significantly increase the zoning of land and have the opposite effect, that one would start to push up the cost of land because speculative investment would get involved.  Is there evidence to counter that view that is now held by many economists?<\/p> <p>  Like Senator Boyhan, I am in South Dublin County Council and we have more than enough residentially zoned land to meet current and future housing need as projected under the census targets.  That is both public and private land.  In fact, if we were to accede to zoning more land in that local authority area it would be contrary to Government policy, which is about trying to focus residential development back into town and city centres, for all sorts of very positive reasons.  I am not against zoning land if there is a credible argument for it, in particular to boost housing supply, but I would caution against it.<\/p> <p>  Is there a concern about the Land Development Agency, given that the Government's main vehicle for addressing the need for finance by the small and medium sized builder, namely, Home Building Finance Ireland, is still delayed and we have not seen any lending from it?  That does seem to be the primary policy response.<\/p> <p>  I wish to refer again to the two studies of construction and development costs by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  In the second one about apartments, it identified a suite of policy measures which it believes the Government should consider to reduce costs.  If we were to introduce all of those, namely, reducing car parking, reducing apartment size, reducing development levies and VAT, reducing the cost of finance and reducing the cost of land, it still would not fix the viability gap that the society identified in terms of the overall development costs of apartments, and providing homes at affordable prices for working families.  When I hear people talk about reducing VAT I would be more than open to supporting it if I thought it would genuinely reduce the cost of units.  However, in the very best case scenario, it might take &euro;10,000 or &euro;12,000 or &euro;18,000 at the very most off the cost of a residential unit in Dublin, one which is already costing between &euro;320,000 and &euro;340,000.  It does not improve its affordability for the working families that are locked out of private sector purchasing at the moment.  There is also no legally enforceable way of ensuring the developer passes that on.  One cannot give a VAT reduction under EU law to houses of a certain price.  One can only do it, for example, for a new house rather than a second hand house.<\/p> <p>  In this committee we look at all of the proposals, but I have still not heard how we deal with the situation other than how we tackle, for example, the cost of land.  Unlike Senator Boyhan, I am more than happy to waive development levies if that is knocked off the purchase price of a house and somebody can buy a genuinely affordable home.  That is what happened with &Oacute; Cualann in Poppintree and it was part of the cocktail of financing that made those homes affordable, but those homes were being sold at &euro;170,000 to &euro;225,000, so it is in that context that I think there is a public good to be got in return.  I would have lots of sympathy with Senator Boyhan if it was being said that the development levies were to be knocked off a house that is &euro;320,000 because one is only knocking &euro;12,000 off the cost of the house and one is not getting any public good in return.  More work needs to be done by the likes of the witnesses who are advocating cost reductions because when one looks at the detail of them, I am not convinced they stack up.<\/p><p>Help-to-buy is the same.  A more generous interpretation of the scheme in the Indecon report states the jury is out on whether it has contributed to house price inflation.  Even from this report, we know at least 60% of those who availed of the scheme did not need it.  They already had deposits and were already buying houses at a price that they did not need the 5% tax refund.  I am not convinced from the limited evidence available, as it is a relatively new scheme, that it contributes to affordability for those who need it or it has not contributed to house price inflation which is a concern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#DD00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":360,"content":"<p>Mr. Tom Phillips said he has a good interaction with the Department and input into Rebuilding Ireland.

This shortfall will have a significant impact in the future and the Brexit situation will add to that.<\/p> <p>  The regional spatial and economic strategy for the Eastern and Midland Region Assembly has just been published.  There were problems with the Department regarding population targets and, as a result, the zoning of land.  It took a significant consultation with the Department which then sent an email on the Friday the strategy was published stating there was no need to downzone land.  This was a factor in Wicklow town.  The Department saw a large reduction in headroom in the town which would lead to a significant dezoning of land in areas which had the infrastructure in place to deliver housing.  In Wicklow town, &euro;100 million was already invested in infrastructure.  In fairness, the Department counteracted that.<\/p> <p>  Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the collection of development levies.

At the time it was introduced it made my business viable.  I do not believe I would have survived the crash without it.  Does Mr. Mark FitzGerald believe the proposed reduction of VAT for the construction sector should be on a viability basis or for making housing more affordable?  Housing is demand led.  The greater the demand, the higher the price.  VAT does not make an impact for the house purchaser when there is high demand.  For small and medium-sized construction companies, the 4.5% margin from a reduction from 13.5% to 9% would have an impact as they cannot access any credit, particularly those building outside Dublin.<\/p><p>There are small and medium-sized enterprises around the country which could deliver 20 or 30 houses tomorrow morning if they could get access to credit and increase their margins to make it more viable.

Large-scale developments are not a solution on their own.<\/p> <p>  On the measures needed to improve the cost of delivery, the surveyors' report illustrated clearly that there is no silver bullet.  A range of measures across funding, finance and the cost of land is needed to address the cost of delivery.  In the housing market, which is sentiment-driven, the help-to-buy scheme is playing an important role by giving more confidence about the demand levels that are there.  Confidence about demand results in confidence about supply and because homebuilders know demand is there, they are prepared to deliver houses.  Moving from phase one to phase two has been quicker as a result.  The other impact of the scheme, about which I heard through interaction with some of our members, is in the way certainty of demand has brought about certainty of funding, which has helped deliver supply.  The scheme could be a demand-side measure but it is probably having more of an impact on the supply side by bringing that certainty.<\/p> <p>  There are probably a number of reasons for the difference in population projections.  The 2025 estimate was probably based on the 2011 census while the 36,000 is based on the 2016 census.

We are not looking for a blanket omission of levies but equitable levies.  There are 31 planning authorities and 31 different sets of levies.  Sometimes, different sides of a road have different authorities for levies, such as at Walkinstown roundabout in Dublin.  Those levies are passed on to the purchaser and the developer has to make a profit margin to get bank finance.  He or she will not get 100% finance as they did in the past.  Any levies that are applied by the local authority end up going onto the cost of a house and it is not just a matter of a &euro;13,000 reduction.  The levies are at 13.5% so a house costing &euro;300,000 will have a VAT levy of nearly &euro;40,000.

If a person is part of an industry, he or she has to go through the red door, as it were, and say he or she has something to declare.  That is self-apparent.  Where we are trying very much to come from is in the public good.  The context of the way we are approaching this problem is that we are looking backwards, and we only look backwards to learn what we should do in the future.  In the 1971 census, I think, there were 700,000 houses in Ireland and, according to Dr. Duffy's figures, we have about 1.7 million occupied houses in Ireland and, again by Dr. Duffy's figures, we will go to 2.8 million by 2051.  In the next 25 to 30 years, we need to see as much change in housing in Ireland as we have in the past 50 years.  That is the context of the proposed initiatives we are suggesting.<\/p> <p>  Philosophically, looking at the public good, at the moment we have a policy of controlled containment.  What we probably need is a policy of controlled enablement.  On the zoned land issue and why more land should be zoned, there is fairly good international research from a New Zealand body, which I can share with the committee, that studied many global cities and shows that zoning more land actually does work.  It is an 80 page document that is worth reading because we would hope it answers some of the questions the committee is talking about.<\/p> <p>  Looking back even five years, at the end of 2012, Property Industry Ireland was asked by the Secretary General of the Government to attend a meeting with representatives of NAMA and local authorities about the housing crisis that was emerging.  It was not perceived to be the crisis that it is now, but it was emerging.  At the time, the Minister of State had made a speech saying we had enough land zoned to build.  In advance of that meeting, we went around Dublin and looked at every scheme that we thought could be built the following year, comparing the theory with the reality.  We turned up at the meeting and showed the difference between the theory and reality of what was going to be built.  Unfortunately, what we predicted came to pass.  At the time, part of the initial figures was that 2,000 houses could be built in 2012 and 2013 in Adamstown.  It was not physically possible to build 2,000 houses in 2013 in Adamstown and, even if a person did, he or she would not be able to sell them.  That is the difference between theory and realty.  One has to look.<\/p> <p>  We are interested in bringing the price of land down because we think it will bring the price of housing down.  If a profit is going to be made in the private sector, it is probably more in the public good that the profit is made on the building of the house rather than on the land.  We probably all agree on that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of owning a target, we live in a world where people have to take responsibility and those who do need to be held to account, while the people who do the holding to account need to behave responsibly.  I really do not mind who owns the target, but my point is that somebody should own the target.  The reason I mentioned the national planning regulator was in light of the National Roads Authority, NRA - it is called a different name now &ndash; which was quite successful in owning and delivering something.

In looking at land markets, for example, in European or OECD countries over the past 30, 40 or 50 years, the less taxes we placed on land and the less restrictive the markets in land, the greater the price rises and price volatility.  It seems we have forgotten that part of the reason we have, for example, development levies as distinct from VAT is that they are a way for the local authority, and therefore the population, to capture some of the value increase in land that comes from everything surrounding it.<\/p> <p>  There is also a value in thinking about how we constrain the rising values of land.  For example, in Adamstown, and Clonburris beside it, there is no shortage of residentially zoned land.  Our difficulty has been either lack of finance or lack of purchasers because of lack of income to meet the cost.  Part of the difficulty in those areas is land prices.  A significant developer has bought a very large piece of agriculturally zoned land in the same local authority area just across the road from Clonburris and Adamstown.  While the argument will be that this is about increasing the supply what we will see is the value of that land, and therefore the ultimate price of the houses, will rise rather than reduce if that land is rezoned.  That is not an argument against zoning.  It is merely that one of the bits of the economy we understand least is land.  We have lost the ability to understand what influences the price.<\/p> <p>  It is the same with supply.  There are growing bodies of evidence that show increasing the supply of housing, in and of itself, does not reduce the cost because the cost of housing units is not only determined by the numbers of buyers.  It is also determined by the cost of land, the cost of finance etc.  In the Celtic tiger period, when housing output was at the highest level in the history of the State, the number of families on the local authority waiting list and the number of families dependent on subsidised private rental accommodation also dramatically increased.  This was because, despite the fact that we were producing between 60,000 and 90,000 houses over three years, the price of housing, both in terms of renting and buying, also increased.  I am not saying supply is not important.  I am saying the simplified idea that merely increasing the supply, as a result of making it more viable for developers, will automatically result in affordability is flawed and we need a more informed debate about how we make sure we not only increase supply but at the same time increase affordability.  Here is the problem.  If we do not do that, the other section of the organisation these guys work for will have a different problem, which is, because they cannot get affordable housing, they will be demanding increased wages which will affect the viability of businesses and the competitiveness of the economy as well.  That is why some of these debates are too limited.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Casey is correct.  Of course, reducing VAT increases the viability of the development because if one knocks &euro;10,000 or &euro;15,000 off the VAT of that &euro;320,000 price, that goes into the pocket of the developer, if that is the way the developer plays the reduction.  In fairness, the Central Bank and some of the larger banks have advocated this as a supply viability measure, not as an affordability measure.  My concern is, if we keep reducing the ability of the State to invest in the infrastructure that people need around those houses by reducing the tax take and at the same time there is no increase in affordability, that is not a good deal for the public overall.  While it might be a good deal for individual developers and increase supply, it is not necessarily the kind of supply that we need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#HH00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542711600,"counter":374,"content":"<p>I see the way the market works and the way different markets intersect with each other.  I will give a practical example.  If we were to proceed to build more houses in Naas, the increase in supply in houses in Naas would have the impact of making houses on the ring-road of Dublin a bit more affordable because people would have an option that bit further out.  Then if we keep the houses on the ring-road more affordable, it means that when we develop in the inner city where we want to try to develop, the price on the ring-road, because it will be an option for people, will keep the price in the inner city more affordable instead of having very expensive houses.  How the markets intersect with each other is important.  Public policy does not quite get that.<\/p><p>I accept that there is a risk that, if not managed properly, an increase in zoning can have inflationary impacts on certain services.  When I began taking an interest in housing at approximately 15 years of age in the late 1960s or early 1970s, I used to look at the <i>Evening Press<\/i>, which was full of ads for houses all over the country.  The prices of houses across the country, whether in Ballincollig in County Cork, Salthill in County Galway or Lucan in County Dublin, were approximately the same.  There was a significant amount of supply because the land was zoned.  The process may not have been what it ought, but there was a significant amount of supply and choice.  At that time, the market worked and people were able to get a house and a mortgage and have a family.<br\/><br\/>The zoning of more land could be managed in a clever way such that while a development plan would be put in place, a person could still put forward a business case for the rezoning of ten, 20 or 30 acres which were not zoned but were close to services.  That would allow a certain amount of flexibility in that such logical zoning could be granted.  That would impact on the inflation of other land in the contiguous area.  That is how it should work.  The way it is managed is important.  I accept that it is quite difficult to manage markets in an efficient and equitable way in a public process system.  However, that would be a reasonably clever and adroit way to increase land supply while achieving the objective of helping to reduce the price of land.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018112000002#HH00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mark FitzGerald","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542711600,"counter":376,"content":"<p>What happens between the time land is zoned and a development is completed is key.

The granting of planning permission may increase the value of land, after which it may be flipped.  Although I agree that the zoning of land should be examined, we should also consider how zoned land is developed and whether there should be timeframes in that regard or significant penalties for landowners who flip land rather than developing it.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge Mr. FitzGerald's comments on development levies.  There are many local authorities with different development contribution schemes, all of which are based on different infrastructure in the county development plan of each authority.  The current process was put in place in 2004.  It identified a significant historical lack of infrastructure which it attempted to compensate for, as well as the infrastructure that would be required in the future.  That led to development levies of approximately &euro;25,000 if one was building in Greystones or Wicklow town in County Wicklow because we were trying to deal with historical deficiencies in infrastructure and also plan for the future.

If we do not approach such a policy in a coherent way, it could have unintended consequences.  Currently, we are not building houses and the price of land is going up.

The committee has received my opening statement.  Rather than reading it in its entirety, I will highlight a few points from it.  There are two parts to the statement, the first of which deals with support for the Irish language within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the second of which deals with Irish language services in early years settings.<\/p> <p>  I would like to begin by referring to our response to the questionnaire of February 2017.<\/p><p>I acknowledge and apologise that our response was rather minimalist at the time and it did not offer the committee a full picture of the various measures that we were taking.  We have recently submitted an updated and expanded version of the questionnaire which I hope the committee will find more informative.  Since completing the original questionnaire we have undertaken a good deal of work to increase the supports and the services provided in Irish by the Department and this was informed by a review of the Department's language scheme undertaken by an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga in 2017.<\/p><p> We have acted on an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga's recommendations following his review of the Irish language scheme and I will summarise some of those points.  Some 20% of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs' press releases this year were provided simultaneously in Irish, compared to the 10% promised in the Irish language scheme.  We launched a new website recently and we have considerably increased the number of pages translated into Irish on same.  About 52% of all the pages are in both languages.<\/p><p> We do not have a high level of direct contact with the general public through Irish but we are committed to supporting the availability of Irish to the public.  We have six officials in the Department, ranging from service officer level to principal officer level who are fluent in Irish and can engage with the public through Irish.

We have facilitated and continue to facilitate Irish training and staff also have their own informal caife le Ghaeilge once a fortnight.  We will continue our efforts to encourage and support the use of Irish in the Department, trying to encourage an Irish language friendly atmosphere throughout.<\/p> <p>  On the early years segment, we are strongly committed to supporting the provision of services in Irish to children at an early age.  We fund some 228 services which identify themselves as na&iacute;onra&iacute;, both within and outside Gaeltacht areas and about &euro;16 million was invested in same over the last four years.<\/p> <p>  At a practical level, we have an early years forum to advise the Minister on all aspects of early years and we have allocated two places for Irish language stakeholders as well as having a specific subgroup of the forum from time to time for promoting Irish medium early childhood services.  We also have six staff members from Better Start, which is the quality initiative within Pobal, who are proficient in Irish.  They have provided support for about 135 na&iacute;onra&iacute; in the quality context and have provided support for our access and inclusion model for children with special needs.<\/p> <p>  We are very supportive of the five year action plan for the Irish language which was produced by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and we have committed to a set of important actions under the action plan in the early years area.  These include providing information and supports for parents raising children through Irish and we are about to create two new Irish language posts next year, one in non-Gaeltacht areas and one for quality under Better Start.  The job specifications have been finalised and the funding is in place for 2019.<\/p> <p>  We will participate fully in the overall monitoring of the five year action plan and we will also have our own specific group, which we will lead, to monitor the specific commitments in the early years sector.<\/p> <p>  Yesterday, the Taoiseach, with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, launched a major early years strategy called First Five, which is for babies, young children and families.  This is a milestone policy for early years and it contains two actions that are specifically aimed at supporting the development of the Irish language within the early years sector.  One is to ensure that children in Gaeltacht areas have access to Irish-medium early learning and care and the second is to develop mechanisms to provide the Irish language supports where there are a significant number of children learning through Irish.  There will be an implementation plan for all of the actions in the strategy within six months.<\/p> <p>  There are many other aspects to the supports that we can and should be providing.  I hope that my summary and the opening statement will have provided a reasonable overview to the committee of the Department's work in this area.

I fully agree with the importance of ensuring that children from a very early age have the opportunity to learn both languages and specifically to learn Irish.  As to being able to bestow that present, the best way to put it is that we have tried in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to support as much as we possibly can the provision of Irish throughout the country, with a particular focus on Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht areas, where they have expressed a particular interest in it.  Our focus has tended to be on services as a whole, because we felt and still feel that they are, by international comparisons, poorly supported.<\/p><p>There has been significant investment in them over the last number of years, with some 117% increase in the investment overall in childcare services over the last four years.  The strategy launched yesterday aims to double that investment over the next ten years.  Our focus has been on expanding and developing the provision of early years services throughout and within that to provide as many supports for early years through the Irish language as we can.  The major way we have tried to do that is through the five year action plan that was launched last year with the specific recommendations and actions set out in that, and equally the actions that I mentioned earlier in relation to First Five.  We wish to support that as much as we possibly can although inevitably our focus in the Department, because early years services have been in such need of investment, has been to concentrate to a good degree in supporting all services, whether they are provided through English or Irish.  This has been done through things like increased investment, increased capitation payments, programme support payments for administrative costs, capital supports and sustainability funding where services run into difficulty.<\/p><p> It is true to say that we have attempted to support all services, but having particular regard now to the need to develop services that wish in turn to provide those services in Irish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018112000002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542729600,"counter":436,"content":"<p>An bhf&eacute;adfainn dul ar ais ar&iacute;s?

The groups I was talking about were the monitoring group convened under the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for the five year action plan.  I was not referring to the early years forum, which is yet another structure so that monitoring group and that early years focused monitoring group are actually new structures directed at that five year action plan under the 20 year Irish language strategy.  I apologise if there was confusion about that.  The strategy for that monitoring group was launched in Killarney three weeks ago and we had our first meeting on the day of the launch.  The early years group will be meeting for the first time before Christmas.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is right that when Deputy Zappone became Minister, she established an early years forum to allow her to communicate with the whole early years sector and there are two Irish language groups on that.  Several subgroups were set up to tease out issues in greater details and Irish was one of them and we have some detail on what came out of that group.  It probably met between four and six times, as did the other subgroups.  I was not actually involved with it.<\/p> <p>  We can talk the committee through the recommendations that came out but I was talking about having had meetings with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Foras na Gaeilge and all of the rest of them earlier and how there was a little bit of confusion and inconsistency around what was being asked for coming out of it.  That came up in the forum subgroup and it was a very good place to tease out issues but ultimately its best benefit was that officials in my area were talking to our colleagues in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht about the five year action plan, which became the main vehicle.  The real benefit of having had the conversations in the early years forum setting was to inform our conversations around that.  It is given its ultimate expression in the five year action plan and the 14 specific early years actions that are contained in the language transmission by the family section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018112000002#H01500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Fay"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1542729600,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I note that one of the recommendations of that subgroup talked about the need for an Irish medium early years co-ordinator based in a Department.  There were various other recommendations in relation to supports through development officers and so on but what has emerged from that is the fact I mentioned in my opening statement, namely that we are recruiting two early years, Irish medium officers, one of whom will be working in non-Gaeltacht areas and one of whom will be working with Better Start.<\/p><p>The subgroup of the forum informed that particular development, for which there is funding available for these posts next year.<\/p><p> The other question was about the Department's funding of these services and whether there is extra money for early years when providing these services through Irish.  Currently there is not.  It is a question of whether we should, from a policy perspective, employ some form of positive discrimination.  So far we have not done that.  We have concentrated on a major issue for us, namely affordability right across the country.  The second major issue is quality and making sure that whatever we fund is of a high quality.  The third issue is access.  We have focused on affordability, quality and access.  We have not, so far at least, moved in the direction of providing additional services for particular areas such as Irish language.  Who knows but this may happen in the future.  I made the point earlier that we have been so far behind the curve, so to speak, by comparison to other countries, that we have been concentrating on increasing investment overall, which we have managed to do, over the last number of years.  I mentioned a figure of a 117% increase in the last four years and plan to double investment in early years settings overall in the next ten years.  That may be something that could be examined in the future.  Currently our focus is on developing all of the early years right throughout the country, irrespective of language.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SCL2018112000002#H01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Fergal Lynch","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1542729600,"counter":477,"content":"<p>T&aacute; c&uacute;pla ceist agam.  &Eacute;ir&iacute;onn an ch&eacute;ad cheist as &aacute;bhar na hearca&iacute;ochta agus an bheirt at&aacute; le fost&uacute; an bhliain seo chugainn.

The two posts we are recruiting are specifically highlighted in the action plan.  They are mentioned because that are designed to be co-ordinator posts.  What we find is that we have 30 sitting county childcare committees operating throughout the country to support early years service provision and there is a level of support tr&iacute; Ghaeilge in most of them.  Obviously it is stronger in the Gaeltacht areas than further outside.  They are independent companies which operate like this.  There are pockets of good practice going on.  There are services which are doing things on their own and there are initiatives going on in learning institutions through training and support.  It is not centrally co-ordinated and it is not brought together and there is no sharing of the learning.  The two specific posts we are talking about are designed to identify good practice and to give us the base line and then to start building on that.<\/p> <p>  I should have mentioned earlier that the early years' specific group under the action plan will have two purposes.  It will monitor the 14 early years' actions we have but it will also be seeking opportunities to increase the use of Irish throughout the country in and outside the Gaeltacht.
