I will be brief.<\/p> <p>  As members know, the Bill is very short.  Its main purpose is to give members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  When enacted, it will allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to avail of the broad suite of WRC services, including mediation, conciliation and adjudication, as well as those of the Labour Court in the event of an industrial relations dispute involving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p> <p>  The Bill forms part of the ambitious four-year plan for implementation of the recommendations outlined in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  Accordingly, it recognises the Garda Commissioner as the employer, instead of the Department of Justice and Equality.  As such, for the purposes of the Bill, the Garda Commissioner will have lead responsibility in engaging in discussions on pay and conditions.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the Bill is very short.  It contains just five sections and makes a small number of legislative amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  The amendments primarily affect sections 3 and 23 of the Act which include certain definitions such as those of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a worker and an employer.  The Bill also extends the concept of what constitutes a contract of employment in the context of trade disputes involving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <\/p> <p>  A schedule to the Bill seeks to actively disapply certain provisions of industrial relations legislation, particularly as they apply to the ability of garda&iacute; to take industrial action, engage in strike action, etc.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make some introductory remarks about the Bill.  I welcome whatever contributions Members may have to make on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019041700002#A00500","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1555516800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill as an important step.

As he is probably aware, my colleagues Deputies David Cullinane and Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh introduced a Bill in April 2017 to allow members of the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be classified as workers under legislation and give them the option of forming trade unions.<\/p><p>The purpose of the Trade Union (An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces) Bill 2017 was to allow the representative associations in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to reconstitute as trade unions, if they so wished, thereby giving them full access to the State's industrial relations mechanisms, while making it illegal for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces to engage in strike action for reasons of public safety and national security.  Rulings made by the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe, the increased level of industrial action engaged in by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the continued negative treatment by the State of members of the Defence Forces in their pay and conditions were among the reasons Sinn F&eacute;in introduced its Bill.  The continued ban on trade unions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces is in violation of international agreements and the fundamental rights of those employed in the sector.  <\/p><p> The Bill which has been brought forward by the Minister of State has a similar, albeit considerably more limited, aim.  It seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to allow members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their representative associations to access the State's industrial relations mechanisms, namely, the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Garda&iacute; have been waiting too long to be allowed access to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  Internal disputes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na escalated owing to the unavailability of a forum in which to address conflicts at an early stage.  While long overdue, the Bill is very welcome.  <\/p><p> Sinn F&eacute;in believes members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces should be allowed to join a trade union, if they so wish, and that members of the Defence Forces should also be allowed to access the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court in the same way garda&iacute; will be permitted to do under the Bill.  Will the Minister of State clarify if there is a particular reason members of the Defence Forces are specifically excluded under the Bill?  As I said, while the Bill is very welcome for the changes it introduces for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it is far more limited than what is proposed in Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill.  We intend to bring forward amendments to the Bill on Report Stage to strengthen the rights of garda&iacute; and members of the Defence Forces.  <\/p><p> I would like the Minister of State to address the following questions.  Why will members of the Defence Forces not be defined as workers under the Bill?  If it is for the Minister for Defence to decide if members of the Defence Forces will be allowed access to the WRC, will the amendments submitted by Sinn F&eacute;in concerning Defence Forces personnel be allowed to be discussed or ruled out of order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JES2019041700002#A00700","speaker":"1327","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1555516800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Technically, the Minister of State does not have to respond to Deputy Quinlivan's questions at this stage.
