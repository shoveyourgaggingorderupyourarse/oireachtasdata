No apologies have been received.<\/p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of the spread of Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving about the campus or within close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to all public health advice.  <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to examine its 2020 financial statements.  At the committee&rsquo;s request, the board has included briefing material on the following matters which may be examined during the course of the meeting: the status of the implementation of recommendations made in the report, entitled the organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the independent review group, dated February 2016; judicial reviews of the board&rsquo;s decision, including the overall number; and how many are decided, how many were successful and the status of live cases.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has provided a briefing note in relation to details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p> <p>  We are joined this morning by the following officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. Dave Walsh, cathaoirleach, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Mr. Graham Doyle, secretary general, and Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division. <\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p> <p>  Before we move to the opening statements, and in the context of the reminder that I just read out, it is important that members are aware there are number of ongoing inquiries that focus on alleged conflict of interest and governance issues at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To avoid the risk of prejudicing these investigations, as well as other potential proceedings that may follow from their conclusion, members must respect the fact that the review of decisions of the board is a matter for the courts.  Because members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the House either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, I will not permit members to question or comment upon specific matters that are subject to the inquiries.  <\/p> <p>  While we have requested information in relation to judicial reviews on the board&rsquo;s decision and details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of the boards, discussions on these matters should focus on systems, processes and should avoid discussion of specific cases or individuals.  <\/p> <p>  To begin I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As members are aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible under the Planning and Development Acts for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.

I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to assist in its examination of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s financial statements for 2020, and to discuss the board&rsquo;s important work as well as recent progress in delivering on our statutory mandate.  We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can, but, with the committee's indulgence, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters that may be raised during the session because they may be more familiar with such matters.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined, it important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual cases.  To do so could compromise decisions or, indeed, various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can.  While not strictly relating to the 2020 financial statements, I might take the opportunity to briefly outline to the committee the nature and status of a number of ongoing reviews, although, unfortunately, I am not in a position to elaborate much more on these matters and processes while they are ongoing.<\/p> <p>  In recent months, a number of issues and allegations have arisen in respect of potential conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of board systems and procedures.  I fully recognise the seriousness of these issues and the potential damage that these allegations have done to the board&rsquo;s reputation for integrity, independence and impartiality.  I have commissioned a team of senior managers to examine any issues arising, with a view to identifying areas which may require improvements in relation to the suitability and effectiveness of existing controls, procedures and systems which are designed to manage potential conflicts of interest and related matters.  I will take whatever actions and implement whatever reforms may be necessary and appropriate to strengthen our systems and procedures in order to ensure that they are as legally robust and fit for purpose as possible and practicable, and with a view to maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the board&rsquo;s decision-making processes.  In the same context, I will also take account of any outcomes and proposed recommendations from the ongoing review being undertaken on behalf of the Minister, as well as the targeted review of the board&rsquo;s systems and procedures proposed to be undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator later this year.<\/p> <p>  As committed to as part of its five-year strategy, the board is currently reviewing its code of conduct and any outcomes or recommendations arising from these reviews will be integrated into the code review process, which is expected to be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.  The board is well aware of its critical role within the planning system, in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals and we remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities and I can confirm that the board considers itself generally in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee, internal audits as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, the board had a total income of just over &euro;26 million in 2020, primarily comprising an Exchequer grant of &euro;19.25 million and fees revenue of just under &euro;6.8 million.  This represented an increase from 2019, when we received &euro;18.6 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over &euro;5.4 million in fee revenue.<\/p> <p>  To give the committee a little background on the organisation, the board currently has just over 191 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving resource requests, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and major infrastructure projects.  The board is currently engaging with the Department in respect of an updated workforce plan for the period 2022-23 to meet its evolving needs and current and future work demands.  The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely manner, in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as considering local planning policies and the observations from the public and prescribed bodies.<\/p> <p>  While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2020 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using more current statistics that we have to hand.  These last couple of years have been very challenging for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as they have been for many other organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which we are still experiencing and managing with the latest wave.  However, despite these disruptions, the board has been able to keep our public office open in a safe manner through the pandemic phases and was also able to maintain a consistent throughput of case decisions.  We adapted our practices to enable online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings,and facilitated hybrid office and home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements and advices for both staff and the public.<\/p> <p>  In 2021 the board saw a substantial increase in the overall number of cases lodged, with a total of 3,251 received, up 18% on the previous year.  The number of cases decided by the board in 2021 was up just under 6% on the previous year&rsquo;s total, with 2,775 cases decided.  While some of these increases maybe attributed to the return to normal business following the extensive Covid-related disruptions during 2020, there has also been a marked increase in activity in the planning sector, reflecting the increased residential development activity, as well as wider economic activity across a range of sectors.<\/p> <p>  On normal planning appeals, the compliance rate with our statutory objective period, SOP, for 2021 fell back to 58% from the 76% recorded in 2020.  This was due to a confluence of factors including the significant rise in case numbers received, reduced staffing capacity arising from the impact of Covid with isolation periods, absences, changes in work practices with ongoing restrictions and managing staff capacity including filling vacancies and covering sick leave in a very challenging environment.  With the significant volume of cases on hand at the end of 2021 and ongoing disruptions from the latest Covid waves, it is proving a significant challenge to reverse this downward trend and return to more acceptable levels of compliance this year.<\/p> <p>  In the first six months of this year, there has been continued strong case intake with almost 1,600 new applications and appeal cases lodged and some 1,350 cases disposed.  With the significant backlog of cases and prioritisation given to housing and strategic infrastructure cases, the SOP compliance for normal appeals has dipped further to 44%, but we are exploring all options to improve our performance and are working hard to get back to higher compliance levels with the SOP as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  In respect of SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and just over 100 cases were decided in 2021, with all but one of these determined within the 16-week statutory timeline.  Of these, the board granted permission in 76 cases and refused permission in 25.  There is still a significant volume of applications within the system that will continue to be determined over the coming months, while the new large-scale residential development, LRD, process is already up and running with the local planning authorities.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the board saw a jump in strategic infrastructure applications received in 2021, with 30 applications lodged, up from 24 in 2020, and 30 cases decided, up from 19 in 2020.  The total of 74 pre-application consultation requests during 2021, 24 more than were lodged in 2020, indicates a significant ramping up of major complex applications being considered and proposed.<\/p> <p>  Amid all the Covid-related disruptions, the pandemic provided us with a valuable opportunity to facilitate a greater online and digital offering to staff and the general public.  The board&rsquo;s case management system enabled remote working for all staff, and the ongoing development of the board&rsquo;s online capability was extended during the year to enable observations on planning appeals and strategic infrastructure cases, as well as SHD cases, to be made through our web portal.  The online submission option is a key step in the board&rsquo;s plans to provide more online services such as virtual oral hearings and ultimately the online receipt of applications and appeals over time.  I also welcome the launch of the board&rsquo;s new website which is another step in providing more user-friendly and accessible information to all who avail of our services.  Working closely with the local authorities&rsquo; e-planning initiative,I am hopeful that we will see further phased roll-out of online services over the coming months and into 2023.<\/p> <p>  The significant increase in the volume of legal challenges to board decisions during 2020 has continued in 2021, with 83 new cases in 2020 and 95 in 2021.  These applications for judicial review of the legality of decisions involve significant detailed legal scrutiny of complex matters of procedure and interpretation relating to European Union environmental directives and other issues arising from the strategic housing development application process.<\/p><p>All of those cases are dealt with by the superior courts, that is, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and questions relating to the EU law elements can be referred from those courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union for adjudication.<\/p><p> Legal costs for representation before the courts are substantial, and there has been a significant escalation of such costs in both 2020 and 2021.  Our gross legal costs were &euro;8.4 million in 2020 and are currently accounted for at &euro;7.7 million in our draft unaudited financial statements for 2021.  These legal costs are split between our costs for solicitor and barrister representation and payments for undersigned costs in instances where the case is lost or conceded.  In respect of the latter, it is accepted that in 2020 and 2021, legal case outcomes revealed a significant number of losses and concessions, amounting to 32 in 2020 and 40 in 2021.  The board is conscious that it needs to continuously review its procedures and approaches to certain matters, having regard to legal judgments and ongoing advice from its legal advisers, with a view to ensuring its decisions are as legally robust as possible.  This process is ongoing but it is still the case that certain areas of planning law remain open to various legal interpretations and are, therefore, still contentious and complex.<\/p><p> When considered appropriate, the board has, in a small number of selected cases, sought to appeal certain decisions to the relevant appellant courts.  In terms of costs, the prevailing statutory context around planning judicial reviews is that the board is made liable for applicant costs where it loses or concedes a case but generally does not have its own costs awarded against judicial review applicants where it successfully defends the legality of its planning decisions.<\/p><p> I will leave it there instead of taking up more of members' time.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

Normally speaking, one would expect to see a development start within two years but we were concerned at the beginning of Housing for All that many of the permissions are not turning into housing.  That is why there are a number of actions in Housing for All dealing with issues around viability, such as the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities scheme, with the provision for the first homes launched during the week.  There are also broader issues regarding cost of construction because many of the strategic housing developments are very large and they tend to be apartments.<\/p><p>We know that the costs of building them are quite high.

People wonder whether the developer is doing it deliberately in order to be constrained.  It deeply upsets the local community.  If an even slightly softer approach were taken, people would be on board because they want to see the development of housing.  It is just a little pushy and aggressive.  If there are nine storeys instead of seven in an old, established residential area, people become very upset.  Councillors make all these observations at local level and the application goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. Walsh might respond as to how many times applications of that nature have been varied by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be more consistent with the local environment.  My major concern, having gone through that process and with people being very clearly upset, is that we still need houses but I do not see them getting built.<\/p> <p>  I investigated some of this in my area.  Ms Graham is right about cost and that is one issue, but why are we spending time on applications without being sure these things can in fact be built?  Is there any measure of consideration given on that side?  The significant amount of State time, energy and cost to assess the applications, including local energy and investment and the role of the local council, is one thing.  Difficulties with Irish Water come up again and again.  There is then the matter of judicial reviews.  I have spoken to developers to try to weed out what the specific issues are, either with the council or Irish Water.  Why are they not developing in the area I represent where I know people need housing?  Judicial review comes up again and again.  I have no difficulty with residents associations, or people directly affected who have been involved in a process or are adjacent to it, taking judicial reviews, but my question relates to judicial reviews being taken where the applicant had not been previously engaged or involved in any sense.  Does Mr. Walsh have any sense of the proportion of judicial review applications where an applicant had not been involved in any way prior to taking such an application? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#M00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>On the first question on how many times the board has varied designs or decisions, I cannot say because I do not sit on every single case.  We do not track whether a floor has disappeared or a block is amended.  Sometimes they are subtle and sometimes not, but each case is assessed on the basis of its particular location and its proximity to other developments.  It is very difficult to say that a five-, three- or seven-storey building here will not have the same impact as a seven-storey building somewhere else.  Judgments and assessments are made on the basis of a building's impact on daylight and sunlight, including in respect of its future occupants.  We often think about what is happening for properties and people who are living in the area already, but one of the key considerations is what the quality of life and space and size are.  Do they meet the minimum requirements?  Do people get enough sunlight and daylight into their amenity space or balcony?  I am aware and have sat in meetings where there have been instances where not only have we removed some floors, as recommended either by the planning authority or the inspector, but in some respects we have removed some blocks, particularly on a larger scale, where we feel open space is at more of a premium.  The board has the scope to make those amendments and to look at it, but our job is not to redesign the thing to make it right.  Where we feel those additional measures can address the key concerns and requirements around standards, that is an option open to the board.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question on parties who may not have participated in the process, judicial reviews are generally taken by people who have engaged, either as an observer in the local authority or as an observer and submitter in the board's direct applications.  That is a requirement for someone to then take a judicial review.  It is irrelevant to the board whether they are raising major or minor issues.  If somebody makes a valid submission and observation on an application or appeal, that person is party to the decision and will get the due consideration that everybody else will get.  Obviously, if the individual only identifies one issue or talks about compliance with EU law, that is as much a consideration as whether it has an impact on amenities in a residential neighbourhood.  That is the practical approach.  I am not sure if that addresses the Deputy's question.

The Deputy mentioned public confidence and the understanding of the system.  It is important that over the past three or four years, the challenge and complexity around what the board has been dealing with in relation to SHDs primarily relates to the fact that national policy, that is, the national planning framework, NPF, and national guidelines have moved far more quickly than some of the local plans.  The board is looking at national as well as local policies.  It has to try to balance and assess whether the local plans, which predate the national planning framework or the apartment guidelines, fit in with those.  We are now at a point where because most of the planning authorities' new development plans are being updated to take account of the NPF, the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and all the new updated guidelines, there will be far less need for the board to materially contravene many local plans because they are not in line with national policy.  Many of the issues to date, and much of the controversy or concern, arise from the fact we have someone looking for something that is outside the density or height levels.  When the new plans come through, that will make it clearer.

We had never had a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I had concerns.  All the actions have been listed as either \"complete\", \"ongoing\" or \"to be determined\".  What is the breakdown?  There is also a note saying a number of issues cannot be dealt with until the review of Housing for All is complete because there is a legislative capacity on that, which I understand because I have asked about it in the D&aacute;il.  However, there have been six years in between.  There are so many issues here that have never been dealt with.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la sent its inspector - no doubt an eminently qualified inspector - to adjudicate on that decision when that decision was appealed by the telecommunications company.  The inspector produced a detailed 34-page report upholding the decision of Monaghan County Council.

This provision would be as envisaged in the Aarhus Convention, that the court is used after the local authority and the other appeals' routes have been exhausted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05000","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":908,"content":"<p>On the amendment yesterday-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>The piece about correcting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Would I be right in saying that it would allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to change its decision after it is challenged by a judicial review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Consideration is being given to further minor issues such as a typo or something that is inconsistent and that kind of issue, rather than a substantive change.

That is for 2021.<\/p> <p>  The second set is from the Mental Health Commission, again for 2021, and this received a qualified audit opinion.  The accounts, in my view, give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, and that is standard for many health bodies.  It is in the nature of a technical qualification there and it is only qualified in regard to that point.<\/p> <p>  There are nine sets of financial statements that come from the National Treasury Management Agency stable, if you like, and it has a very broad remit.<\/p><p>The first one is the accounts of the national debt of Ireland for 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.  The next one is the administration account for the National Treasury Management Agency.  These are the expenses of the organisation.  There is a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Next is the Post Office Savings Bank Fund for 2021.  It is a clear audit opinion.<\/p><p> The State Claims Agency received a clear audit opinion for 2021, but I do draw attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control that there were a number of erroneous payments made in 2021 to service providers due to the agency's manual payment processing.  The service providers returned the payment so there was no net loss, but still it was a control failing.<\/p><p> Next is the Dormant Accounts Fund for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) for 2021 received a clear audit opinion, but that is a nil account where there is no balance in the account at the moment.  No. 9 is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.  No. 10 is the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This is a fund that is now dissolved, and these are the final accounts for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The Ireland Apple Escrow Fund for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.<\/p><p> Moving on from the NTMA accounts, No. 12 is the Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla.  For 2021 it received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to the disclosures that are made in the accounts on material non-compliant procurement and the implications for Tusla of the cyberattack on the HSE's ICT system.  Tusla relies on support from the HSE for its ICT system.<\/p><p> The next one is the Cork Education and Training Board.  These are the financial statements for 2020.  It received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to disclosures about material non-compliant procurement, which occurs in other ETBs.  I also drew attention to significant delay and additional costs incurred by the board on a capital project for the building of an extension to one of its schools, due to the failure of the first appointed contractor in December 2017.  Last week, when the Department of Education was here, Deputy Murphy drew attention to that kind of situation.  There is another ETB coming forward where I draw attention to a similar problem.  Undoubtedly, there is or has been an issue there.<\/p><p> The final one for noting this week is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":931,"content":"<p>This might be because I am a relatively new member, but I was just wondering when was the last time the Mental Health Commission was before the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#DD00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I do not remember it being here in ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":933,"content":"<p>Could I make a request that, while I note it has a clear audit opinion, in terms of governance and good operations it would be very helpful to get the Mental Health Commission in for a review?

There is this moratorium where they have all started to be nice to each other to try to limit claims and, for that reason, they backed off putting in counterclaims.  There are other triggers.

I imagine it will probably compare fairly favourably with the pharmacy we have in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  This committee has a role to play and this follows on from Deputy Catherine Murphy's point.  We need to get clarification in the here and now, from both the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as to what measures and provisions they are putting in pre-contract and pre-tender to ensure we can say, in the same way almost anybody else in the world can, that when a contract is signed, this is how much the project will cost.  It does not need to be kept secret if it is defined in the contract, or if there are provisions that say it will potentially go to this cost if X, Y and Z happen or it could be less if A, B and C happen.  That is the way contracts are supposed to work when we are talking about construction.  We did not have that in respect of the national paediatric hospital.  That is why we are still figuring out three quarters of the way through building it how much it will actually cost.  It has not happened in far too many other areas so it must happen here.  If it does not, and we end up in a situation where the Committee of Public Accounts in ten or 15 years is having the same conversations about this hospital as we are about the national paediatric hospital, one will have to say it is time to bloody take down the whole system and start again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#GG01000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>To follow on from the previous Deputy, I think it will be hard for us to get to a number.  In light of the saga of the paediatric hospital, however, it is totally valid for us to ask what the clauses are in the tender, how that tender process is working and what we can do in that regard.  When it comes to the numbers that are being bandied around, and I put this to the Minister at the time at the Joint Committee on Health, the proposed building is 55,000 sq. m.  Health buildings at the moment cost approximately &euro;5,000 per sq. m.  Even with massive inflation, we are talking about a base cost of approximately &euro;275 million.  If we add in, let us say, one third for commissioning and one third for fees, we are still nowhere near &euro;800 million, which is what we were talking about at the time of the decision-making.  I do not know where we got to &euro;1 billion, but even &euro;800 million was a huge inflation.  I do not know how we got there.  When I put that to the Minister, I really got no answer to that.  It was said that is what had been reported in the media.  I would really like to understand this.<\/p> <p>  I know the decision has been made now.  I believe it has all been signed off from a project quality index point of view.  At the time of the decision, however, the business case had not been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It had been set out but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform refused it and sent it back.  I would love to understand and it would be really important for the Committee of Public Accounts to understand where the business case is right now.  Has it been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  What is that situation?<\/p> <p>  There is an issue around spending when there has been no agreement.  That is terrible in terms of public money and governance.  I do not think we should ever accept that.  To spend &euro;50 million or &euro;90 million - we are not even taking the number seriously now because it is all just a figure in taxpayers' money - when we do not have an agreement in place is atrocious.<\/p> <p>  Finally, if we are going back to the Department of Health to ask for information, particularly now that we are talking about Spanish hospitals and stuff, as I did at the time I would like to flag the fact that a scoping exercise for the maternity hospital was done on the Elm Park site in 2012.  There is a fully built hospital that has been empty for ten years sitting on the Elm Park site.  My understanding is that the scoping exercise found it was suitable for a maternity hospital.  The National Maternity Hospital did that scoping exercise and it found that it was suitable for a maternity hospital and for its needs.  I would love to see that report and for the Department of Health to release that report in order that we could see that scoping exercise.  My understanding is that the building is still empty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#GG01100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>There are a number of parts here, the first of which being that we will note and publish the correspondence in front of us.

This is precisely the issue I was trying to draw attention to.  If we compare our approach in the Republic to that taken in Northern Ireland, it is possible to walk into the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, PRONI, which is in a lovely new building constructed in the Titanic Quarter, and to look at the Land Commission records there.  They are not digitised, but it is possible to go in and to look at them.<\/p> <p>  We have a 100-year rule on records but these documents seem to be an exception to this rule.  The Department has said that these are working records and fragile.  This is all the more reason, though, for why they would be digitised.  This is a useful item of correspondence but I still think we should respond in turn and ask why we do not have a similar approach to these records, in the context of the 100-year rule not applying, and why there is a different approach in Northern Ireland to making the Land Commission's records there available.  I ask this question because this information is a treasure trove.

In its correspondence, Benefacts set out 94 instances of data provision to public, private and non-profit bodies between 2016 and 2021.  Regarding its funding, the organisation has stated that it proposed that it be funded under the Teckal procurement exemption.  The committee has been provided with a copy of the advice regarding the feasibility of instituting these arrangements from the professional firm that prepared it.  Benefacts states that its board received no response to its proposal from the Department, nor was there any other opportunity to discuss alternative institutional, financial and governance arrangements.  It goes on to state that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSenior officials in the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development advised Benefacts that they would not consider taking over responsibility for funding the company because they regarded Benefacts as a source of &ldquo;massive procurement risk&rdquo; [...] Notwithstanding this, the Department appears to have asked Pobal to explore the feasibility of providing a service that is on the face of it very similar to one of those already developed, tested and launched by Benefacts [...] even though of course Pobal is a provider to the State of what are by definition public goods under the Teckal exemption <\/blockquote> <p>It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to request the consent of Benefacts to also publish its correspondence.

Therefore, we should seek the response that Benefacts could not get from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the last paragraph of the correspondence in question, it relates to the same aspect of a market good.
