No apologies have been received.<\/p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of the spread of Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving about the campus or within close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to all public health advice.  <\/p> <p>  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House. <\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to examine its 2020 financial statements.  At the committee&rsquo;s request, the board has included briefing material on the following matters which may be examined during the course of the meeting: the status of the implementation of recommendations made in the report, entitled the organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the independent review group, dated February 2016; judicial reviews of the board&rsquo;s decision, including the overall number; and how many are decided, how many were successful and the status of live cases.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has provided a briefing note in relation to details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. <\/p> <p>  We are joined this morning by the following officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. Dave Walsh, cathaoirleach, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Mr. Graham Doyle, secretary general, and Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division. <\/p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. <\/p> <p>  Before we move to the opening statements, and in the context of the reminder that I just read out, it is important that members are aware there are number of ongoing inquiries that focus on alleged conflict of interest and governance issues at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To avoid the risk of prejudicing these investigations, as well as other potential proceedings that may follow from their conclusion, members must respect the fact that the review of decisions of the board is a matter for the courts.  Because members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the House either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, I will not permit members to question or comment upon specific matters that are subject to the inquiries.  <\/p> <p>  While we have requested information in relation to judicial reviews on the board&rsquo;s decision and details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of the boards, discussions on these matters should focus on systems, processes and should avoid discussion of specific cases or individuals.  <\/p> <p>  To begin I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#A00600","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":10,"content":"<p>As members are aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible under the Planning and Development Acts for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.

I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to assist in its examination of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s financial statements for 2020, and to discuss the board&rsquo;s important work as well as recent progress in delivering on our statutory mandate.  We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can, but, with the committee's indulgence, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters that may be raised during the session because they may be more familiar with such matters.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined, it important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual cases.  To do so could compromise decisions or, indeed, various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can.  While not strictly relating to the 2020 financial statements, I might take the opportunity to briefly outline to the committee the nature and status of a number of ongoing reviews, although, unfortunately, I am not in a position to elaborate much more on these matters and processes while they are ongoing.<\/p> <p>  In recent months, a number of issues and allegations have arisen in respect of potential conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of board systems and procedures.  I fully recognise the seriousness of these issues and the potential damage that these allegations have done to the board&rsquo;s reputation for integrity, independence and impartiality.  I have commissioned a team of senior managers to examine any issues arising, with a view to identifying areas which may require improvements in relation to the suitability and effectiveness of existing controls, procedures and systems which are designed to manage potential conflicts of interest and related matters.  I will take whatever actions and implement whatever reforms may be necessary and appropriate to strengthen our systems and procedures in order to ensure that they are as legally robust and fit for purpose as possible and practicable, and with a view to maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the board&rsquo;s decision-making processes.  In the same context, I will also take account of any outcomes and proposed recommendations from the ongoing review being undertaken on behalf of the Minister, as well as the targeted review of the board&rsquo;s systems and procedures proposed to be undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator later this year.<\/p> <p>  As committed to as part of its five-year strategy, the board is currently reviewing its code of conduct and any outcomes or recommendations arising from these reviews will be integrated into the code review process, which is expected to be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.  The board is well aware of its critical role within the planning system, in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals and we remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities and I can confirm that the board considers itself generally in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee, internal audits as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, the board had a total income of just over &euro;26 million in 2020, primarily comprising an Exchequer grant of &euro;19.25 million and fees revenue of just under &euro;6.8 million.  This represented an increase from 2019, when we received &euro;18.6 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over &euro;5.4 million in fee revenue.<\/p> <p>  To give the committee a little background on the organisation, the board currently has just over 191 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving resource requests, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and major infrastructure projects.  The board is currently engaging with the Department in respect of an updated workforce plan for the period 2022-23 to meet its evolving needs and current and future work demands.  The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely manner, in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as considering local planning policies and the observations from the public and prescribed bodies.<\/p> <p>  While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2020 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using more current statistics that we have to hand.  These last couple of years have been very challenging for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as they have been for many other organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which we are still experiencing and managing with the latest wave.  However, despite these disruptions, the board has been able to keep our public office open in a safe manner through the pandemic phases and was also able to maintain a consistent throughput of case decisions.  We adapted our practices to enable online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings,and facilitated hybrid office and home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements and advices for both staff and the public.<\/p> <p>  In 2021 the board saw a substantial increase in the overall number of cases lodged, with a total of 3,251 received, up 18% on the previous year.  The number of cases decided by the board in 2021 was up just under 6% on the previous year&rsquo;s total, with 2,775 cases decided.  While some of these increases maybe attributed to the return to normal business following the extensive Covid-related disruptions during 2020, there has also been a marked increase in activity in the planning sector, reflecting the increased residential development activity, as well as wider economic activity across a range of sectors.<\/p> <p>  On normal planning appeals, the compliance rate with our statutory objective period, SOP, for 2021 fell back to 58% from the 76% recorded in 2020.  This was due to a confluence of factors including the significant rise in case numbers received, reduced staffing capacity arising from the impact of Covid with isolation periods, absences, changes in work practices with ongoing restrictions and managing staff capacity including filling vacancies and covering sick leave in a very challenging environment.  With the significant volume of cases on hand at the end of 2021 and ongoing disruptions from the latest Covid waves, it is proving a significant challenge to reverse this downward trend and return to more acceptable levels of compliance this year.<\/p> <p>  In the first six months of this year, there has been continued strong case intake with almost 1,600 new applications and appeal cases lodged and some 1,350 cases disposed.  With the significant backlog of cases and prioritisation given to housing and strategic infrastructure cases, the SOP compliance for normal appeals has dipped further to 44%, but we are exploring all options to improve our performance and are working hard to get back to higher compliance levels with the SOP as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  In respect of SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and just over 100 cases were decided in 2021, with all but one of these determined within the 16-week statutory timeline.  Of these, the board granted permission in 76 cases and refused permission in 25.  There is still a significant volume of applications within the system that will continue to be determined over the coming months, while the new large-scale residential development, LRD, process is already up and running with the local planning authorities.<\/p> <p>  Similarly, the board saw a jump in strategic infrastructure applications received in 2021, with 30 applications lodged, up from 24 in 2020, and 30 cases decided, up from 19 in 2020.  The total of 74 pre-application consultation requests during 2021, 24 more than were lodged in 2020, indicates a significant ramping up of major complex applications being considered and proposed.<\/p> <p>  Amid all the Covid-related disruptions, the pandemic provided us with a valuable opportunity to facilitate a greater online and digital offering to staff and the general public.  The board&rsquo;s case management system enabled remote working for all staff, and the ongoing development of the board&rsquo;s online capability was extended during the year to enable observations on planning appeals and strategic infrastructure cases, as well as SHD cases, to be made through our web portal.  The online submission option is a key step in the board&rsquo;s plans to provide more online services such as virtual oral hearings and ultimately the online receipt of applications and appeals over time.  I also welcome the launch of the board&rsquo;s new website which is another step in providing more user-friendly and accessible information to all who avail of our services.  Working closely with the local authorities&rsquo; e-planning initiative,I am hopeful that we will see further phased roll-out of online services over the coming months and into 2023.<\/p> <p>  The significant increase in the volume of legal challenges to board decisions during 2020 has continued in 2021, with 83 new cases in 2020 and 95 in 2021.  These applications for judicial review of the legality of decisions involve significant detailed legal scrutiny of complex matters of procedure and interpretation relating to European Union environmental directives and other issues arising from the strategic housing development application process.<\/p><p>All of those cases are dealt with by the superior courts, that is, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and questions relating to the EU law elements can be referred from those courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union for adjudication.<\/p><p> Legal costs for representation before the courts are substantial, and there has been a significant escalation of such costs in both 2020 and 2021.  Our gross legal costs were &euro;8.4 million in 2020 and are currently accounted for at &euro;7.7 million in our draft unaudited financial statements for 2021.  These legal costs are split between our costs for solicitor and barrister representation and payments for undersigned costs in instances where the case is lost or conceded.  In respect of the latter, it is accepted that in 2020 and 2021, legal case outcomes revealed a significant number of losses and concessions, amounting to 32 in 2020 and 40 in 2021.  The board is conscious that it needs to continuously review its procedures and approaches to certain matters, having regard to legal judgments and ongoing advice from its legal advisers, with a view to ensuring its decisions are as legally robust as possible.  This process is ongoing but it is still the case that certain areas of planning law remain open to various legal interpretations and are, therefore, still contentious and complex.<\/p><p> When considered appropriate, the board has, in a small number of selected cases, sought to appeal certain decisions to the relevant appellant courts.  In terms of costs, the prevailing statutory context around planning judicial reviews is that the board is made liable for applicant costs where it loses or concedes a case but generally does not have its own costs awarded against judicial review applicants where it successfully defends the legality of its planning decisions.<\/p><p> I will leave it there instead of taking up more of members' time.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dave Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Walsh.

Normally speaking, one would expect to see a development start within two years but we were concerned at the beginning of Housing for All that many of the permissions are not turning into housing.  That is why there are a number of actions in Housing for All dealing with issues around viability, such as the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities scheme, with the provision for the first homes launched during the week.  There are also broader issues regarding cost of construction because many of the strategic housing developments are very large and they tend to be apartments.<\/p><p>We know that the costs of building them are quite high.

People wonder whether the developer is doing it deliberately in order to be constrained.  It deeply upsets the local community.  If an even slightly softer approach were taken, people would be on board because they want to see the development of housing.  It is just a little pushy and aggressive.  If there are nine storeys instead of seven in an old, established residential area, people become very upset.  Councillors make all these observations at local level and the application goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. Walsh might respond as to how many times applications of that nature have been varied by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be more consistent with the local environment.  My major concern, having gone through that process and with people being very clearly upset, is that we still need houses but I do not see them getting built.<\/p> <p>  I investigated some of this in my area.  Ms Graham is right about cost and that is one issue, but why are we spending time on applications without being sure these things can in fact be built?  Is there any measure of consideration given on that side?  The significant amount of State time, energy and cost to assess the applications, including local energy and investment and the role of the local council, is one thing.  Difficulties with Irish Water come up again and again.  There is then the matter of judicial reviews.  I have spoken to developers to try to weed out what the specific issues are, either with the council or Irish Water.  Why are they not developing in the area I represent where I know people need housing?  Judicial review comes up again and again.  I have no difficulty with residents associations, or people directly affected who have been involved in a process or are adjacent to it, taking judicial reviews, but my question relates to judicial reviews being taken where the applicant had not been previously engaged or involved in any sense.  Does Mr. Walsh have any sense of the proportion of judicial review applications where an applicant had not been involved in any way prior to taking such an application? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#M00200","speaker":"1480"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":495,"content":"<p>On the first question on how many times the board has varied designs or decisions, I cannot say because I do not sit on every single case.  We do not track whether a floor has disappeared or a block is amended.  Sometimes they are subtle and sometimes not, but each case is assessed on the basis of its particular location and its proximity to other developments.  It is very difficult to say that a five-, three- or seven-storey building here will not have the same impact as a seven-storey building somewhere else.  Judgments and assessments are made on the basis of a building's impact on daylight and sunlight, including in respect of its future occupants.  We often think about what is happening for properties and people who are living in the area already, but one of the key considerations is what the quality of life and space and size are.  Do they meet the minimum requirements?  Do people get enough sunlight and daylight into their amenity space or balcony?  I am aware and have sat in meetings where there have been instances where not only have we removed some floors, as recommended either by the planning authority or the inspector, but in some respects we have removed some blocks, particularly on a larger scale, where we feel open space is at more of a premium.  The board has the scope to make those amendments and to look at it, but our job is not to redesign the thing to make it right.  Where we feel those additional measures can address the key concerns and requirements around standards, that is an option open to the board.<\/p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question on parties who may not have participated in the process, judicial reviews are generally taken by people who have engaged, either as an observer in the local authority or as an observer and submitter in the board's direct applications.  That is a requirement for someone to then take a judicial review.  It is irrelevant to the board whether they are raising major or minor issues.  If somebody makes a valid submission and observation on an application or appeal, that person is party to the decision and will get the due consideration that everybody else will get.  Obviously, if the individual only identifies one issue or talks about compliance with EU law, that is as much a consideration as whether it has an impact on amenities in a residential neighbourhood.  That is the practical approach.  I am not sure if that addresses the Deputy's question.

The Deputy mentioned public confidence and the understanding of the system.  It is important that over the past three or four years, the challenge and complexity around what the board has been dealing with in relation to SHDs primarily relates to the fact that national policy, that is, the national planning framework, NPF, and national guidelines have moved far more quickly than some of the local plans.  The board is looking at national as well as local policies.  It has to try to balance and assess whether the local plans, which predate the national planning framework or the apartment guidelines, fit in with those.  We are now at a point where because most of the planning authorities' new development plans are being updated to take account of the NPF, the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and all the new updated guidelines, there will be far less need for the board to materially contravene many local plans because they are not in line with national policy.  Many of the issues to date, and much of the controversy or concern, arise from the fact we have someone looking for something that is outside the density or height levels.  When the new plans come through, that will make it clearer.

We had never had a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I had concerns.  All the actions have been listed as either \"complete\", \"ongoing\" or \"to be determined\".  What is the breakdown?  There is also a note saying a number of issues cannot be dealt with until the review of Housing for All is complete because there is a legislative capacity on that, which I understand because I have asked about it in the D&aacute;il.  However, there have been six years in between.  There are so many issues here that have never been dealt with.

An Bord Plean&aacute;la sent its inspector - no doubt an eminently qualified inspector - to adjudicate on that decision when that decision was appealed by the telecommunications company.  The inspector produced a detailed 34-page report upholding the decision of Monaghan County Council.

This provision would be as envisaged in the Aarhus Convention, that the court is used after the local authority and the other appeals' routes have been exhausted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05000","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":908,"content":"<p>On the amendment yesterday-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":909,"content":"<p>The piece about correcting-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Graham"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":910,"content":"<p>Would I be right in saying that it would allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to change its decision after it is challenged by a judicial review?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#U05300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":911,"content":"<p>Consideration is being given to further minor issues such as a typo or something that is inconsistent and that kind of issue, rather than a substantive change.

That is for 2021.<\/p> <p>  The second set is from the Mental Health Commission, again for 2021, and this received a qualified audit opinion.  The accounts, in my view, give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, and that is standard for many health bodies.  It is in the nature of a technical qualification there and it is only qualified in regard to that point.<\/p> <p>  There are nine sets of financial statements that come from the National Treasury Management Agency stable, if you like, and it has a very broad remit.<\/p><p>The first one is the accounts of the national debt of Ireland for 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.  The next one is the administration account for the National Treasury Management Agency.  These are the expenses of the organisation.  There is a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Next is the Post Office Savings Bank Fund for 2021.  It is a clear audit opinion.<\/p><p> The State Claims Agency received a clear audit opinion for 2021, but I do draw attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control that there were a number of erroneous payments made in 2021 to service providers due to the agency's manual payment processing.  The service providers returned the payment so there was no net loss, but still it was a control failing.<\/p><p> Next is the Dormant Accounts Fund for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) for 2021 received a clear audit opinion, but that is a nil account where there is no balance in the account at the moment.  No. 9 is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.  No. 10 is the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This is a fund that is now dissolved, and these are the final accounts for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The Ireland Apple Escrow Fund for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.<\/p><p> Moving on from the NTMA accounts, No. 12 is the Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla.  For 2021 it received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to the disclosures that are made in the accounts on material non-compliant procurement and the implications for Tusla of the cyberattack on the HSE's ICT system.  Tusla relies on support from the HSE for its ICT system.<\/p><p> The next one is the Cork Education and Training Board.  These are the financial statements for 2020.  It received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to disclosures about material non-compliant procurement, which occurs in other ETBs.  I also drew attention to significant delay and additional costs incurred by the board on a capital project for the building of an extension to one of its schools, due to the failure of the first appointed contractor in December 2017.  Last week, when the Department of Education was here, Deputy Murphy drew attention to that kind of situation.  There is another ETB coming forward where I draw attention to a similar problem.  Undoubtedly, there is or has been an issue there.<\/p><p> The final one for noting this week is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#CC00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":931,"content":"<p>This might be because I am a relatively new member, but I was just wondering when was the last time the Mental Health Commission was before the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#DD00200","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1657787400,"counter":932,"content":"<p>I do not remember it being here in ten years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#DD00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":933,"content":"<p>Could I make a request that, while I note it has a clear audit opinion, in terms of governance and good operations it would be very helpful to get the Mental Health Commission in for a review?

There is this moratorium where they have all started to be nice to each other to try to limit claims and, for that reason, they backed off putting in counterclaims.  There are other triggers.

I imagine it will probably compare fairly favourably with the pharmacy we have in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  This committee has a role to play and this follows on from Deputy Catherine Murphy's point.  We need to get clarification in the here and now, from both the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as to what measures and provisions they are putting in pre-contract and pre-tender to ensure we can say, in the same way almost anybody else in the world can, that when a contract is signed, this is how much the project will cost.  It does not need to be kept secret if it is defined in the contract, or if there are provisions that say it will potentially go to this cost if X, Y and Z happen or it could be less if A, B and C happen.  That is the way contracts are supposed to work when we are talking about construction.  We did not have that in respect of the national paediatric hospital.  That is why we are still figuring out three quarters of the way through building it how much it will actually cost.  It has not happened in far too many other areas so it must happen here.  If it does not, and we end up in a situation where the Committee of Public Accounts in ten or 15 years is having the same conversations about this hospital as we are about the national paediatric hospital, one will have to say it is time to bloody take down the whole system and start again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#GG01000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>To follow on from the previous Deputy, I think it will be hard for us to get to a number.  In light of the saga of the paediatric hospital, however, it is totally valid for us to ask what the clauses are in the tender, how that tender process is working and what we can do in that regard.  When it comes to the numbers that are being bandied around, and I put this to the Minister at the time at the Joint Committee on Health, the proposed building is 55,000 sq. m.  Health buildings at the moment cost approximately &euro;5,000 per sq. m.  Even with massive inflation, we are talking about a base cost of approximately &euro;275 million.  If we add in, let us say, one third for commissioning and one third for fees, we are still nowhere near &euro;800 million, which is what we were talking about at the time of the decision-making.  I do not know where we got to &euro;1 billion, but even &euro;800 million was a huge inflation.  I do not know how we got there.  When I put that to the Minister, I really got no answer to that.  It was said that is what had been reported in the media.  I would really like to understand this.<\/p> <p>  I know the decision has been made now.  I believe it has all been signed off from a project quality index point of view.  At the time of the decision, however, the business case had not been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It had been set out but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform refused it and sent it back.  I would love to understand and it would be really important for the Committee of Public Accounts to understand where the business case is right now.  Has it been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  What is that situation?<\/p> <p>  There is an issue around spending when there has been no agreement.  That is terrible in terms of public money and governance.  I do not think we should ever accept that.  To spend &euro;50 million or &euro;90 million - we are not even taking the number seriously now because it is all just a figure in taxpayers' money - when we do not have an agreement in place is atrocious.<\/p> <p>  Finally, if we are going back to the Department of Health to ask for information, particularly now that we are talking about Spanish hospitals and stuff, as I did at the time I would like to flag the fact that a scoping exercise for the maternity hospital was done on the Elm Park site in 2012.  There is a fully built hospital that has been empty for ten years sitting on the Elm Park site.  My understanding is that the scoping exercise found it was suitable for a maternity hospital.  The National Maternity Hospital did that scoping exercise and it found that it was suitable for a maternity hospital and for its needs.  I would love to see that report and for the Department of Health to release that report in order that we could see that scoping exercise.  My understanding is that the building is still empty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022071400002#GG01100","speaker":"1559"},{"type":"speech","time":1657787400,"counter":1008,"content":"<p>There are a number of parts here, the first of which being that we will note and publish the correspondence in front of us.

This is precisely the issue I was trying to draw attention to.  If we compare our approach in the Republic to that taken in Northern Ireland, it is possible to walk into the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, PRONI, which is in a lovely new building constructed in the Titanic Quarter, and to look at the Land Commission records there.  They are not digitised, but it is possible to go in and to look at them.<\/p> <p>  We have a 100-year rule on records but these documents seem to be an exception to this rule.  The Department has said that these are working records and fragile.  This is all the more reason, though, for why they would be digitised.  This is a useful item of correspondence but I still think we should respond in turn and ask why we do not have a similar approach to these records, in the context of the 100-year rule not applying, and why there is a different approach in Northern Ireland to making the Land Commission's records there available.  I ask this question because this information is a treasure trove.

In its correspondence, Benefacts set out 94 instances of data provision to public, private and non-profit bodies between 2016 and 2021.  Regarding its funding, the organisation has stated that it proposed that it be funded under the Teckal procurement exemption.  The committee has been provided with a copy of the advice regarding the feasibility of instituting these arrangements from the professional firm that prepared it.  Benefacts states that its board received no response to its proposal from the Department, nor was there any other opportunity to discuss alternative institutional, financial and governance arrangements.  It goes on to state that:<\/p> <blockquote> \tSenior officials in the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development advised Benefacts that they would not consider taking over responsibility for funding the company because they regarded Benefacts as a source of &ldquo;massive procurement risk&rdquo; [...] Notwithstanding this, the Department appears to have asked Pobal to explore the feasibility of providing a service that is on the face of it very similar to one of those already developed, tested and launched by Benefacts [...] even though of course Pobal is a provider to the State of what are by definition public goods under the Teckal exemption <\/blockquote> <p>It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to request the consent of Benefacts to also publish its correspondence.

Therefore, we should seek the response that Benefacts could not get from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the last paragraph of the correspondence in question, it relates to the same aspect of a market good.

I will begin by briefly outlining the economic and budgetary backdrop against which the budget is being prepared.<\/p><p>Budget 2023 is clearly coming at a challenging time for Ireland.  A little over two years ago, a pandemic without precedent upended our economy and society.  I know we all want to move on from the pandemic and to leave it in the rearview mirror, but we cannot forget the toll it has taken on lives, livelihoods and our national finances.  The Government responded, quickly and decisively, to protect households and businesses and to support our healthcare sector.  We employed the full range of the resources we had carefully built up to prevent a deep and disastrous recession.  This approach worked.  At an enormous cost, we protected our economy from long-term damage and set the stage for a robust and broad-based economic recovery, particularly with regard to employment, when the pandemic had been brought under control.  Today, there are more people at work in Ireland than ever before in our history.  In the depths of the pandemic, when unemployment was at record levels, few could have thought that possible.  It is a testament to the success of our budgetary policy that the link between employer and employee was maintained, and that people were able to return to work in such numbers as the recovery took hold.<\/p><p>However, as we are all well aware, the challenges did not end when the pandemic receded.  The invasion of Ukraine, and the necessary sanctions that have been imposed, have triggered a further global economic shock.  This is most evident in energy and commodity prices.  Along with lingering after-effects from the pandemic, headline inflation in Ireland, like most advanced economies, is now running at highs not seen in many decades.  In June, inflation rose to 9.6%, the highest level in nearly four decades.  People clearly feel the pain, with prices rising in the supermarket, at the petrol pump and elsewhere.  Once again, the Government has acted in response to an external economic shock.  While it is beyond the ability of any Government to fully offset the impact of inflation that is driven by global pressures, we have provided &euro;2.4 billion in direct relief to help ease the burden.  I note that measures have been particularly focused on assisting the most vulnerable.  Analysis of the distributional impact of these measures show that they are progressive, with the gains in disposable income most keenly felt by those in the lower income deciles.  For example, the Economic Insights - Spring 2022<i><\/i>document published by the Department of Finance in April 2022 shows that all households are expected to see increases in their weekly equivalised disposable income, with those in the lowest three income deciles gaining the most.  Coming on top of the response to Covid, the Government has made available more than &euro;50 billion in fiscal support over the past two and a half years.<\/p><p>This has taken a further toll on our public finances.  The strength of the economic recovery, supported by Government action, has enabled us to make significant progress in restoring our national finances to a healthier position than a year ago, but much remains to be done.  At over &euro;230 billion, our level of public debt on a <i>per capita<\/i>basis is among the highest in the developed world.  The economic context is now changing rapidly.  As a result of the jump in inflation, the extraordinary monetary support that has been made available over the last few years is now being withdrawn.  The cost of borrowing is now rising.  The era of low-cost borrowing is, clearly coming to an end.  There are now clear indications that momentum in the global economy is slowing and this is the case in Ireland too.  Furthermore, it is fair to say that the risks to the economy which we recognised in the stability programme update, have now begun to show signs of materialising.  A chief further risk is the potential for a withdrawal of natural gas supplies from Russia to mainland Europe.  While we do not, at present, view this as the most likely development, it clearly constitutes a very real risk nonetheless.  It would result in major economic disruption in export markets with severe second-round effects in Ireland. <br\/><br\/>In these highly uncertain times, with heightened vulnerabilities, managing the public finances in a careful and responsible way is a matter of urgency.  The committee will recall that the Government set out its medium-term budgetary strategy in last year's economic statement.  In brief, this strategy was aimed at putting our public finances on a sustainable trajectory by limiting core current expenditure growth to the trend growth of the economy.  This, of course, was framed in far more benign inflationary circumstances.In recognition of the changed circumstances, we have temporarily amended the expenditure rule for next year only.  To protect public services and incomes, core current expenditure will now increase by 6.5% in 2023.  For later years, the 5% rule will remain unchanged.  I would point out that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has endorsed this aggregate fiscal approach.  Accordingly therefore, the budget package for next year will be &euro;6.7 billion, comprised of &euro;5.65 billion in additional public expenditure and a tax package of &euro;1.05 billion.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, will provide the committee with more detail on the expenditure package shortly.  On the tax package, I note that this is now double the amount allowed for in the original budgetary strategy set out last year.  This is in recognition of the need to adjust the parameters for budget 2023 in view of the altered economic context.  A focus of the tax package in the budget will be to ensure workers do not move into higher tax bands purely due to inflation.  Inappropriately or poorly designed fiscal policy runs the risk of backfiring.  It can lead to an increase in inflationary pressures, with budgetary policy itself becoming part of the very problem that we are trying to address.  <br\/><br\/>This leads on to some concluding comments on corporate tax.  Taking into account the positive developments in tax revenue to date, an overall budget package of &euro;6.7 billion is consistent with a very modest budgetary surplus for next year.  There will of course be those who say we should spend this surplus.  What I find remarkable, is that those who call for higher spending, on housing for example, will at the same time object to those same homes being built.  <br\/><br\/>I want to stress that the headline taxation figures present an overly benign picture.  Much of the recovery in our public finances is due to the continuing surge in corporate tax receipts &ndash; up 53% in the year.  To be clear, we welcome these receipts.  They reflect well on Ireland as an attractive location for highly profitable multinational firms.  As I have warned many times however, these receipts are potentially extremely volatile and cannot be guaranteed at current levels into the future.  More than half of our corporate tax yield is now paid by ten large companies.  This means a very significant portion of our tax take is subject to the businesses decisions of a small number of taxpayers.  The buoyant corporate tax receipts we have experienced over the past several years could be transient, and they do not form a sound basis for building permanent commitments.  We cannot repeat other mistakes when temporary revenues were used to finance permanent spending because we know what happens when those revenues disappear.  I have therefore asked my officials to examine how much of the current corporation tax yield may be &quot;excess&quot;,  above what should be expected from the economic fundamentals, and this will be reported in advance of the budget.  Identifying this excess will enable us to avoid basing expenditure on unreliable revenues while ensuring Ireland remains a top-tier destination for foreign direct investment. <br\/><br\/>I will conclude on that point.  The Government has no money of its own.  It is public money that is hard-earned by the taxpayers of Ireland.  We have a duty to be responsible with that money, to make what at times can be difficult choices, to do what we can but to be honest with people that we cannot do everything.  The budgetary strategy set out in the summer economic statement meets these objectives.  It helps to strike the appropriate balance between supporting those who need help, such as individuals, families, farmers and business owners, while not adding to inflation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1084,"content":"<p>Good morning.  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to be here today alongside the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  The summer economic statement is a key milestone in our annual budgetary timetable.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s fiscal and expenditure strategy for the year ahead and provides an outline of the resources that will be available in the context of budget 2023.  The economy has emerged from the pandemic in a strong position.  The budgetary measures taken by the Government during the pandemic have made an enormous difference to the economy we see today.  Unemployment stands at 4.8% and over 2.5 million people are in employment, more than immediately prior to the pandemic.  Businesses too have displayed remarkable resilience as critical business supports such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, have been unwound.  As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe has highlighted however, the backdrop to next year&rsquo;s budget is an increasingly challenging one.  While the economic recovery from the pandemic has been rapid, as can be seen in the labour market, it has also led to a mismatch between demand and supply dynamics.  This is putting upward pressure on prices of goods and services.  Exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, increased consumer prices mean many households, particularly those on lower incomes, are experiencing difficulties with the rising cost of living.  The Government is acutely conscious of the burden this places on the Irish people. The challenging context has added further complexity to the formulation of our fiscal strategy for 2023.  In finalising the fiscal and budgetary parameters for the budget, we have sought to strike a balance between helping to mitigate cost-of-living pressures and ensuring sustainability of the public finances.  Overall policy must be responsive.  We are aiming to design a budgetary package to protect the most vulnerable in society and those on middle incomes while also ensuring measures do not add to pre-existing inflationary pressures.  In recognition of cost-of-living pressures, budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures to support citizens across a range of sectors.  Some headline measures included increases in weekly social protection payments as well as the fuel allowance and working family payment; health affordability measures; social and affordable housing funding; and enhanced student and childcare supports.  On the taxation side, which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has referred to, budget 2022 had a substantial almost &euro;600 million income tax package that increased the standard rate band and income tax credits.  In response to the evolving situation during the first half of this year, more than &euro;0.5 billion in additional expenditure measures have been introduced so far this year.  This included the &euro;200 electricity credit, further lump-sum fuel allowance payments and the back-to-school package announced just last week.  In addition, a number of exceptional taxation interventions were made.<\/p> <p>  While public expenditure responses cannot be deployed at the scale that would be needed to fully compensate for all cost increases, the Government has committed and will continue to provide significant resources to mitigate cost-of-living pressures by assisting those most impacted by energy price inflation and those most vulnerable to price increases.  This commitment has framed our preparations for the summer economic statement.  Last year, the medium-term expenditure strategy set out the dual objective of delivering sustainable expenditure over the medium-term through setting core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels and providing ongoing improvements in public services.  Our strategy must be responsive to the emerging economic landscape and take account of the exceptional and externally driven nature of the economic shocks we have endured.<\/p><p>It is clear that in order to protect the real value of public services, a short-term adjustment to the strategy is required.<\/p><p>\u00a0  In framing the summer economic statement, SES,  and budget 2023 parameters, we are seeking to balance the need to protect public services without feeding further inflationary pressures.  While Government cannot absorb the full impact of the current inflationary shock, we can and will take concrete action to support households, protect public services and invest in our critical public infrastructure. <\/p><p>As set out by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, this upward adjustment will result in an increased overall budgetary package of &euro;6.7 billion, of which almost &euro;5.7 billion will be in the form of additional expenditure and just over &euro;1 billion for taxation measures.  This package will see core spending increase by 6% this year and 6.5% next year.  It reflects the availability of an additional &euro;1.7 billion in resources compared with the level set out in the stability programme update last April.<\/p><p> In terms of expenditure, a total expenditure ceiling of &euro;90.3 billion will be set for next year to accommodate a range of different priorities, through core and non-core expenditure.  In 2023, &euro;85.8 billion of core expenditure will be available to provide for both ongoing costs of current service provision and additional public investment.  Approximately 3% of the core current expenditure base will be available to meet existing levels of service costs in 2023 compared with the current year.  This includes continued investment in the public sector workforce as the delivery mechanism for a wide range of critical services, as set out in Building Momentum; funding for demographic developments, including supporting a growing population and its changing profile; and the full year impact of measures from budget 2022, which are being implemented on a phased basis.<\/p><p> \u00a0There will be a &euro;0.8 billion increase in capital expenditure.  Overall core capital investment will reach some &euro;11.7 billion in 2023, with an additional &euro;0.2 billion as part of the national recovery and resilience plan.  This represents an increase of 7%, which is in line with the National Development Plan 2021-2030.  This funding will provide for key investment across sectors, including housing, healthcare, education and transport while investing in our climate goals.  There is also likely to be a carryover from any unspent element of the capital budget this year.<\/p><p> A sum of &euro;2.7 billion will be available for new expenditure measures of which approximately &euro;400 million will take effect in the current year.  This overall envelope of funding must accommodate priorities across a wide range of policy areas including: the public service pay bill, which is a significant driver of current expenditure and amounts to close to a third of core current spending each year; spending on social protection, which accounts for around another third of core current spending; and Government commitments regarding housing, climate action and healthcare.  I would also note that separately a number of one-off measures for implementation in 2022 are being developed by my Department in partnership with colleagues across Government.  An announcement on this will be made on budget day.<\/p><p> While the resources that are being made available are significant and will have a considerable impact, prioritisation will be required given the significant level of competing demands on public expenditure.  As is always the case, resources are limited and we must prioritise.<\/p><p> In 2023, Government will provide &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure for temporary measures.  This follows on from the &euro;7.5 billion in non-core expenditure provided for in the current year.  This approach to expenditure management has proved critical in recent years to helping Government respond to the numerous external shocks.  The 2023 funding will provide for the continuation of key Covid supports in certain sectors, the provision of supports to help counter the negative impacts of Brexit through the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, and key humanitarian supports for refugees arriving from Ukraine.<\/p><p> As I noted earlier, the 6.5% increase in core expenditure for next years must accommodate a range of priorities . It also means ensuring that spending delivers sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  This will require decisions to be made across Government and prioritisation of demands.  A range of expenditure reforms have a role to play in supporting this process and ensure spending delivers efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.  These reforms include the spending review process; performance budgeting; and the use of Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, resources across the system to provide important information and critical insights to inform decisions.  In that context, my Department will publish the mid-year expenditure report later this month.  This is an important document that sets out a clear and detailed view of the baseline expenditure position in advance of the upcoming Estimates process.  I hope that it will be of benefit to the committee as well as part of its whole-of-year engagement on budgetary issues.<\/p><p> To conclude, while we are undoubtedly in a very challenging situation we have seen considerable improvements in the State's overall fiscal position.  This allowed us and will continue to allow us to respond to these challenges in a fiscally sustainable manner thus protecting public services, improving outcomes and investing in our future.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to address the committee and I look forward to answering questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#B00200","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Aire.

It is the case that whatever is agreed, and I hope an agreement can be reached, will come out of the overall envelope of approximately &euro;2.7 billion.  As I have said in recent weeks, we have identified approximately &euro;400 million for early implementation measures in the current year.  This could be a combination of changes in public service pay in the current year and any decision the Government might make to implement immediately changes on the core permanent side of expenditure, such as happened with the fuel allowance last year.

One of the issues that I am particularly exercised about is eligibility for social housing and social housing support.  We have been repeatedly given commitments on publishing the outcome of a review that has been running for at least five years, which it was reported was concluded in December 2021.  It still has not been published or announced despite repeated promises that it would be before the summer recess.  There is absolutely no justification for the fact that the review has gone on for that long.<\/p><p>There is certainly no justification for the fact that the Minister has sat on it from December.  The ESRI quantified the number of people in need of housing support who were cut off their entitlement to social housing or social housing support in the form of HAP, RAS or whatever.  That was pretty stark.  We knew it anecdotally from the people coming in week after week saying they were on the housing list for ten years, that they cannot afford market rent and now they are off the list.  The ESRI said in its recent report that the number of people eligible for social housing support has dropped from 46% about a decade ago to 33%.  This is a massive stealth cut in housing support, affecting tens of thousands of working people who previously would have received some support to deal with extortionate rents or who might have gotten a social house at some point, who now do not get it and go over a cliff once their income goes over &euro;35,000 net or perhaps a bit more depending on the family size.  They are now left completely in the wilderness and have to pay rents that are completely unaffordable.<\/p><p> My question for the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is whether he has discussed this with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, because I suspect that the reason this review has not been published is that the Government is terrified of the costs that could ensue if the income eligibility threshold is increased by whatever amount.  If it was restored in real terms to the level it was at ten years ago, which to my mind is the absolute minimum that should be done, given that the number of people in need of the support has grown exponentially with high rents, I imagine the bill for that would be pretty high.  I cannot conceive of the idea that the Minister has not discussed this and that it is not at the back of the delay in publishing the outcome of the review.  Has the Minister discussed it?  Is he aware of the cost?  Is that the reason we have not seen the outcome of the review?  What is going to happen to it?  If that is not the case, when will we hear about what is going to happen with the income threshold, which is a very pressing matter now for huge numbers of people?

We are awaiting the outcome of that review and it is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to bring that forward.

That group of people whose income is in excess of &euro;35,000 or perhaps up to &euro;40,000 is still eligible depending on family size, but they are pushed over a cliff.  Some of those people are in homeless accommodation as we speak and are now not even entitled to that.  They are being threatened with eviction from homeless accommodation because they have gone over a threshold, having been on a housing list for ten years.  To be honest, you could not make this stuff up in terms of what is going on.  This is life and death stuff for some of them due to the situation they are in.  On that level of income, they have no chance of paying the rents in Dublin and they have no chance of purchasing.  The Government says the affordable housing schemes are coming and all the rest of it, but we are quite a few years away from them having any impact - even if they work - and there are question marks in that regard for that cohort.

If we push it up to &euro;50,000, it will cost this much.  If the Minister has not quantified it - I take his word that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not blocking this - and if that is what he tells me, I believe it, but is it even part of the Minister's budgetary considerations?  If it is not, that tells me we are not going to have the thresholds moved before the budget, which is a very serious breach of promise, because we were told by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage - and I have been told by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions - that the outcome of that review was going to be made public before the summer recess.

I am not just referring to the fact that there are refugees coming into the country.  According to every sort of measure, the situation has got worse.  House prices have reached astronomical proportions.  At the epicentre of the housing crisis, the rent situation is going from bad to worse on a weekly basis.  On top of that, there is inflation, which is in effect an income cut for the very same people who have to pay those rents or consider taking out a mortgage with less income for higher cost accommodation.  Is any consideration being given to the idea that that envelope of spending and investment in the area of housing is just going to have to increase?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#G00300","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1176,"content":"<p>To be honest, I think the priority is delivery.  In the past two years, the construction industry was shut down for several months each year because of Covid.  That had an impact on delivery.  We ended up delivering about 20,000 units each year in 2020 and 2021.  We know that we need far more than that.  It is estimated that we need to deliver at least 33,000 units each year.  I think the forecast for this year is around 24,600 units.  Hopefully, that will be achieved and even exceeded.  The funding is in place.  It is really about delivery.  Looking at Housing for All and the targets it sets across cost rental, local authority affordable housing, the First Home affordable purchase and shared equity scheme and the work that the Land Development Agency, LDA, is doing in Project Tosaigh, if we can achieve those targets, we will make a real difference.  The funding is there to back that up.  From where I am sitting, I do not currently see funding as the constraint.  There were underspends in each of the past two years.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has underspent so far this year on capital.  It remains to be seen how the second half of the year pans out.  The funding is certainly there to deliver the units.  That is the priority.  We are seeing progress, as the Deputy well knows, in terms of commencements and new planning permissions being granted.  The pipeline appears to be strong.  However, I acknowledge that there are headwinds in the sector too.  Construction inflation is running at a very high rate.  The cost of certain materials went up by 40% and 60% in the last year, which is having a direct impact on delivery. There are also labour shortages in the sector.  There are headwinds and challenges in delivering the targets.  However, on the social housing side, the direct build forecast for the current year is over 8,000, as against a target of 9,000 direct build units.  Despite the challenges, a lot of progress has been made in delivering social housing.  We are seeing that all over the country.  The performance does vary from local authority to local authority.  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are playing an increasingly important role, but the funding is there.

Currently, there is a 20-year waiting list.  If that is as far we are going to go, we will still be in trouble on this issue in five years' time.

As he is aware, in People Before Profit we are very prudential in our budgeting so that when we argue for substantially increasing expenditure beyond what the Minister is proposing, as we do, we always propose revenue-raising measures such as wealth taxes, increases in employer PRSI rates and increases in corporate tax and financial transaction taxes.  The Government always pooh-poohs our figures as to what we could raise through the introduction of such measures.  Recently, Oxfam estimated that a 2% wealth tax on those with over &euro;4 million in assets would raise &euro;4 billion.  I am sure the Minister will say that is just not true.  I personally think it is.  Even if a quarter of that estimated amount could be raised by a wealth tax on the wealthiest people in this country, it would be a lot of money.  Given the huge challenges and demands we face, is any consideration being given to the introduction of some additional revenue-raising measures in the form of taxes on those who have not done too badly or have done very well over the last period, including the very wealthy and some areas of big business?  For example, we could introduce a windfall tax on the energy companies or the big investment funds in housing and property that have done very well over the last period.  Is any consideration being given to the idea that such companies and funds should be asked to cough up a bit of extra tax from the gains that they have made while other people have been suffering, to help fund the big challenges we have and to shield others who are being hammered by the cost-of-living crisis?<\/p> <p>  I am out of time, so I will throw in one last question.  On the issue of public sector pay, our view is that pay, pensions and income should at least keep pace with inflation.  Otherwise, we are reducing the spending power of people, which means human suffering for them, and it also potentially has a negative knock-on effect for the rest of the economy.  People have less purchasing power, which then hits the economy.  We think it is an economic, social and moral imperative to ensure that public sector pay, pensions and income at least keep pace with the rate of inflation so that people are not losing real income or purchasing power.  What does the Minister say to that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#G01500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1186,"content":"<p>I will deal with the question on revenue-raising measures first.

There are always measures that allow the Government to raise additional revenue to fund changes in expenditure or taxation elsewhere.  <\/p><p> We have to get the balance right.  I have always recognised that the Deputy's figures have a coherence to them.  He came out and said how much more he wants to spend and put in place measures that, in an abstract way, would allow him to fund that additional expenditure.  Where he and I have differed for many years is that he sees the world as being static and assumes that if we increase taxes on workers and companies investing in our country that there will be no consequence.  I strongly believe there will be a consequence.  Putting in place measures that increase the level of taxation that large employers pay would, over time, lead to those large employers employing fewer people in Ireland.<\/p><p> I refer to windfall charges and taxes.  We should bear in mind that some of the companies involved are owned by the State.  Any change in how much money we want to recoup from those companies at a point in the future can be achieved by revision and dividend policy.  I guarantee the Deputy that even if the State makes such a change, that will have an impact.  It will, for example, impact on the investment plans that we need many semi-State companies to deliver in order for Ireland to have a higher share of energy through the renewable sources that we have the ability to generate in our jurisdiction.  <\/p><p> We only have to consider the reaction in the UK to its proposal to bring forward a large windfall tax, even with investment reduction.  Many larger companies are now saying that could affect their investment plans.  We need to bear in mind that we have seven auctions for our offshore wind energy.  Does the Deputy think those auctions will be unaffected if, while they are under way, we decided we would arbitrarily increase the taxes companies would pay for supplying our country with energy?  That is the difference.<\/p><p> As always, we will consider other measures to determine whether they will raise revenue.

All of the advice we have received from reputable bodies, domestically and internationally, has been not to chase inflation.  Pay alone should not chase inflation.  If we did that, we would drive it higher and it would become more embedded with second and third round effects.

In the measures we have introduced in recent months, we have tried to strike a balance between ensuring that most of the measures are targeted and generally involve using the social welfare system, such as the fuel allowance scheme, back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and so on.  We have also had measures with a broader application that benefit people who are above the social welfare qualifying threshold.  The electricity credit is an obvious example, as well as the abolition last week of school transport fees, a reduction in public transport fares for younger people and the population generally and changes to the drug payment threshold scheme.<\/p> <p>  In framing a set of one-off measures, we will have to strike a balance.  Our principle is that many of the measures will need to be targeted because this is, in the main, but not exclusively, an energy price crisis.  We are seeing broader inflation in food and across a range of other materials and goods that people purchase.  We recognise that people who are earning above the upper limits are also struggling and feeling the pressure.  There will need to be measures that go beyond the eligibility cohort, as defined by the social protection code.<\/p> <p>  The other issue raised by the Deputy comes down to the interaction between the social welfare system and work.  We often hear examples of people who can only take on so many hours because they will lose certain benefits or feel it is not worth their while to work.  The principle that we as a Government subscribe to is that it should always pay to work.  If people have the opportunity to take on more hours, that should also pay.  We are examining the interaction between the welfare system and work, in particular, to determine whether there are any issues we can address which would allow people to participate to a greater extent in the labour market, be that taking up employment or doing more work if they are currently in employment.

The Government will have to identify core priorities and we know what they are in the context of this budget.  It is about the cost of living.  It is about helping people manage through this difficult and challenging inflationary spiral.  We have acknowledged that it is not just impacting on people on social welfare, though it is most acutely impacting them because they have fixed incomes and, by definition, are on quite low levels of income.

We all got a renewed sense of appreciation for the environment, local amenities, walkways, greenways, biodiversity and all the issues the Deputy touched on.  The adoption of the well-being framework now is particularly timely.  It includes 11 overall dimensions from which the well-being dashboard of 35 indicators flows.  Those are wide-ranging, as the Deputy has acknowledged.  We have examined the experience of other countries, including New Zealand, which is seen as a world leader in this regard.  We have also looked at the work of the OECD and my Department has established a well-being public policy unit.  It is a work in progress and we are going to continue to develop it.  There are future phases for the development of the well-being framework.  Well-being issues very often come down to the fundamental things people need in their lives, which is a roof over their head, accommodation, access to healthcare when they need it and a basic level of income to give them a decent quality of life.  Particularly at a time of high inflation, that is where our focus lies.<\/p> <p>  While we have a well-being framework, it is not something we look at as separate to the budget.  We do not consider all the other issues and then look at the well-being framework and see how that influences us.

We have to think about what things contribute to well-being that really matter to people in their day-to-day lives.  In the Deputy's question and in our responses we have acknowledged what we believe those things are, namely, the basic supports and services people rely on.  It is a very welcome departure in Irish politics and in our budgetary process to include well-being and equality budgeting.  In recent years, we have increasingly published more and more material on equality budgeting and we will continue with that in the context of the budget, as well as later in the year as part of the Revised Estimates when more and more Departments and budget-holders will bring forward metrics and evidence on how they are accounting for equality budgeting.

There are a few items I wanted to get their thoughts on.  I listened to their earlier contributions.  Are there any circumstances where they would be required to change the parameters before the budget because of what might happen with external factors or other factors?  They have said there will be no changes.  I refer to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Many of the factors impacting us are external, such as the impact of Ukraine on oil prices and so forth.  Are there any further supports coming from Europe?  Is this something being looked at at a European level?  I ask the Ministers to comment on our level of national debt.  We are now into a period where the ECB's involvement in the bond market is dissipating.  What impact is that having for us in terms of interest rates, our national debt and refinancing the national debt?  Where do we stand on that?<\/p> <p>  I have two further questions specifically for the Minister for Finance.  I note he is doing a review of corporation tax.  When does he expect that to be ready?  It is a feature that comes up a lot in the media.<\/p><p>Our corporation tax revenues are buoyant but in many cases they are coming from a small group of companies giving an exponentially high level of corporation tax.  That is to be welcomed, but how will that frame the policy on taxes and spending?<\/p><p> I have a specific question on the Living City initiative which I will hold to the end because it is a stand-alone question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#J00700","speaker":"1593","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I will kick off because the Deputy opened with questions that are relevant to me.<\/p> <p>  I do not foresee any changes in our budget day parameters between now and budget 2023 being announced.  At &euro;6.7 billion, it will be the largest budget in core spending that any Government has introduced in Ireland for quite some time.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has said on a number of occasions, it will be accompanied by once-off measures within 2022.  That means the overall budget day package will have additional measures for 2022 on top of a very significant increase in our budget day package for 2023.<\/p> <p>  I have already acknowledged the growth in our national debt.  Deputy O'Donnell is well aware of it so I will not repeat what I have said on that.  If I look at the measure that matters very much to us, which is what that stock of debt looks like as a share of the value in income of the goods and services in our country, an important picture is developing.  First, when and if the Government holds inside the budget day parameters that we have indicated for this year and the years to come, it means our stock of public debt will begin to fall after the very sudden increase during the era of Covid-19.  According to the summer economic statement, we currently stand at a stock of debt for 2022 of &euro;233.8 billion.  As we stay inside our budget day parameters it will begin to fall as an amount of debt, which is a significant change from where we have been over the last two years, moving by 2025 to &euro;227 billion.  While that fall in the quantity of debt in itself is helpful but in real terms is not huge, it means, importantly, that our debt as a share of national income when measured as GNI begins to fall.  That is the key thing for us given how high our debt is in the first place.  Notably, it means that our share of debt falls from 96.5% at present to below 90% next year and to below 80% by 2025.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#K00200","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1202,"content":"<p>There will be a reduction in the actual amount of national debt coupled with a reduction in the percentage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#K00300","speaker":"1593"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>The percentage reduction is faster.  All other things being equal, on our current forecasts we are still expecting our national income to grow.  That is particularly important.  At the start of the year the interest we were paying on our national debt for new borrowing was approximately zero and today it is 1.7%.  I will note, before others make the point to me, that the 1.7% is a reduction on where we have been in the last few weeks, when it was well above 2%, but there is a hell of a difference between zero and 1.7%.  Our expectation is that we will continue to see change in the sovereign bond markets as the ECB changes monetary policy in response to what is happening to inflation.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Deputy asked a specific question about corporation tax.  We will have that work complete before the budget.  There are many different forecasts regarding how much our national debt and how much our corporate tax receipts could be affected by changes in the business cycle or OECD corporate tax reform.  It is not always helpful for me to base our preparation on what could be the biggest figure.  What we have to do is try to have a figure that we believe is a reasonable assessment regarding what the vulnerability could be, as opposed to the largest figure out there.  That is work I asked the Department to do and we will have that work done by the budget because, in turn, it could influence other choices we make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#K00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>With regard to EU funding, we are working on the basis of commitments that have been made already in different funding streams.

We are making provision, as can be seen in the summer economic statement, for a further &euro;200 million of that to be spent across next year.<\/p> <p>  Under the Brexit adjustment reserve we will receive a total of &euro;1.165 billion in current prices.  We have already received the first tranche of that.  It has to be spent by the end of next year.  The reference period goes back to the beginning of 2020 so eligible spending must occur between 2020 and 2023, inclusive.  We have made certain allocations so far to a number of Departments.  We have given approval to a range of schemes in agriculture and fisheries brought forward by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  We have a major infrastructure project at Rosslare Europort that is currently under procurement and there are a number of other proposals from Departments that are currently being considered.<\/p> <p>  This funding comes in the form of pre-financing.  We submit the formal claim in 2024, after the reference period, but we get the money upfront.  Clearly, we have to ensure that it is spent in a way that fully conforms with EU spending rules and there is a strict requirement that it must be linked to the adverse effects of Brexit.  Ensuring that the spend is eligible is a critical test and it is one on which we must be sure.  It is not as simple as coming up with new spending ideas or things it would be nice to do.  The link with the adverse effects of Brexit has to be explicit, clear and demonstrable, but we are making good progress on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#K00500","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1205,"content":"<p>I have a small addendum to that.

I thank the Minister.<\/p> <p>  My next question is for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  I refer back to the end of last year.  The Living City initiative is available in Limerick city, which is a Georgian city.  Unlike probably any other city in Ireland, the footprint in the city is primarily Georgian.  The Living City initiative was introduced a number of years ago.  There has been some success, but not what one would expect.<\/p><p>In terms of the latest figures from the Department, about 37 properties have availed of the scheme.  I asked last year for a review of the scheme and the Minister kindly took it on board.  I understand that the Tax Strategy Group is looking at it and will bring forward a report to the Minister.  Really bringing the city up - and the city is doing very well with great employment and a lot of positivity - is very difficult when it comes to the footprint of the city, which is Georgian.  I ask that when the Minister comes to his budget deliberations, he would consider the review and look at certain areas such as owner-occupier residential properties, particularly around making the initiative consistent with the other schemes for commercial property and landlords in terms of the period for which they can claim and being able to carry forward the relief.  It is scheduled to conclude at the end of this year.  If the Minister is looking at it, I ask that we would get some bit of headwind that the Minister might extend it for a number of years rather than just one year.  I wanted to raise the matter with the Minister in advance of his budget deliberations.  It is something in which I am particularly interested.  Could the Minister give me his thoughts on the initiative?  For those of us in Limerick city, it could be a phenomenal catalyst if it is looked at and amended and if we can encourage more people to participate in it.  I want to see families coming to live in the city and people being able to move to the city.  The city is very vibrant but the cost of doing up Georgian buildings is far more expensive that the cost of doing up a standard house.

I make the point that just last week an additional &euro;67 million was announced which included the extension of hot meals to children attending DEIS schools.  This was a really important initiative that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, brought forward.  This also included the abolition of school transport fares and the improvement in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  We recognise there are extra costs at this time of year and we took the view that because this is when these costs are being incurred, we would have to address these outside of the normal budgetary calendar.  Those moves have been broadly welcomed.<\/p> <p>  On transport fares, we should not understate the importance of the 50% reduction on fares for young people and the 20% reduction across the population generally on public transport services.  The continuation of that or any further measures and all of those issues have to be considered as part of the Estimates process.  There will be a lot of different priorities competing for resources and we will have to work our way through that as best we can.  <\/p> <p>  Progress is being made on the payment of the pandemic recognition payment.  We would all have liked it to have happened more quickly.  For those who are directly employed by the HSE, I think the vast majority have now received the payment.  For those who are not directly employed such as staff in hospices, private nursing homes and members of the Defence Forces, there is further work to be done.  The Department of Health is working its way through that currently.  <\/p> <p> Regarding waiting lists, we have an initiative to the value of approximately &euro;250 million because waiting lists have grown unfortunately.  The pandemic had a real impact.  It is a Government priority now to address that.  People are waiting too long and we are going to do all we can to make a lot of progress in that area.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#M00700","speaker":"1459"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1236,"content":"<p>A Theachta Lahart, as per the speaking rota, the final speakers get five minutes.

I will time myself.  I appreciate the Ministers' willingness always to come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The Ministers have mentioned the significant measures the Government has taken to address the cost of living and that there will be more.  One that stands out to me and that I have highlighted is the medical expenses threshold measure which has been cut in the space of 18 months.  As the Minsters know, the threshold was &euro;124 before people could get free medication on a monthly basis and this is now down to &euro;80.  That is a saving of close to &euro;500 a year.  It is quite significant then.  I refer to some of the other measures as well not least the back-to-school allowance which is a very proactive response.<\/p> <p>  I want to take into account everything that has been said about the pressures that people are under.  I went to buy a pair of shoes recently in Rathfarnham Shopping Centre.  I got good value you will all be pleased to know.  However, the staff there said that all the talk of the challenges facing the country is having a negative impact on people's willingness to spend.  People have become quite anxious about it.  There is the message of the fact of full employment and the fact that two weeks ago 200,000 people left this country to take holidays - a very positive sign of an economy doing well.  It is an economy that clearly has its challenges and we need people to keep spending money to bring more taxes in and to be able to make the significant impacts we have been making on the cost of living for people.  I put the question to both Ministers.  Is the fact that very little is being made of the really positive things happening in the economy and that so much negative talk is going on creating an environment where people are anxious to spend, something they are conscious of?   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#M00900","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>The Minister, Deputy McGrath and I are constantly at pains to acknowledge the challenges and difficulties many are facing at the moment but in the same breath to make the point regarding the things that are still going well in our economy.  We both made reference in our opening statements to where we are with income, with employment and to the growth that has taken place in our economy and the very positive change that has happened since the pandemic has lessened.  We are aware of the need for that balance because it is important the people of our country are reminded that despite the new challenges we are facing so soon after we have dealt with the cost of a pandemic, we have an economy that has a very high level of employment, is still growing in a very robust way, and has public finances that have recovered.  That should give us confidence in our ability to manage the challenges that lie ahead.  Deputy McGrath and I have said again and again that we cannot meet every need placed upon us in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere but we are both confident we can do enough to help and that we will continue to do that.  As one final concluding comment on that,  Deputy Ryan made the point earlier regarding what is happening with public transport in Spain and what is happening in Poland with VAT.  If we go down the path of picking the single biggest measure each country has done and say in the round that Ireland has to match them all, that is the path to the creation of new risks and problems for ourselves.  We have to compare what we are doing in the round, to what other countries are doing in the round.  There are plenty of economies that have not cut excise, or VAT, or that have not done the one-off payments that Minister McGrath has brought forward.  What Ireland has done in terms of scale and targeted and broad measures, compares well to what many other countries in Europe have done and we should continue to look at it in the round when comparing overall what we are doing versus elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#M01000","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1239,"content":"<p>I will add a quick word to that and I thank Deputy Lahart for coming in.<\/p><p>It is inevitable in many respects that the challenges and the negatives tend to get a lot of traction, whether it is Covid, Brexit or the terrible war in Ukraine and the inflationary spiral that is causing.  However, there are many positives.  Ireland is an outlier in European terms in so many respects on the positive side.  There is the level of growth we continue to enjoy, the job creation, the dramatic improvement in the public finances and the continuing strong investment pipeline announcements by both FDI clients and Enterprise Ireland clients, which are really strong and positive.  We must strike a balance between acknowledging the headwinds - and there is a great degree of uncertainty at the moment about the international economy in particular - but also recognising sentiment is important and the Deputy is spot on there.  It is a key driver of economic performance because while there are undoubtedly many people struggling at the moment there are many others who have resources and we want them to make decisions to invest, spend and play an active part in our economy.  Our giving a fair presentation of all the issues, including the challenges and also the positives and strengths, can play an important point in giving that sense of confidence, because we are confident.  It is not false hope.  It is important to give people hope based on realism about the outlook for the Irish economy.  We will get through this period and Ireland will continue to be a strong performer.  It is just important we make the right decisions to help us on that journey.  I thank the Deputy for making the point as it is a really important one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#M01100","speaker":"1459","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1241,"content":"<p>I thank the Ministers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2022071400002#N00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1657753200,"counter":1242,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and the Ministers.
