Today and tonight, people need to stay safe.  No one should take chances or risks.  It is important that we pay tribute to our front-line workers.  After 18 months of heroism, they now find themselves in the eye of the storm, again risking their own safety to keep us safe and the show on the road.  We thank them.<\/p>  <p>  Our children are not in school today because of this exceptional storm.  We are now in winter and our children and teaching staff have been freezing in classrooms wearing hats and scarves during the school day, with windows wide open in an attempt to keep them safe.  We are nearly two years into this pandemic, but the Government has still not delivered a plan for proper ventilation in our schools.  It has been clear for some time that high-efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters have an important role to play in ensuring schools have clean air.  They remove contaminants and viruses from the air and help reduce airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation.  The WHO, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the Government's own expert group on ventilation have emphasised the value of HEPA filters in keeping schools safe.  Instead of listening to this expert advice and installing HEPA filters in schools, the Government's approach is, as the Taoiseach put it at his press conference on Friday, to open the windows and so on.<\/p>  <p>  Parents and school staff must have been shaking their heads in disbelief.  This refusal to act on filtration in schools reminds us of the Government's reticence to accept the advice on mask wearing at the start of the pandemic and its failure to incorporate antigen tests until the eleventh hour in the fight against Covid.  We again see no sense of urgency, no forward planning and no common sense from the Government on the issue of ventilation in schools.<\/p>  <p>  It has been known for some time that Covid is an airborne virus and we knew that schools would be a greater challenge in the face of a more transmissible variant.  The rates of infection among school-aged children have shot up in recent months.  The writing is on the wall and the Government has had ample time and every opportunity to get things right, yet it has wasted these opportunities.<\/p> <p>In December last year, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire called on the Minister for Education to ensure that schools were provided with devices over the Christmas break to make sure children returned to safely ventilated classrooms last January.  He was ignored.  Indeed, it took nine months for the Government to act on CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors.  These monitors are badly needed but they do not clean the air.  They have to be backed up with a filtration system.  We do not have another nine months to wait for the Government to get HEPA devices into classrooms.<br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\"> T&aacute; s&eacute; thar am anois chun a bheith d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoi aer&aacute;il cheart sna scoileanna agus ag coinne&aacute;il p&aacute;ist&iacute; agus baill fhoirne s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte.

Our emergency services, ESB staff, council employees and community workers are all doing so at considerable personal risk and I pay tribute to the National Emergency Co-ordination Centre for the preparatory work it has been engaged in for well over the past week, planning and preparing for what is a very challenging, difficult and varied storm.  To the members of that team, we owe an awful lot indeed.<\/p>  <p>  On the situation pertaining to Covid, putting aside all the noise and the attempts to undermine or attack the Government, which is a legitimate position from the Opposition if it wants to pursue that road, the most important collective message we as a House can give to people today is to take their booster vaccine when they are offered it.  Vaccination, more than anything else, is protecting people against severe illness, hospitalisation and admission to ICUs.  The booster vaccination jabs have been shown to produce very strong antibody responses and are likely to provide protection against severe disease, hospitalisation and death from most variants, including Delta and Omicron.<\/p>  <p>  The reason I am saying this is that in the week commencing 22 November, 208,000 appointments were offered, of which about 80,000 turned up.  Last week, of 180,000 appointments, 93,000 turned up.  The same urgency does not seem to be there in respect of availing of the option to take the booster as was there when we were offered the first and second doses.  In the over-75 group, where people have been taking up the offer of a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine in high numbers, we are seeing a significant reduction in the incidence of the disease, so it does work.  The booster vaccines will have a really significant impact on Delta.  I cannot stress that enough.  It is the one message I want to get across today, above and beyond everything else to do with Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  On ventilation and our schools, the Minister for Education has at all times adhered to expert advice in respect of ventilation.  While it may at times be tempting to lampoon the idea of fresh air, the number one item on that expert advice is that, where possible, fresh air is the most effective form of ventilation.  Of course, that has limitations in the context of cold and inclement weather.  The Minister for Education has provided substantial resources to schools and will continue to do so.  Schools will be in a position, if they wish and if it is suitable, to buy HEPA filters for classrooms, but I point out the advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, SAGE, the expert body in the UK, on HEPA filters.<\/p> <p>It is saying there is a need for better data on real-world application to support these technologies.  It may be a viable solution in spaces where it is difficult to provide good ventilation.  SAGE is saying that a lot of the application of filters will depend on the configuration of rooms and certain situations.<\/p> <p> The point I would make is this.  I have noticed throughout the course of the pandemic that, every now and again, someone comes up with the magic solution.  Invariably, there is no one magic silver bullet to deal with Covid.  It is a combination of efforts and, right now, it seems to me, from looking at the data, that the most effective thing we can do out there is to encourage people to take their booster vaccine when it is offered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700004#B00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638886200,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Of course, there is no single silver bullet, more is the pity, and there is no single answer, including vaccination, although I am never one to lampoon either fresh air or the need for vaccination and for boosters, which is absolutely imperative.  However, I asked the Taoiseach a different question.  I asked him about ventilation and air quality in our classrooms.  Between removing contact tracing from schools, a very sluggish response to teaching supply and mixed and confused messaging on children wearing masks in schools, the Government's record in dealing with staff and children in the classroom is not good.  To say to staff and children that the answer is to shiver in classrooms is not acceptable.  These HEPA filters are one item, an important item, in the toolbox that we have to keep people safe.<\/p><p>I have asked the Taoiseach a very straightforward question.  I have quoted the expert advice.  The World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and, indeed, the expert group that his own Government appointed recognise that these filters are an important intervention.  Instead of taking a <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach with schools, I want the Taoiseach to commit that the Government will ensure that these filters are rolled out.  Use the Christmas break, use the opportunity of the kids being on holidays, to install these ventilators and to ensure that we have clean air and that we do not have frozen children and staff members, as one action, but an important action, in an array of things we will have to do to keep our children safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700005#C00200","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1638886200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Deputy heard my initial reply but the funding will be made available if schools wish to purchase HEPA filters in given situations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700005#C00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638886200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Is that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700005#C00400","speaker":"1466"},{"type":"speech","time":1638886200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I know the Deputy accused us of mixed messaging and so forth.

I do not want to use the phrase &ldquo;gag&rdquo; but that seems to be what it is.  Now, all communication has to go through the Government Information Service, GIS.  If that is the way the Taoiseach wants to do things, that is fine, but he is responsible for that because it reports to him and GIS is in his Department.  Why is this change happening now as regards the process by which NPHET communicates with the public?  The Taoiseach is responsible for it, but why now?  Is it because of what happened last Thursday in regard to information coming out from a NPHET meeting before the Government made the decision?  If it is, just say so.<\/p>  <p>  I have a concern.  The Government makes decisions and has to make the ultimate communications, but there are times when we have to hear directly from public health experts in regard to specifics.  We have a storm going on outside.  With all due respect to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I would rather hear from Evelyn Cusack and Met &Eacute;ireann as regards the direction of that storm than from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage because there is a very specific need.  I say that in jest but we are also in the middle of a pandemic.<\/p> <p>There are specific needs as regards information that has to be communicated.  Going through GIS in order to have to make media appearances is worrying from a transparency point of view.<\/p> <p> The Taoiseach needs to clear this up because, from my perspective and from that of the Labour Party, the main confusion over the past week has not been from NPHET but from the Government.  When it came to antigen testing, the Government indicated there were going to be subsidies but then all of a sudden the Minister announced on television that there would not be.  A missive was sent out at 6.15 p.m. on Tuesday last regarding masks being mandatory.  There was a U-turn on Monday because I challenged the Government in the D&aacute;il on the legality of this for principals.  In some cases, principals were unwilling to do it.  That changed as a result.  There were changes in respect of those arriving into the country.  Aer Lingus informed the country that a change had taken place between Friday and Sunday as regards the requirement for PCR and antigen tests on arrival.  We see a pattern here.<\/p> <p> I also raised the issue of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and Ministers were touting different schemes until yesterday when the Minister for Social Protection gave us some, but not all, the information.  We now know that information will not be fully out there until Thursday or Friday.  We have the issues of HEPA filters, and I agree with the previous speaker that this has been going on forever.  I have no understanding whatsoever as to why this has not been put forward and dealt with.<\/p> <p> I want to ask the Taoiseach the following questions.  Who is responsible for the change in policy of how NPHET is to communicate with the public on specific public health issues?  Why was that decided?  Does the Taoiseach accept that it is Ministers and their failures as regards communication that have created the omnishambles over the five issues I have pointed out in the past week alone?  For those workers who are so impacted by the restrictions that have been brought about, including those who are servicing the hospitality industry - taxi drivers and others - what bespoke measures will be put in place in order to support them during this difficult time?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700005#C01300","speaker":"1610","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638886800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s comments on the centrality and importance of the public health advice during the global pandemic.  From the outset of this pandemic, when I was on the Opposition benches in the immediate aftermath of the general election, at the first meeting with public health officials I stated - Deputy Shortall would have been present at that meeting and would have said exactly the same thing - that all of us in this House must accept the centrality of public health advice as a guide to dealing and coping with the pandemic.  That remains my position.  It is extremely important that public health advice is independent and transparent and is seen to be so.  I will give the following commitment: as long as I am Taoiseach, there will never be an attempt, in any shape or form, to undermine the independence or transparency of public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may have overstated the degree to which there has been a change in communications.  All press officers in all Departments have been asked to make sure that NPHET spokespeople are facilitated in going forward to the public media to do interviews, make media appearances and communicate public health advices in the context of Government policy and to explain to people the rationale for the advice that is given.  The Government also decided that we will co-ordinate this so that we do not have six spokespeople out on the one day as opposed to two or three and that there is a synchronising and a proper co-ordination of those appearances.  That is not something anybody can quibble with.  That is the position.  I have checked back on what happened over the weekend and nobody was stopped from going on any show from what I have garnered.  I said what I said at a press outing on Sunday morning in good faith.  This matters to me too and I believe in the independence of NPHET.<\/p>  <p>  I want to make the following point while reflecting on what has happened in recent months.<\/p> <p>I have come to conclusion that, more often than not, referring to mixed messaging is a good way of saying \"I actually don't like the message\".  That seems to me to be the position.  In the House from time to time, people have said that we have not done antigen testing but everyone knows that public health advisers have not been, from the earliest days, the strongest advocates of antigen testing.  There is a robust debate about antigen testing and there is also a robust debate about ventilation.  I believe we should do everything we possibly can on ventilation, and we will, but people move on very quickly from the public health advice and say that the Government is not doing this or that when, on many occasions, it can be because that is the advice.  All of us need to be careful not to fall prey to the inevitable human failing of always seeking to blame the messenger when we do not quite like the message.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700006#D00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638887100,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I presume the Taoiseach is not referring to my party because, as he knows, uniquely among Opposition parties, we have supported the emergency measures.

I have been raising antigen testing in the House for 14 months.<\/p>  <p>  I am worried about GIS and the spokespeople from NPHET, a considerable percentage of whom are public servants.  Some of those involved with NPHET and NIAC are not public servants, but some are.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has established that two HEPA filters in a room will reduce exposure to Covid-19 and other infectious diseases such as flu by 65%.  In November, the University of Cambridge completed a study at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where HEPA filters were put in for five days.  The filters removed all traces of Covid-19 from the air.  They then tested for five days in the same hospital without HEPA filters and Covid-19 returned.  That is very strong evidence.  Orla Hegarty demonstrated the startling fact that half of all those who have died in this country as a result of infection were infected in fewer than 400 buildings.  That is less than 1% of buildings.  I am talking about nursing homes, hospitals and industrial and workplace settings - meat factories and so on - in which there was poor-quality ventilation.  The evidence is very strong.  It is not a silver bullet, but it may be a significant game changer.  Against that background, the Government is talking about using the minor works grant, which is probably just existing money instead of, as New Zealand has done, putting HEPA filters and air monitoring in every classroom.  It should provide the money to purchase them up front and take the necessary action over Christmas.  The Government should add to that hospitals, in respect of which the question of air quality is absolutely critical for the protection of the health workers who the Taoiseach was just praising.  This is what the nurses and medical unions have been calling for for some time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700007#E01800","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638887700,"counter":44,"content":"<p>The Government acts on science all the time in respect of anything we do with regard to Covid-19.  The Minister for Education acted on expert advice.  A working group was formed and advice was given to the Minister for Education on schools.  There is expert guidance regarding workplaces which was issued in the early stages of the pandemic.  Public health officials have been arguing about good ventilation from the get-go.  I quoted SAGE to the Deputy earlier.  It says that it may be of help but it qualifies it significantly.  We issued approximately 35,000 CO2 monitors to schools.  In second level schools there is vaccination of students from 12 to 17 years of age.  There has been a significant wave of Delta in primary schools.  Funding will be made available but there could be different solutions for different schools around ventilation and air quality.  Some may be more medium term.  The immediate short-term solution is portable HEPA filters or some improvement of that kind.  Funding will be made available for that.  However, it is not a silver bullet by any means.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy seems to ignore the advice that public health has given to schools or that the expert working group gave to the Minister in respect of ventilation.<\/p> <p>The Minister got expert advice.  Different publications come along from time to time.  I do not think the evidence about the 400 buildings would stand the test of all public health officials or public health expertise, in terms of narrowing it down to that.  Obviously, in nursing homes where people are resident for a number of years, you are unfortunately going to get a high preponderance and we found that out in the earlier part of the pandemic.  However, that has been much improved because of vaccination, as opposed to having to lock down and stopping people from visiting and so on.  The one game-changer for nursing homes has been vaccination.  Let us call a spade a spade.<\/p> <p> The Deputy can be shocked all he likes about other aspects.  I am open to everything that works.  I am for proven means of ventilation.  I am also in favour of the principle of doing no harm in respect of whatever we provide or we put in.  The resources will be provided where schools feel it is necessary.  I was in a school recently which actually had another alternative solution which was working for it.  It has not had a single transmission.  It was Larkin Community College.  I was shown the particular, unique construction of the school and the kind of defences there.  The 35,400 CO2 monitors are in 4,000 schools across the country.  We will continue to work with the schools.  There is also a technical team available to work with schools as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700008#F00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638888000,"counter":46,"content":"<p>Of course the vaccine has made an enormous difference.

It is clearly not enough because we are asking entertainment, music, taxi drivers and all sorts of people to take the hit once again as we head into Christmas and asking people to reduce their social contacts.  Maybe that is necessary but the Taoiseach cannot absolve himself of the responsibility to do absolutely everything he possibly can to reduce the impact of this virus and the Government is not doing it when it comes to air quality.  When you go into a hospital for surgery, the air in the operating theatre is filtered precisely to prevent the transmission of infection in the theatre.  Why does the Taoiseach think that is done?  It is done because it works.  It stops the transmission of infectious disease through the air.  So the science is clear on this.  It will definitely help.  It could be a game-changer but it will definitely help significantly, yet the Government is delaying.   Why is the Taoiseach not demanding minimum air quality standards and providing the resources, like filters, that will be necessary?

Insurance, the contributions of the many for the losses of the few, is supposed to make our society more resilient.  Our Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was not wrong when he observed that we do things in life, such as playing sport or throwing a child onto a trampoline, that inherently carry a risk.  We have got to manage that risk.  Increasingly, commercial business, not-for-profits, schools, the Government and families are finding it hard, and that they can do less in life, because insurance is not working.  This is <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu<\/i>from 20 years ago.<br\/><br\/>Occupiers' liability remains extraordinarily onerous.  If something happens on your premises, you are to blame, irrespective of the circumstances.  Nothing has happened on the reform of occupiers' liability, despite it being in the justice action plan.  The ink is barely dry on the personal injuries guidelines committee award levels and they are already being circumvented.  There appear to be no repercussions for making persistent nuisance, or even downright fraudulent, claims.  Cases takes too long and take too much out of the people involved in them.  Simply put, insurance costs too much and for many it is becoming impossible to obtain at any reasonable economic cost.  Indeed, what is becoming a parasitical insurance-medical-legal industry crushes the social, cultural and economic vitality of our society.  It is no surprise that that honeypot crushed the troika back in the day.<br\/><br\/>It is surely time to grab the nettle and stop tinkering with tort reform but replace tort compensation with a sturdy social security framework that serves victims without respect to cause or fault.  Tort reform was legislated for in Australia a decade ago and has delivered for that society.  We must do something similar in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700009#G01500","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638888600,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his query.  I noted his comments regarding the cardiac situation in Waterford, which we will continue to pursue vigorously.  I am conscious another Waterford Deputy and Minister is sitting adjacent to me, who is also advocating strongly for that.  I take the Deputy's point on the issue.<\/p>  <p>  On insurance inform, I have a lot of sympathy with the Deputy's comments on the impact of insurance costs on employment, business and enterprise.  That is why it is a key priority for the Government.  The action plan for insurance reform was published in December 2020.  It sets out 66 actions to bring down costs for consumers and businesses, introduce more competition into the market, prevent fraud and reduce the burden on enterprises and community and voluntary organisations.  Some 95% of the actions are due to be completed by the end of 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The first action plan implementation report, published in July, shows that tangible progress has been made.  The introduction of new personal injury guidelines is one example.  Early data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board demonstrates that award levels have declined by an average of 40%.  I take the Deputy's point that we need to see that translated into premium reductions. An office to promote competition in the insurance market has been established, chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance, Deputy Sean Fleming, who is doing exceptional work on this topic.  The Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021 passed all Stages on 15 June.  This will make perjury an offence for the first time and will, therefore, help tackle insurance fraud.  An insurance fraud co-ordination office has been established within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy identified the issue of occupiers' liability.  He will know that the Department of Justice has recently completed a review of the Occupiers' Liability Act, which included the issues of duty of care, notices and waivers.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Helen McEntee, has noted to Government the intention to bring forward legislative proposals to reform the law in this area.  Those proposals are at a very advanced stage.  The Minister has indicated that the heads of the relevant amendments have been drafted and advice has been sought from the Office of the Attorney General.  The planned rebalancing of duty of care with a view to applying a common sense approach to risk is of particular relevance to leisure and high-footfall activities, as it will help to address so-called slips, trips and falls.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is progressing development of a general scheme of legislative amendments to increase the number of cases which are settled by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, without recourse to litigation and he is working in consultation with the Attorney General on the reform of PIAB and legislative reforms in that regard.  A comprehensive programme of action is under way.<\/p> <p> The issue will be, as those reforms are implemented and given effect to, whether we can translate those reforms.  We need to ensure the translation of those reforms into reduced costs for people, such as households, community and voluntary groups and businesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700010#H00200","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638888900,"counter":63,"content":"<p>Insurance is not working, as the Taoiseach knows.  It is becoming unaffordable and unavailable for a significant number of sectors.  Many only have recourse to one underwriter and they have to pay whatever is being asked of them.  The Taoiseach mentioned PIAB and he knows PIAB claims are being circumvented with the attachment of post traumatic stress to soft tissue injuries.  That was never meant to be where we were going in terms of the personal injuries guidelines committee, PIGC.  There has been no attachment of costs to solicitors' practices bringing nuisance cases.  I have not seen any and, in fact, there was one high profile case recently where the judge explicitly refused to do this.  It related to GAA insurance.<\/p>  <p>  The insurance companies are not settling.  They are settling low-pay costs because they do not want to go to the High Court and even when they are getting awards, they cannot recover the costs from the other side.  This is leading to this large level of dysfunction.  When the Taoiseach talks about claims falling, what he is really talking about is the motor insurance industry.  That is the only heading where insurance claims appear to be falling and where premiums are falling.  They are not falling anywhere else.  I have a friend in the sports amenity business who is facing a claim from somebody who broke through a fence, came into the property at night and injured themselves.  My friend is facing a personal injuries claim, as an occupier.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, this is endemic throughout the country if one looks at where the courts are going.

Insurance is a significant cost, whether one is in a household, motoring or in a business.  The Deputy was correct to point to the reduction in motor insurance.  This morning, the Government again adopted a significant road safety strategy for the coming years.  It is interesting when one looks at the number of people who died on our roads 20 years ago compared to now.  The number is stark - in other words, it is far fewer now.  I stand corrected on the figures but it was something like 450 per annum but it is approximately 150 now, which is still too many.  However, it illustrates what good strategies and reforms can achieve.  I recall the howling in the House when the then Minister was introducing drink driving laws and so on.  Deputies were opposing them.  Noel Dempsey was the Minister at the time and the late Gay Byrne headed up the RSA.  However, the results are there to be seen in reduced road fatalities and accidents.  Strategies work.  The agenda we have for insurance reform is comprehensive and will work, but we have to keep the focus on it and make sure it works and translates into reduced costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700011#J00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Messages from Select Committee","time":1638888900,"counter":65,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700011#J00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1638888900,"counter":66,"content":"<p>The Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the Sea-Fisheries (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021 and has made amendments thereto.  <\/p>  <p>  The Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for the public services for the service of the year ending on 31 December 2021: Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700011#J00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1638888900,"counter":67,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700011#J00600"},{"type":"speech","time":1638888900,"counter":68,"content":"<p>The report of the Business Committee is taken as read.

If my Bill is passed, it would establish a statutory Dublin Bay authority charged with preserving for future generations the distinctive character of Dublin Bay and its ecology as a coastal resource.  The authority would have the aim of creating a better framework for environmental protection, governance and improvement of water quality for all of those who use the bay.  The idea is that the authority will create and strengthen a better framework for the protection of one of the great resources that our city has.  Indeed, it is one of the greatest resources that all of us in Dublin have, not just those in my constituency of Dublin Bay South.  All of us in Dublin have strong connections to the body of water stretching from Howth to Sorrento Point.  We have strong connections to the bay.  It is often the first thing we see when we fly into Dublin when coming home.  It welcomes us, it is where many of us learned to swim, sail or paddle and, of course, it is the location for the opening chapter of our greatest novel, <i>Ulysses<\/i>.<\/p><p>I am proud to have worked with a number of people on this Bill, particularly our local councillors in Dublin Bay South, Mr. Dermot Lacey, Ms Mary Freehill and Mr. Kevin Donoghue.  Councillor Lacey in particular has been calling for a model like this for some time.  I have also worked with swimmers from the Half Moon club in Poolbeg and a group that was formed in 2020 arising out of concerns about water quality in the bay, namely, SOS Dublin Bay.  As many colleagues will be aware, the latter's &quot;Save Our Sea&quot; petition has more than 20,000 signatories.<\/p><p>Since the start of the terrible pandemic and throughout the various Covid lockdowns, we know how much the bay has become a place of refuge for year-round and seasonal sea swimmers.  All too often, though, water quality has been poor and swimming has consequently been under threat in the bay.  Biodiversity in the bay, including marine life, is under threat as a result.<\/p><p>We want to establish a statutory authority with a specific mandate to propose and promote policies and priorities for the protection and enhancement of the environment, natural habitats and wildlife and to ensure proper monitoring and regulation of sea water quality.<\/p> <p>The membership of the authority would come from among elected members of the Eastern and Midlands Regional Assembly and others with a special expertise or interest in the future protection of Dublin Bay.  While environmental protection will be a key requirement of the new authority, it would also have a mandate to improve access and facilities around Dublin Bay.  We are conscious that there is an informal task force which has some responsibilities around Dublin Bay but which has no statutory powers.  As a result, there is a lack of co-ordination for the protection and enhancement of this wonderful amenity.<\/p> <p> For decades we have witnessed the crumbling dereliction of the old Sandymount and Blackrock baths and a lack of facilities for those who would like to be able to use the sea and the bay in a more meaningful manner.  We might even see a lido with public access for all swimmers in George's Dock if we establish a new authority with statutory powers that this Bill anticipates and envisages.  Such a statutory model works elsewhere.  For example, on the east coast of the US, a statutory task force was established some years ago for Chesapeake Bay to preserve the future of the bay, improve water standards and encourage greater use of the bay by local people.  That is the sort of community facility we want to see established in and around Dublin Bay.  That is why this Bill is so important.<\/p> <p> At the end of October, I asked a question of the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on water quality in Dublin Bay.  I was seeking to ensure a better system for monitoring water quality for all of us who swim in the bay throughout the year.  On the floor of the House, the Minister disclosed that he, a regular sea swimmer as am I, had recently had an ear infection and wondered if it might be connected to the quality of water in the bay.  I have never, to my knowledge, become sick as a result of poor water quality in the bay, but this is a real concern for many others with whom I regularly swim.  Many of us have concern about ongoing discharges from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant and the potential damage that dredging is causing to the ecosystem and biodiversity in Dublin Bay.  It is not just about human usage of the bay; we also want to protect marine life and biodiversity.<\/p> <p> We need a joined-up and co-ordinated approach to the protection and enhancement of the bay.

In October, 8,830 women, men and children were in emergency accommodation, an increase of 4.2% on September.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (Extension of Notice Periods) Bill 2021 will allow local authorities to determine whether a person or family is at risk of homelessness and this will then trigger an extension in the notice period of that person's or family's tenancy in order to avoid entry into emergency accommodation at the end of the four-week period.  It also proposes to change the tenancy law so that a person or family at risk of homelessness is provided with a three-month extension to their notice period.

Where the housing authority certifies that a tenant, who is under threat to quit, is at risk of homelessness, a three-month extension will be granted.  There will be protections for landlords.  This is not simply postponing the inevitable.  The three months will then be used to help secure accommodation so that families do not become homeless because of a lack of early intervention.

There is a growing opinion across the oversight committee that officials are now intent on pushing out those who voice opinions contrary to the Department&rsquo;s or, worse still, who attempt to hold it to account.

Following a cross-party initiative last week opposing the Department's decision to remove the community and voluntary networks from the national drug strategy oversight committee, the Minister of State, Deputy Frankie Feighan, asked Department officials to engage further on the matter.  While I welcome this intervention, I am sorry to say that my experience tells me not to hold out too much hope as the Department has, in effect, dismantled the north inner-city drug and alcohol task force and closed down the community sector&rsquo;s involvement in its work.<\/p>  <p>  So bad is the situation that the Inner City Organisations Network and the North West Inner City Network, which are long-established bodies, have been left with no option but to issue a joint statement calling on the Taoiseach to urgently intervene.

Nearly one third of older people say they are suffering from increased levels of stress.<\/p> <p>One third of older adults said that they either delayed medical care or that medical care was delayed for them.

The Deputy is correct that there are procurement issues around what happens if somebody pulls out of a project, particularly in public contracts.  As I told Deputy Kelly earlier, I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to engage on this issue and to see what can possibly be done to rescue the provision of that housing.

On the issue of intervening in the jobs market, the point I was making is that there are 30,000 vacancies in the jobs market, which is up from 19,000 vacancies two years ago.  We need to take focused and targeted approaches as we emerge from and evolve throughout the pandemic.  We are not where we were when we were in level 5 and level 3 lockdowns; sectors of the economy are open.  Anyone who has been on the PUP for more than 12 months will be targeted with activation measures to help them secure work.  We will do whatever we can to support those people.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised the TILDA study.  Covid has had an impact and this is a pandemic.  We have provided unprecedented resources across the board, including community supports and mental health supports, to enable people to try to deal with this.  There is no question but that it is stressful for people and it has dampened their future horizons.  Delayed medical care is a sad, difficult and challenging reality of Covid-19, so we will put more resources in place to deal with that.  We are hiring a lot more capacity from the private sector to deal with elective care, in particular, so that we can get operations, procedures and diagnostics done.<\/p>  <p>  The report Deputy Haughey raised is an important framework within which to develop policy on community safety.  In the north inner city last week I saw at first hand the significant progress that was made within that community due to the initiatives that have been taken in recent years.  I am looking to see where wider application of that model can be carried out in other areas with a more multidisciplinary and multi-agency approach to dealing with a range of challenges that communities across the city and in other cities are facing.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has made proposals in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Cian O&rsquo;Callaghan made similar comments on that report and he raised the issue of first-time buyers.  I agree  houses are expensive and we need more supply.  Since the last lockdown we have made a significant rebound in housing and there have been about 31,000 commencements from October 2020 to October 2021, which is good.  The mortgage market is robust with significant increases in the number of people taking out mortgages.  The help-to-buy scheme is helping people with affordability.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has developed a range of affordability measures that are making a difference.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S00700","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Taoiseach's Meetings and Engagements","time":1638894000,"counter":233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S00750"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":234,"qnumday":10,"qnumall":"[57662\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S00900","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on recent discussions with the President of the United States.","asker":"1556","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":235,"qnumday":11,"qnumall":"[57663\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S01000","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will provide an update on his recent meeting with the President of the United States.","asker":"1552","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":236,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[59969\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S01100","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his most recent conversation with the President of the United States.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":237,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[60076\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S01200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on his recent discussions with the President of the United States.","asker":"1504","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":238,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[60201\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S01300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on recent discussions with the President of the United States.","asker":"1478","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1638894000,"counter":239,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[60204\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700020#S01400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if he will report on recent discussions with the President of the United States.","asker":"1628","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638894000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 15, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The relationship between Ireland and the United States is deep and of long standing.

The council explored approaches to the acquisition of indigenous, minority and lesser used languages in early years settings.  I welcomed the opportunity to provide an update to council members through Irish, as a means of showcasing the rich linguistic diversity across the administrations of the British-Irish Council.<\/p>  <p>  The council also discussed the latest political developments, including the ongoing impact of Covid-19 across all administrations and on the protocol.  On the morning of the summit, First Minister Mark Drakeford hosted a breakfast meeting for heads of delegation.  Discussions focused on climate issues in light of recent developments at COP26.<\/p>  <p>  I also had bilateral meetings with the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, and the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and participated in a business programme organised by Enterprise Ireland and the consulate general in Cardiff where we met a number of Irish companies which export to Wales and have a significant presence there.<\/p>  <p>  Regarding my latest discussions with the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, we spoke by phone on Wednesday, 24 November.  I congratulated him on the successful hosting of COP26 in Glasgow and we briefly referenced the latest developments in relation to Covid-19.  We then discussed the Northern Ireland protocol.  I welcomed the continuation of the talks between the European Union and United Kingdom on the implementation of the protocol and said that it was essential that these now lead to substantive progress and joint tangible solutions within the framework of the protocol.  I emphasised to the Prime Minister that it was vital for stability in Northern Ireland, the British-Irish relationship and the wider EU-UK relationship that this would be resolved through agreed solutions.  I reiterated the European Union's commitment to addressing genuine implementation issues and reducing friction and administrative burdens on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  I said it was the view of the Irish Government that the latest proposals from the European Union go very far in seeking to respond to issues raised, especially by the business community.<\/p>  <p>  The Prime Minister stated he was committed to agreeing a deal if at all possible.  However, he highlighted certain areas where he considered further progress was required.  He said he did not wish to trigger Article 16 but noted that it remained a possibility where resolution was not reached through the current talks process.  I repeated our view that any triggering of Article 16 would have far-reaching implications for stability in Northern Ireland, the British-Irish relationship and the wider EU-UK relationship.  We agreed that co-operation between our two Governments is key to ensuring peace and stability in Northern Ireland, which is a priority for both Governments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700022#U02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1638895200,"counter":279,"content":"<p>As the Taoiseach set out, the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council provided the opportunity for attendees to use indigenous, minority and lesser used languages.

What is perhaps less well known is that the Northern Assembly has the power to repeal the anti-trade union laws Thatcher brought in but has failed to do so.  It is somewhat disappointing Sinn F&eacute;in that has not done this.  In order to address this deficit, People Before Profit MLA, Gerry Carroll, has brought forward a trade union freedom Bill to try to undo some of the anti-trade union legislation which is being brought into the Assembly.

He made a very good point on Brexit.  The First Minister of Wales was very clear on the negative impact of Brexit on Wales, in particular the decline in the volume of goods going through Welsh ports.  The Welsh are very worried about the long-term impact on their ports, the consequent impact on local economies and the pattern of trade that is developing in the form of direct links between Ireland and the Continent.  The Welsh Government is very aware of that.  The First Minister of Scotland was also critical of the impact of Brexit.  Importantly, both were very clear in their articulation to the British representative, the Secretary of State, Michael Gove, that they did not need any more disruption around Brexit.  The last thing all of us on the council need is more disruption, such as triggering Article 16 and causing a further row with the European Union.  The very clear message from all the others at the council to the British Government essentially is that it should resolve this within the framework between it and the European Union.  It was quite useful from that perspective.<\/p>  <p>  The British-Irish Council is a formal set-up but the informal side of it is better.  The breakfast hosted by First Minister Drakeford was very useful, in particular on COP and climate and whether we could do more at a British-Irish level, for example, by having our own mini-COP26, which would be a proper conference on what all the administrations can do in respect of climate and energy, specifically wind energy, wave energy and so on.<\/p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, I did not raise trade union rights with the British Prime Minister at my last meeting, a phone call with him, which was overwhelmingly about the protocol.  However, I note the measures the Deputy's party is promoting in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I have not seen the exact details of the Bill.  I favour the right of trade unions to assemble, work and advocate on behalf of their workers.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith again raised the issue of legacy.  I met some relatives of victims of the Glennane gang recently at the request of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I am totally opposed to the British Government's proposal for a number of reasons.  Not only does it prevent the truth from getting out in respect of murder and killings by all groups, it potentially leaves the British Army off the hook in terms of some activities.  There was collusion involving the Glennane gang and loyalist paramilitaries.  There were Provisional IRA killings and murders for which there have been no closure and no accountability.  Families are not getting enough information.  Why the most heinous of crimes would be buried, if you like, by such an amnesty is something I cannot comprehend.  I do not understand how those who perpetrated such crimes should be left off the hook like that without any obligation to be accountable to the families and give them some closure as to who murdered their loved ones.  I say this genuinely.  I saw last night's programme and it was particularly sad for the relatives of those who lost their lives.  They have had absolutely no closure.  No one has spoken to them and it has not been resolved.<\/p>  <p>   Deputy Richmond raised the North-South Ministerial Council.<\/p> <p>Reflecting on this, since the Good Friday Agreement, the institutions have not been working for close to ten years.  There has too much stop-start with the institutions and, therefore, we are going through our current challenging period because of Northern Ireland protocol issues that remain to be resolved between the British Government and the European Union.  That is affecting the operation of the institutions.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I brought a joint memo to Cabinet today updating it on North-South co-operation.  A lot of good stuff is happening with the shared island initiative, which is gathering great momentum.

PNR data is information provided by passengers during the reservation and booking of tickets and when checking in on flights.  The content of PNR data varies depending on the information given by the passenger and may include, for example, dates of travel, travel itinerary and contact details such as address and phone number.  The exchange of this information is to assist in the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime.  The exchange of this data is an essential tool for law enforcement, including countering terrorist threats across the EU and, of course, is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the UK.<\/p><p>Deputies will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required.  The Council intends to adopt this measure by 20 December 2021 at the latest, therefore, it is necessary to secure Oireachtas approval as a matter of urgency and, in light of this, I ask Deputies to pass this motion without a vote.  The proposal provides for an extension of the special arrangements currently in place in the TCA to allow the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK, which in the absence of a decision to extend will expire at the end of this year, that is, on 31 December 2021.<\/p><p>The extension will allow the existing special arrangements to continue to run until the end of 2022.  It is worth noting that this measure makes no policy changes in this area.  As the extension needs to be in place by the end of the year, the latest it can be adopted at the EU Council is 20 December 2021.  Regretfully, this has put us under pressure to complete the opt-in process as soon as possible.  However, as I mentioned, I assure Deputies that the measure is purely technical in nature and does not introduce or amend any policy matters.  In essence, it provides for a continuation of existing arrangements until the end of 2022.  The Government sincerely regrets the lack of time given to the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider this matter, which was not within the Government's control.  Unfortunately, the European Commission was unable to produce the draft proposal earlier than 26 November due to the requirement for internal consultations.  I trust that Deputies understand the urgency and necessity of this motion passing today.<\/p><p>The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK includes arrangements for exchanges of PNR and the protection of such data shared by EU airline carriers to the UK.  An essential precondition for the arrangements as set out in the TCA is that the UK applies data protection standards essentially equivalent to those set out in the EU's standards and complies with specific additional data protection standards.  While EU member states can retain PNR data for a period of five years, the TCA imposes a requirement on the UK to delete PNR data after one year.  This is due to the change in the UK's status from EU member state to a third country.<\/p><p>The UK's PNR data processing systems were originally configured to comply with the requirements of EU law.  As such, their technical systems, including for the deletion of PNR data, operate in exactly the same way as the systems operated by EU member states.  However, the UK currently has no mechanism to operate an automated risk assessment process or to delete PNR data automatically other than upon expiry of a period of five years beginning with the date of transfer.  As such, the UK's system for processing PNR data remains configured as it was prior to the UK leaving the European Union.  However, intensive work is ongoing by the UK to ensure the necessary technical adjustments are being made to guarantee its compliance with the requirements of the TCA.<\/p><p>In the meantime, the UK is operating additional interim period safeguards manually.  This includes operating a manual risk assessment process and manually logging and putting beyond use PNR data that should be considered as deleted.  Due to these circumstances, Article 552 of the TCA provides for a derogation to this requirement to enable the UK to adapt its systems to ensure compliance.  This derogation ends in December 2021.  The TCA allows for two such yearly extensions until the end of 2023.  The UK has informed the Commission that work is continuing on their systems to facilitate this.  It is now in the process of redeveloping its technical systems for processing PNR data to meet the requirements of the TCA and it has requested an extension to the derogation.  Consequently, the Commission has published this proposal in order to facilitate an extension of this special arrangement up to 31 December 2022, thus allowing the continued sharing of PNR data with the UK.<\/p><p>It should be noted that Article 552(11) of the TCA sets out additional safeguards the UK must follow during the derogation period.  In conjunction with the request from the UK, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office carried out an independent review of the safeguards provided for in Article 552(11) of the TCA and confirmed that it is satisfied that the safeguards are in place and are operating as set out in the UK report.<\/p><p>Without the extension of the derogation period, PNR data will cease to be shared between the EU and the UK from midnight on 31 December 2021.  As Deputies will understand, if this were to happen it is something that could potentially have serious repercussions in the fight against terrorism and could impact on the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.  As mentioned earlier, the proposal presented by the Commission includes the use of the legal bases of Article 87(2)(a), making this a measure under Title V of the TFEU.  Thus, Protocol 21 applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt into the measure.  The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received has confirmed that Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required.<\/p><p>To conclude, I emphasise that effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority and Ireland will play its full part in that.  Ireland's role in the EU has changed in recent times and will continue to evolve in the coming years.  Full implementation of the TCA is necessary for us not only to play our part as an EU member state, but to ensure that our post-Brexit relationship with the UK continues to grow and develop.  Part of this relationship is ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens is protected and this measure is necessary to do that.  I trust that the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of this measure.  Ongoing exchange of PNR information with the UK is something that is entirely within Ireland's strategic interest.  I thank Deputies for their consideration of this important matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700024#W00500","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1638896400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>I accept what the Minister of State said that this is a technical necessity and just a continuation of the status quo.  We all accept that it makes absolute sense that passenger name records information is maintained for a certain period.  We all know that we need all the tools that are required to deal with international crime, which is utterly cross-border and, in some cases, technically more proficient than traditional states or even the likes of the European Union.<\/p> <p>We have to get ourselves into the game.<\/p> <p> It hardly comes as a shock that Brexit, the TCA and whatever else have thrown up many anomalies.  People could nearly be persuaded to say that Brexit was not necessarily a great idea, but we are where we are.  Obviously, we want continuity.  What is envisaged when we get beyond this interim period is that PNR information will be maintained for 12 months rather than five years.  The stipulation in this regard is laid down in the TCA between the European Union and the British Government.  I am not sure that this is necessarily a great idea in the sense that when we are dealing with issues relating to international crime and multiple jurisdictions, it can be incredibly complicated and take a huge amount of time.  In that context, information needs to be retained and databases need to be maintained.  We know the difficulties and complications we have in dealing with the financial and banking sector.  All of the complications in question meant that time is needed.  Whether the outworkings of this are a good idea, I am not sure.  However, this extension needs to be agreed here and now.<\/p> <p> We are dealing with a British Government that is looking for this extension because it does not have its systems up to date to allow it to do what it said it would under the TCA.  So be it, but it is very difficult to be dealing with this when the mood music is not great.  I heard a commentator in the past while talk about the feeling in Government circles being that there is a 50-50 chance of Article 16 being triggered.  Nobody believes it will be triggered before Christmas.  That is the saving grace.  Obviously, the behaviour of the British Government has been utterly ridiculous.  I would like to say it has been out of character, but my view of British Governments over many years is that even when you think you have a deal, you do not and the British will go back and try to renegotiate parts of it.  Someone who would have known far better than me about dealing with the British Government over many years had the idea that even if it is willing to go from point A to point B, it will take the most circuitous route possible, and that will give rise to a huge amount of pain for you rather than them.  That is where we are.<\/p> <p> Obviously, this also gives succour to certain elements of political unionism that are, let us be clear, probably in fear of the ongoing discussion in respect of Irish unity.  A huge number of people who would have probably previously fallen into that bracket of being unionists are at least having a discussion.  The thing for an awful lot of people is Irish unity is a means of staying within the European Union and not being allied or wedded to the union with Britain and the madness of dealing with this Tory Government or whatever other Government might be thrown up by the British electorate.  That is where we are in respect of this matter.<\/p> <p> We have had multiple statements and declarations by David Frost and Boris Johnson.  You are not always sure what you are dealing with - whether it is an actual negotiation, a gambit or somebody who is just playing to the home crowd and who will eventually come up with a sensible solution.  The fact is that you do not know.  It provides a certain succour to a type of political unionism that does not want to deal with anything and that has got some way worked up about the sea border when the reality is that, from a business perspective, multiple studies and research work and any of our interactions or those of the Government with business, agriculture and various representatives show that there are definite benefits for the North of staying within the Single Market.  Obviously, there are also benefits to remaining connected with the British market at the same time.  There is an argument that political unionism could be cutting off its nose to spite its face.<\/p> <p> the fact is that many others do see the benefits in this regard.  Commissioner &Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d and the European Commission have tried to come up with solutions, whether in the form of the pledge of an 80% reduction in sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, checks or the possible 50% reduction in customs checks.  All of this can be worked through.  I get that there will still be multiple issues for a long time.  That is the fact of Brexit.  It is fair to say that the Irish protocol was put in place to be a mitigation and to protect conditions on the island of Ireland, where it is no way acceptable for there to be a return of a hard border.  I live in Dundalk, not very far from the Border.  We all know the history that goes with that and nobody can accept going backwards.<\/p> <p> We will eventually see where the British Government stands, but the games it is playing are of no benefit to anybody.  We have to engage robustly with it, on that basis.  There is no choice.  We always have to work from the point of view of maintaining dialogue and attempting to get the best result.  The best result would be that these Frost-&Scaron;ef\u010dovi\u010d talks come up with a solution and that there will be no further threats and, certainly, no triggering of Article 16 or anything else beyond that.  That solution will provide huge benefits for businesses, those in agriculture and others in the North.<\/p> <p> We will also have to deal with the issue of the democratic deficit in the context of the North having to operate under European rules, without having representation.  However, there are multiple methods of doing so, whether it is observer status, certain groupings operating within the European Union and ensuring there is engagement, especially at an Executive and assembly level.  We need to make sure that all of this happens.  It is absolutely necessary.  I get that the mood music is not especially great and we have ongoing threats, such as those from political unionism.  The latter is  probably down to the fact that it is under severe pressure, electorally, both to the left and to the right.  It thinks it can play the trick it has always played of wrapping the Union Jack around it and calling people out onto the streets.  That may work to some degree at election time, but it is certainly not working at present.  It is also not beneficial to a huge number of people.  We want to see definite solutions.<\/p> <p> We also need to look at our solutions here.  I will put it quite clearly.  We are 100 years on from the treaty.  In historical terms, it was a failure of the republican movement at that time not to have a cohesive organisation and leadership or a well-enough worked out strategy to deal with the treaty negotiations.  It was a lost opportunity that ended in many tragedies, one of the biggest being partition.  We have all had to deal with the outworkings of that.<\/p> <p> Until we finish that connection with Britain and with British Governments, we will still have to deal with this madness.  I welcome what has happened, particularly a number of the moves in respect of the shared island unit, whether those be cross-Border infrastructural projects such as that relating to the Narrow Water bridge and the commitments in respect of them, the studies, reports and modelling being considered in the context of the North and the South and how Departments work, educational attainment, economies or whatever other issues we are dealing with or the shared island dialogue being expanded properly.  Those who will be offended are going to be offended.  We need a citizens' assembly.  We need to have a full conversation with everyone who is willing to have that conversation.  Irish unity is coming, and it will be an absolute disaster if we do not plan for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700024#W00600","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638897000,"counter":299,"content":"<p>There is no doubt that the exchange of passenger data is critically important to the UK, to Ireland and to the wider EU law enforcement communities.  So far, the exchange of data has been largely unaffected by Brexit, which was a significant win for the UK.  As a third country, the UK must be held to higher standards than it was previously.<\/p> <p>In this case, the EU has ruled that the UK data protection system is in line with the GDPR and that the exchange of this kind of data can go ahead.  However, we are aware of the rhetoric that has come from Downing Street over the past couple of years.  It shows a desire to break with GDPR rules and this will have to be kept under constant review.  It could be empty rhetoric but we need to watch it closely.  No one wants the UK's national security to be at risk.  It is our nearest neighbour.  Is there a person in the House that does not have some connection to the UK in terms of family members?  However, that does not mean we can accept anything other than the highest degree of compliance with the standards set by the GDPR.<\/p> <p> The Commission made a point of excluding data transfers for the purpose of UK immigration control from the adequacy decisions it adopted in November.  This is due to the ruling in the UK courts that the Home Office practice of denying people their personal data was out of line with the GDPR.  That seems to affect about 60% of people seeking access.  I think it is to do with denying people access to their data.  It is a high number of cases.  Do the transfers of PNR data for the purposes of immigration control continue despite that court ruling or are they on hold until the UK remedies the situation?<\/p> <p> The transfer of PNR data relating to international flights has been common practice worldwide since the 9\/11 attack.  The EU has many agreements with third party countries as a consequence.  Recent judgments by the European Court of Justice have shown that the EU is enforcing increasingly high standards for privacy protections, which is welcome and is needed, especially for agreements formed prior to the GDPR coming into effect.  Passenger name records include names, addresses, phone numbers, credit card information and meal preferences, a detail that can indicate ethnicity, religious belief or political affiliation.  Strong safeguards need to be in place for the exchange and use of the information.

The Council has done due diligence and its strong assessment is that this is the best way to proceed in light of the less than ideal circumstances.  I agree with that recommendation.<\/p>  <p>  Second, it makes sense for like-minded countries, particularly neighbours, regardless of which political bloc they align themselves with, to exchange information from a passenger name record point of view.

As the Minister of State alluded to, the most important reason is from a law enforcement perspective.  It is so that we are in a position to prevent, investigate and prosecute serious crimes by terrorist organisations and organised crime.<\/p>  <p>  Third, I recognise and appreciate that we are here today because of a failure on the British side to implement IT systems and get structures in place.  It is a recurring theme that they did not plan properly for Brexit but there is no point in punishing our nearest neighbour because it is in Ireland's interest that, on 31 December, there will not be not mayhem in the skies and that Irish and European Union passengers will be able to travel freely.<\/p>  <p>  The other reason I am in favour of this is because the current arrangements are superior to those proposed by the UK Government.

This is an annual technical Bill comprising nine sections, all focused on the issue of health insurance.  This legislation is needed in order to revise the parameters of the risk equalisation scheme, which is a financial mechanism that supports our community-rated health insurance market. <\/p> <p>The amendments outlined in the Bill will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the private health insurance market and seek to keep health insurance policies at an affordable and equal price for all citizens, young or older, healthy or sick.  I will begin by briefly outlining the purpose of risk equalisation before providing an overview of the process undertaken to set the 2022 rates and then outlining the specific provisions which will apply next year.  <br\/><br\/>Currently, 46% of the population in Ireland holds private health insurance.  This amounts to 2.3 million people and represents a total annual premium income of more than &euro;2.5 billion.  Health insurance in Ireland is provided according to four principles, namely, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefit and community rating.  Our community-rated health insurance market means that the cost of health insurance is shared across all members of the market.  In general, everyone, with certain exceptions, can buy the same policy at the same price.  Insurers cannot take into account personal circumstances such as health status.  Older and sicker people pay much less for health insurance than they would in a risk-rated market.  Younger and healthier people who are less likely to access health care pay more than they would in a risk-rated market.  As young people grow older, their health insurance needs may increase and they too will be supported by community rating.  This principle is called intergenerational solidarity.<br\/><br\/>Community rating is supported by the risk equalisation scheme, which has been operational in Ireland since 2013.  In essence, the scheme is a financial transfer mechanism whereby money flows from insurers with healthier members to insurers with sicker members in the form of credits.  These credits are funded directly by stamp duty levies on all health insurance contracts when those contracts begin and these levies flow into the risk equalisation fund.  Without the scheme, an insurer with older and sicker members would be forced to charge much higher premiums than its competitors to cover its claims costs.  None of the stamp duties on health insurance contracts goes to the Exchequer; they are all used to fund risk equalisation credits.  The risk equalisation fund is managed by the Health Insurance Authority, the independent regulator of the health insurance market.<br\/><br\/>The risk equalisation scheme requires state aid approval from the European Commission in order to function as part of the private health insurance market.  The current scheme was approved in 2016 following negotiation with the Commission, with similar schemes approved and in operation in Ireland since 2003.  To date, the scheme has been considered a state aid which is compatible with the internal market by the European Commission.  The current scheme is approved to operate until 31 March 2022 and was extended from 31 December 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19.  Negotiations are at an advanced stage with the European Commission for the new scheme and are expected to be finalised by the end of the year.<br\/><br\/>As Deputies will be aware, a health insurance Bill is needed each year to update the amount of credits paid to insurers under the scheme and the corresponding stamp duties required to fund them.  In addition to these standard technical amendments, this year's Bill provides the legislative basis for the introduction of high-cost claims credits to the scheme.  Furthermore, the Bill provides for an updated benchmark of reasonable profit and the introduction of a time limit for insurers claiming from the fund.  I will set out the detail of these amendments shortly when outlining the specific provisions.  These updates are based on the recommendation of the Health Insurance Authority.  Each year, the authority carries out an evaluation of the market, focused on the claims costs that every insurer has paid over the year.  This evaluation includes information on market conditions, which is particularly important in recent times as Covid-19 continues to have a large impact on the market.  Based on that analysis, the authority recommends the level of credits that should apply for the next year.  Significant work has also been carried out by the Health Insurance Authority in the past few years in relation to high-cost claims and how high-cost claims credits will be introduced to improve the effectiveness of the scheme.  The authority has provided several reports to the Minister for Health on this new addition, including a final recommendation in June of this year following an open consultation which involved health insurers and members of the public.<br\/><br\/>I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.<br\/><br\/>Section 2 amends section 6A of the principal Act to include high-cost claim credits in the definition of risk equalisation credits which the insurer is entitled to have paid on behalf of an insured person.  This section also proposes to insert new definitions for high-cost claim, high-cost claim credit, high-cost claim quota share and high-cost claims threshold.  High-cost claims credits will work by targeting claims costs over a threshold of &euro;50,000 in a rolling 12-month period and compensating the insurer for 40% of the claims cost over this threshold.  Currently, health insurers receive no subsidy for these claims.  The hospital utilisation credit is the only credit paid related to the health status of customers and is paid when an insured person accesses hospital services.  The high-cost claims credit will increase by 25% of the amount of the fund paid directly for health service usage.  High-cost claims arise in the Irish health insurance market where an insured person is extremely ill and attends hospital for an extended period and are closely linked to chronic conditions such as cancer.  Health insurers must pay claims costs where they are medically necessary and are covered by the insured person&rsquo;s contract.  This new type of credit intends to target subsidies towards the claims costs of sicker customers.  This will support the objective of community rating.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 3 amends section 7E of the principal Act.  It provides that the Minister may require the Health Insurance Authority to furnish a report relating to the high-cost claims credit parameters.  The Health Insurance Authority will include the level of high-cost claims credits that should be paid out of the fund, and the basis on which they will be paid, in its annual report and recommendations to the Minister.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 4 amends section 7F of the principal Act to provide for a new benchmark of reasonable profit and for transitional arrangements for how it is to be applied for the three-year periods 2020-22, and 2021-23.  The benchmark of reasonable profit is used to assess whether an insurer has been overcompensated by the risk equalisation scheme.  This is currently set at 4.4% return on sales, gross of reinsurance and excluding investment income.  This was agreed with the European Commission under state aid rules in 2015.  This section amends the 4.4% return on sales to 6% on the same basis.  This was based on the recommendation of a new benchmarking exercise among European and Irish insurers.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 5 amends section 11C of the principal Act to provide for a new effective date for revised age-related credits payable from the risk equalisation fund.  This section also introduces a time limit on all risk equalisation credits that can be claimed from the risk equalisation fund.  There is currently no time limit or cut-off period in the Act restricting how long a health insurer may have to make a claim to the fund.  Introducing a cut-off for claims on the fund is expected to have benefits from a data management, administrative and financial reporting perspective for the Health Insurance Authority.  There will be a transitional period where health insurers will have an opportunity to submit any claims, which are backdated before this new time limit is introduced.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 6 replaces table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act.  This table provides for age-related credits, which are payable for insured people over the age of 65.  These new credits would be payable from 1 April 2022.  This year, the Health Insurance Authority has recommended a marginal decrease in the age-related risk equalisation credits to facilitate the introduction of high-cost claims credits.  Age-related credits provide a subsidy for insurers who provide cover for that cohort.  These credits cover the expected extra claims costs for insured older people.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>Section 7 amends the principal Act by the addition of Schedule 5 which provides the parameters for high cost claims.  These are the high-cost claims threshold which will be set at &euro;50,000 and the high-cost claims quota share, which will be set at 40%.<br\/><br\/>Section 8 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.<\/p> <p>This will specify the stamp duty rates that will apply for 2022.  As I outlined earlier, the scheme is Exchequer neutral.  It is not funded by the State and the State does not derive any funds from it.  The amount of stamp duty levy is calculated to offset the costs associated with the payment of risk equalisation credits.  Any surpluses or deficits that arise under the scheme are rolled over and included in the recommendation for the following year.<\/p> <p> Covid-19 has had a major impact on the private health insurance market in Ireland, as it has on the entire public and private health sectors.  The pandemic has restricted utilisation of hospital services, which has impacted claims activity, thereby causing fewer risk equalisation credits to be paid out.  That has caused a surplus to arise in the fund.  This section provides for a reduction in the stamp duty levy applicable to health insurance contracts from 1 April 2022, which incorporates a surplus of &euro;100 million that had gathered in the fund.  The amount of stamp duty payable varies, depending on whether a contract is advanced or non-advanced.  The difference between the two is how much private hospital coverage the contract offers, with non-advanced contracts providing for mostly public hospital cover.  The stamp duty on advanced health insurance contracts will be &euro;406, a decrease of &euro;43 from 2021 rates.  For non-advanced health insurance contracts, the stamp duty will be &euro;122, which is a decrease of &euro;35 from 2021 rates.  It is hoped these reductions can benefit customers by way of a reduced premium charged by insurers next year.<\/p> <p> Section 9 provides for the Short Title, commencement, collective citation and construction of the Bill.  The provisions in the Bill relating to the introduction of high-cost claims credits and the amendment of the benchmark for reasonable profit are subject to approval by the European Commission under state aid rules.  The commencement of these provisions will be done by ministerial order.<\/p> <p> To summarise, this Bill allows us to maintain the community-rated health insurance market.  Its provisions will increase the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme, which is a fundamental support to the market.  I conclude by highlighting the Government's commitment to improving public health services under the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  As access to these services improves, the proportion of people who hold health insurance may decrease over time.  Importantly, the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland, thereby ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare.  While such a high proportion of people hold health insurance across Ireland, it makes sense to maintain the community-rated health insurance market.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700026#Y00600","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638898800,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I am sharing time with a number of colleagues.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill, as we always do.  It is an annual Bill to renew the risk equalisation mechanism that supports the community-rated health insurance market.  The Bill revises the stamp duty levy on policies and the risk equalisation credits payable to insurers for 2022.  It is a self-funded system.  The Bill also provides this year for high-cost claims credits, which will provide an additional layer to smooth the costs of credit allocation by directly subsidising very high-cost outliers, subject to European Commission approval.  Risk equalisation ensures costs are constant across the lifespan of the individual.  It seeks to ensure, where possible, that age, gender and health status do not influence the cost of an insurance product.  Recognising the reliance of many people on health insurance, we will support the Bill, as we have done in previous years.<\/p>  <p>  I take this opportunity to reiterate our critique of the current insurance market and the two-tier healthcare system in this State.  The Minister of State restated in her opening remarks the Government's commitment to the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare and the commitments contained within it.  The people who resigned their positions and walked away from the implementation of the programme would disagree that the level of urgency and commitment that should have been given has, in fact, been given.  I do not doubt at all that additional funding was made available in last year's healthcare budget, but it followed a decade of underinvestment.  Moreover, as we know, most of that money was not spent and was rolled over to this year.  Even still, many of the staff and beds that were promised were not delivered and potentially will not be delivered.<\/p>  <p>  A total of 45% of people in this State rely on the health insurance market, not because they want to take out private insurance but because they feel they have no choice in the matter.  How can we blame then when we look at the waiting lists in the public system?  There are 900,000 people on some form of health waiting lists, despite all the promises we had from the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his predecessors that we would see waiting list strategies.  In fact, the head of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation body, who has resigned her position, is on the public record as saying there was a waiting list strategy already there and ready to go but it simply was not published and advanced by the Minister.  Why is that?  All we are seeing is waiting lists going in the wrong direction.  It is bad enough that 900,000 people are on some form of public health waiting list but 200,000 of those patients, many of them children, are waiting more than 18 months.  That is the reality for many people.<\/p>  <p>  I do not have time to go into all the promises made as part of the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  Commitments were given to enhance community care, which would involve more investment in community and primary care and ensuring people are treated, as far as possible, in their own home in the first instance and, for people with chronic pain and cardiac and respiratory illnesses, that their care would be managed in the community.  This is not possible for many people because the community infrastructure simply is not there.  Anyone to whom I have spoken who knows what he or she is talking about when it comes to healthcare says the HSE simply does not understand the community sector.  It has outsourced huge amounts of public money, as we know, to section 38 and section 39 organisations and, indeed, to a large number of private organisations, when it comes to the delivery of home help and home care packages.  That is the reality of what is happening.<\/p>  <p>  One of the representatives of HIQA who came before the Oireachtas health committee a number of months ago when we were discussing the private nursing home sector and the subsidies the State pays for the sector, said: \"The HSE does not understand the private sector that it spends so much of taxpayers' money on.\"  I would say the executive also does not understand the community sector.  I have put in parliamentary questions, as other Deputies do all the time, trying to establish where all the money goes, how many community beds are funded and how many staff there are in all these organisations and across all the different layers of community care.  We get different responses or, on some occasions, no response because the data are not available.  That is crazy when one considers the billions of euro of taxpayers' money that goes into community care.  Much of that care is not driven by the HSE and is not publicly owned, managed and controlled.  We then have all the issues that flow from that, with section 38 and section 39 organisations paying wages below HSE rates and not being able to attract staff at the same level as the HSE does because of the terms and conditions of employment they offer.  We know there is a need to overhaul this sector.  Community care is an area in which there has not been investment and where the step change that was needed, which Sl&aacute;intecare promised, has not been delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The two major areas in which very little progress has been made and that are relevant to this Bill are, first, removing healthcare from public hospitals and, second, expanding universal GP access and free GP care.  On removing healthcare from public hospitals, we had the Sl&aacute;intecare report in the first instance, which set out a strategy for how that would be delivered.  It was followed up by the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, which again set out a clear strategy for delivering this objective in terms of public-only consulting contracts and grandfathering out those consultants who remain on the types A and B contracts, with some form of enticement, if possible, for the latter to move onto the public-only contracts.  Very few advances were made in this regard.  Despite there being the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, we still have not made any inroads in this area at all.  That will continue to be the case until the political will is there to do it.  The lack of action is driving much of the private sector activity in healthcare, which is embedded in our public hospitals.  We need, once and for all, not just to agree but to deliver on the commitment to disentangle private healthcare from public hospitals.<\/p> <p>The cost of that, according to the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, was &euro;700 million.  Juxtapose that with the &euro;200 million private sector funding that was made available as part of the winter plan, the access to care fund.  That is in addition to what has already been paid in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  That is an additional &euro;200 million, the vast majority which will go into the private sector and into private hospitals.  Yet, the cost of removing private healthcare from public hospitals would be &euro;700 million.  In the general scheme of healthcare funding, that is not a huge cost.  It strikes me that cost is not the problem here but it is the political will to make it happen.  It is not happening.  It was a big promise that was made but it simply is not being implemented.<\/p> <p> The expansion of free GP care will be important if we want to ensure people come off private health insurance and that we wean the State away from subsidising private healthcare through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and all of the short-term measures the Government comes up with at the last minute as we go into winter to give a veneer that it is doing something to deal with waiting lists and the crisis in hospitals.  All it is doing is outsourcing more funding and giving more funding to the private sector.  We need to grapple and deal with those two big issues that I have outlined.<\/p> <p> Look at what happened in budget 2022 in relation to expanding free GP care.  It was meant to be done by 2023, as I understand it.  We are nowhere near that.  What was funded in the budget was for seven- to eight-year-olds, I think, to receive universal GP access.  That is still being negotiated.  There are still ongoing talks with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  Even though it was funded, it still has not been implemented.  In fact, many people who are medical card holders have problems getting access to some services already.  Bloods, for example, is one of these services.  There are huge challenges in that area.  Despite the commitment to move to universal GP access for everybody within a five-year period of Sl&aacute;intecare being committed to and delivered, it has not happened.<\/p> <p> I am afraid that when the Minister of State and the Government give themselves a pat on the back for what they have done in healthcare reform, they only have to look at the people who are tasked with responsibility for doing that.  The chair of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation advisory council, SIAC, walked away.  The person who was the lead in the HSE for delivering Sl&aacute;intecare walked away.  The vast majority of people, or many of them, on the advisory committee walked away.  That is being restructured.  The Minister has given responsibility to the Secretary General in the Department and the head of the HSE.  However, there has been no sense of urgency from those two individuals in regard to those two big issues.  As long as that continues, we are going to be back here every year.  Yes, this is technical legislation but I am not prepared to continue to support a two-tier system, which is broken and which does not work for the vast majority of patients.  I want to see urgent delivery on the commitments that all parties signed up to in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It strikes me that some people and some political parties who signed up to Sl&aacute;intecare did not believe in the principle of it.  If they did, they would have moved much quicker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700028#AA00200","speaker":"1615","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638899400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak about this Bill.  It is an issue that is dealt with every year around this time, in a similar Bill to provide for risk equalisation.  Risk equalisation is a mechanism designed to give effect to the objective of a community-rated health insurance market, where customers pay the same premium for the same health insurance plan, regardless of age, gender or health status.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Insurance Act has provided for a risk equalisation scheme for the market since January 2013.  Under the scheme, insurers receives risk equalisation credits to compensate for the additional cost of insuring less-healthy or older members.  This year&rsquo;s scheme will differ from the current one by introducing high-cost claims credits.  Treating these claims separately will mean that the risk equalisation subsidised provided to insurers will be more accurate and effective by removing distortive high-cost claims.<\/p>  <p>  As a result of lower claims activity due to Covid-19 a surplus of around &euro;100 million has built up in the risk equalisation fund.  The Health Insurance Authority has recommended the return of this &euro;100 million to consumers by the way of a reduction in stamp duty for contracts commencing or renewing in the period of 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023.  This is likely to be a once-off reduction because of Covid-19 imposed restrictions on access to public and private hospitals, which resulted in lower credits being paid out of the fund.<\/p>  <p>  Some 45% of the population is covered by private health insurance and pay out more than &euro;2.5 billion in premiums.  For many workers and families, health insurance is a necessary evil.  They make great sacrifices to pay for it, hoping that they will never have to use it.  The only reason they pay is that our health system is so bad and they fear the long waiting lists in public hospitals.  There are hundreds of thousands of people languishing on long waiting lists and this Government has no credible plan to address this.  We need to fix the imbalance in healthcare to remove private healthcare from our public hospitals and our public healthcare system.<\/p>  <p>  It is time we moved away from a two-tier health system.  There are many people falling through the cracks, who earn too much to qualify for a medical card, or too little to afford health insurance.  This is wrong.  Ability to pay should have no bearing on how we are treated in the healthcare system.<\/p>  <p>  People are languishing on waiting lists and are getting sicker, while those with health insurance are fast-tracked to the front of the queue.  In some cases, they are treated by the same doctors and, in some cases, the same hospitals.  For those who have to wait, their mental health is suffering and in some cases their life expectancy will be lowered.  The Minister of State is aware that we have discussed our elderly many times.  This is not good enough and health insurance exploits a failed public health system.  It is a public health system that is being killed off by successive Governments to favour a private health system.  As with the commodification of housing, the commodification of our health service is hurting those who need it most, like our elderly and like those on low income, in other words, the working poor.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a lady last week who has been waiting for more than three years for a tonsillectomy appointment for her child.  She was initially told that the wait would be 18 months.  If the family had health insurance, it could be done within a week.  Instead, the child endures pain of recurring sore throats - six in the last year.  Children are suffering and it is a disgrace.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government will deliver an all-Ireland health system that is free at the point of delivery and one that is based on need and not on income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700029#BB00200","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1638899400,"counter":311,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make a brief contribution this afternoon.  The Minister of State said the programme for Government commits to retaining access to private healthcare services for people in Ireland and ensuring choice for those accessing healthcare and that while such a high proportion of people hold health insurance across Ireland, it makes sense to maintain a community-rated health insurance market.  It would make more sense to have targeted investment and specific planning in our public health service.  That makes real sense.  An all-island health service would also make sense.  Of course, for the moment and for as long as those who are intent on strangling the health service have control over it, there will always be a growing market for private health insurance.  Governments such as the one in power at the moment will always lead the charge and act as a great advertisement and a great recruiter for the private health insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  Just so the Minister of State is aware, people do not get private health insurance because they want to skip the queue, get one-up on their neighbours or, in many cases, because they can afford it.  Many people cannot afford it and they go without, just to have private health insurance.  I do not have private health insurance.  I am lucky that I have never needed it, touch wood.  I would not get it as I do not support it.  I live by that but I know many people who have it.  They do not favour private health insurance, but they do not want to find themselves on one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s waiting lists.  They do not want to find themselves having to wait years in pain simply to see a doctor.  They find the money somewhere to ensure they can pay for private health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State acknowledged that we have a high level of private health insurance in this State.  I do not think we have a high level, or a disproportionately high level, of people who favour private health insurance.  They simply favour being able to see a doctor when they need to see a doctor.  They cannot do that in the public health system very often.  The Minister of State knows all of the reasons.  Just because the Minister of State does not fix it does not mean she is not aware of what has caused it.  She knows the reasons our health service has the waiting lists that it has.  She does not deny it - in fact, she was nearly celebrating it there in her statement.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, we have this debate every year because we have to have it.  It is a necessary debate and I fully appreciate that.<\/p> <p>However, it would be preferable to hear a credible plan from the Minister proposing the legislation to ensure such a massive incentive for private health insurance is not stacked into our public health system.  We live in hope.<br\/><br\/>While I have the floor I will raise an issue that affects a very small number of people.  I ask the Minister of State to look at this or get someone in her Department to do so.  It relates to restricted membership undertakings, RMUs, that is, where a person is a member of a scheme by virtue of the fact that they are married to someone in a particular type of employment, such as the Garda.  I am not specifically referring to the Garda medical aid but that is one example.  If someone is married to a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na they are covered under their spouse's scheme.  The scheme was devised when we did not have divorce but if such a couple got divorced then clearly that person would not be covered by the scheme anymore as they would not be a spouse.  However, there is no obligation in the legislation for them to be told of this.  There is no obligation in law for the spouse who is being divorced from the serving member to be told and that can create problems because of the way the insurance market is structured.  That person, through no fault of their own because they might not know their former spouse discontinued their membership of the health insurance scheme, can find themselves on the outside of the health insurance market, and it is harder for people to get private health insurance in their mid to late 50s.  In the case that was brought to my attention, the person involved only found out by accident that they did not have private health insurance.  It is a very small and niche thing but it is something that could be addressed.<br\/><br\/>I asked a parliamentary question about this matter and the response stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tIn the case where a person ceases to be a dependant of a member, for example where they cease to be married to the member of the medical society or where their spouse ceases to qualify as a member, an RMU is not obligated to continue to provide insurance cover to that person. <\/blockquote> <p>That is fine but they are also not obligated to tell these people.  I am not saying there are large numbers involved here but a small fix would be in order.  I am using the opportunity this afternoon to bring this matter to the Minister of State's attention.  I am happy to discuss it with her afterwards but she might get someone to have a look at it.  It is a small thing but since it has happened once there is a small chance that it could happen again and it would be appropriate to have a look at that.  I thank the Minister of State for her attention on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700029#BB00300","speaker":"1467","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638900000,"counter":313,"content":"<p>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak.  Annually, we have a debate about the health insurance Bill wherein we establish the regulations and legislation around the private health insurance sector.  It is a difficult thing for those of us who have fundamental issues with how the Irish health sector is set up at the moment, and how it has been set up for many years.  In the past two years the deep problems of our healthcare system have been clearly exposed for all to see.  As a State, we operate a two-tier health service and we attempt to operate these systems in tandem while not having enough capacity within our service to meet the basic public need.  That is underlined by massive issues in recruitment and retention.  Essentially, our health system is failing to cope with the basic needs of the State and has been for many years.  This has led 2.2 million Irish residents to have private health insurance.  That is 45% of the population.  In the UK, the figure is 13%.  While the NHS is not perfect - far from it - it is one of the great achievements of public health in Britain that the vast majority of its population do not pay for for-profit health insurance, because they believe in their health service.  They strive for their health service to be better and they are invested in it.<\/p><p>It is not just about comparisons with the UK.  According to the WHO, Ireland is &quot;unique among EU countries in not providing universal coverage of primary care.&quot;  It states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIts system of entitlement to publicly financed health care is also complex ... gaps in coverage in Ireland already create significant financial barriers to access, particularly for people who do not have medical cards or [private health insurance], resulting not only in unmet need but also in inequitable and inefficient patterns of use ... these barriers are often substantial relative to most other EU countries, especially for primary care. <\/blockquote>  <p>That is absolutely damning of our health system and we know it.  We see the outworkings of it every day in our advice clinics, in our communities and in our families and we discuss the outcomes in various debates in this Chamber.  Much of it boils down to the complexities of the two-tier system and trying to unravel that.  Believing that Sl&aacute;intecare is the answer to that is slightly misleading.<\/p><p>Sl&aacute;intecare, if delivered in its entirety or nearly in its entirety, would not replace private health insurance.  It would create what will hopefully be an attractive alternative to private health insurance, namely, a public health system in which people have so much confidence and that has such ease of access in terms of cost across many different aspects of healthcare that we feel we do not need private health insurance.  That is a huge offer of faith in terms of a health policy.  Most people are behind Sl&aacute;intecare, or say they are, but even if it is delivered we will still have a private health insurance market in this country.  It will still be actively touting for business from Irish residents and will be coming from a position of huge advantage because of where it is at the moment, the facilities and resources it has and because it is unconstrained by having to provide pure holistic public health policy.  It is a huge ask just for Sl&aacute;intecare to be delivered and then we have this offer of faith that if it is delivered it will be so attractive and function so well that the private health insurance market will be diminished to an extent similar to the UK, where it only covers 13% of the population.  That feels light years away in the Irish context.<\/p><p>We need to have some hard conversations about what Sl&aacute;intecare can and cannot achieve.  I do not have faith that Sl&aacute;intecare will achieve what we need it to when it comes to our reliance on private health insurance.  A reliance on private health insurance is what the State has at the moment.  That is something we need to move away from.  Looking at news articles on private health insurance, two consistent trends are clear.  You will see the price of health insurance going up and the profits of health insurance companies going up.  What you will not see is waiting lists in the public health system coming down or costs for health insurance coming down.  Inequality is widening.  Due to the way we have it currently set up this House is hamstrung.  No matter what your ideological bent, because of where we are right now this Bill will have to pass.  However, we will back here again next year having a very similar debate.  Even if great strides are made and we catch up on the delays and make strides where we need to, Sl&aacute;intecare is not going to fundamentally solve the problem of our two-tier health system and the hold private health insurance companies and private health providers have.  We need to get real in that debate.  We are where we are with it now.<\/p><p>It is another example of a deeply flawed structure within our health system.  As I said, we see its outworkings across many areas.  We have a huge recruitment and retention problem.  Part of that is due to the fact that private healthcare providers can provide better pay and conditions for staff who are then taken from the public health system.  Consultants are working in both private and public healthcare and so the same person on the same list could be offered the same consultation 18 months or two years down the line or they could have it in a week or two with the same person, sometimes in the same room.  That is just immoral and that has to change.<\/p> <p> Turning to our GPs and the pressure they are under, our primary care sector has performed Herculean tasks over the past 20 months, but Covid has laid bare just how stretched the sector is.  Real investment in public and primary care will have to come hand in hand with an approach to private health insurance that removes the guilt factor for people who feel that they need to have insurance.  It is fantastic if people who are on their own do not want to get private health insurance and decide to take their chances, but if their circumstances change - they get married and have families or other dependants - the pressure on many to stretch their household budgets to include private health insurance tips hard-working people who are just trying to get by onto the edge of the poverty line.  This is because they do not have the primary care access that they need and the certainty such access brings.  Every Deputy knows and understands that but not everyone is providing the solutions to change it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700030#CC00200","speaker":"1564","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638900600,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I enjoyed the research on this Bill, mainly because a constituent came to my clinic last night who raised the issue and brought along his and his wife's private health insurance policy.  He had noted that the premium for 2022 compared with the premium for 2021 had reduced but the credit for the risk equalisation had also reduced, resulting in little change in the overall cost of his premium.  He was wondering about the risk equalisation piece.  I am in a much better position today to tell him, having read through the research, briefing notes and some other bits and pieces.  Notwithstanding everything that has been said because this is, to use a term that has been used this week, part of the peculiarity of the Irish health system, I was amazed that this couple in their 70s were paying almost &euro;3,000 between them for their health insurance for the year.  That is unacceptable in this day and age.<\/p>  <p>  Like every other Deputy present, I strongly support Sl&aacute;intecare and yearn for the day when there is universal free healthcare, universal access to healthcare on an equal basis and good and decent healthcare.  I do not just mean universal access, but universally timely access to every sort of procedure, every sort of consultant and every sort of care that is necessary for individuals.<\/p>  <p>  I am also mindful, though, of the great Republican Party slogan during an election a number of years ago when the Democrats were putting forward the virtues of Medicare and Medicaid, an issue that arises consistently in the USA.  The Republicans had a scary slogan: \"If you think health care is expensive now, just wait until you see what it costs when it's free\".  Something that strikes me, and that was mentioned by another Deputy, is that we will always have people who can access private healthcare.  Even if we had the resources in the morning to produce a universal healthcare system, there would probably be a splurge in the development of even more private hospitals, including private specialist hospitals.  There would then be an even more striking elite with access to that kind of healthcare.  However, there is no aspect of Sl&aacute;intecare that is not virtuous.<\/p>  <p>  I was lucky enough to go to and graduate from college.  When I got my first job, my parents' advice was to take out a pension and private health insurance.  It was part of the DNA.  I never thought I was gaining superiority over anyone else.  I just assumed it was something that everyone did and to which everyone had access.  It was a seamless decision in a world that probably was not characterised by as many inequalities and inequities in terms of accessing the health system.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the legislation and the reason for the risk equalisation fund being revisited every year have been well rehearsed by other Deputies.  It is a good.  Whatever about having private healthcare, imagine if we had a system of private healthcare like the system in the US, which is unbridled and unfettered and where no account is taken of someone's age.  In fact, the older one gets and the more likely one is to get sick, the larger the payments one must make and health insurance moves out of ordinary people's reach.  I am not giving bouquets to our system.  Far from it.  I believe in an equal system and it is what we all strive for.  I certainly strive for it.  For example, and to go slightly off topic briefly, the National Treatment Purchase Fund could be used to provide access to psychological services that are otherwise not available.  As a society, we could examine this matter.  I recently had a case of a child who waited four years for an assessment and, after getting that assessment, must now wait another four years for treatment.  The child will have gone through every developmental phase by then.  It will be over developmentally for that child.<\/p>  <p>  We understand that the reason for the risk equalisation fund is to ensure that people who are in their advancing years and who are more likely, although not always, to become more ill, develop ailments or require hospital admission or specialist care do not pay any more than younger cohorts who are regarded as being stereotypically fit and health.  I wish to make two points on this.  I enjoyed reading the Health Insurance Authority's paper on this matter.  It was well explained, provided good background information and was detailed, but the authority only had 20 respondents to its public consultation.  That is risible.  The Health Insurance Authority ought to be more robust in its public consultation.  It could request that all private health insurance providers include a consultation piece in correspondence to all their members, including a feedback form and the authority's questions.  The questions that the authority asked were legitimate and explained to many people the need for risk equalisation, but when one thinks of the millions of people in Ireland who have their health insured privately, that there were only 20 responses to the consultation indicates there was something lacking.  We need to do something about it.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State will be aghast to know that there are more than 380 different health plans.  The bulk of them are held by Irish Life.  Next is Laya, with VHI holding the fewest plans.  Regularly, Claire Byrne and Pat Kenny do the State some service when they have a specialist on who tries to navigate the public's way through the myriad of plans.  How can anyone reasonably hope to get value for money in a health insurance plan?  I am confident that there are thousands of people who, if they had a helping hand in buying their private health insurance, would save a great deal of money.  We could do the State some service, to use that phrase a second time, if we asked the health insurance companies whether they really needed so many plans.  I believe Irish Life has 180.  Why does a health insurance company need 180 different plans?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700031#DD00200","speaker":"1572"},{"type":"speech","time":1638900600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>We are all dealing with a situation where a large number of people engage private health insurance.  It amounts to 45% of people in the State.  On some level, this Bill, which is a process that we go through every year, is an element of accepting the failure of our system, in that we do not have the public health system that people deserve and require.  We all accept the necessity of this legislation and that, through risk equalisation, we insert an element of fairness into a system that is unfair across the board.  There has already been much comment on the need to deliver a national health service and the promises of Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p> <p>That is what Deputy Lahart and others said when they talked about universal, timely access.  That is what is required within a system that works.  If people had some faith in Sl&aacute;intecare, it has been rattled by the fact that some of those involved in shaping its delivery have walked away from it.  That emphasises the point that we must be serious about this.  We need to put a coherent plan in place and deliver upon it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Cullinane spoke about some of the other gaps we have in the system.  We do not have an adequate primary care system which gives rise to a hospital-centric system.  That has created particular difficulties during the pandemic, whereby people who could have their care delivered in the community in primary care and other settings are not getting the care they require, which means more people go through the logjam that is the hospital system.  That is before we get into private healthcare being operated in public hospitals.<\/p> <p> In the short time remaining, I will deal with waiting lists.  We could talk about the numbers in hundreds of thousands.  When my youngest child had an issue with glue ear, he required two operations to release it.  I heard an interview with a lady whose son had been on a waiting list for 18 months, or possibly even longer, and she spoke about the damage done to his ear during the period.  There was a lifelong impact on his learning.  That is the cost of the system we have.  We must put in place a public healthcare system that delivers for people.  It is not beyond the Government to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700031#DD00300","speaker":"1498","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638901200,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Insofar as the purpose of the Bill is to get the approval of the House to establish the risk equalisation mechanism in order to support community-rated health insurance, and the decision must be taken on an annual basis, I have no difficulty with it.  I recognise it for what it is.  In the context of a private health insurance market, it is better that there is risk equalisation, lifetime community rating and so on, in order that people who have certain illnesses or are of a particular age that would make them more likely to develop illness are not penalised.  The principles underpinning that are good.  They were agreed many years ago, in 2013.  In the context of the private health insurance market, risk equalisation improves it and makes it fairer and better.<\/p>  <p>  From that point of view I do not have a difficulty with the Bill, nor do I have a difficulty with the additional provision in this year's Bill, which specifies the amount of risk equalisation along with a high-cost claims credit to enhance the risk equalisation.  This credit will assist people of different ages and those who are unlucky enough to have serious illnesses and end up in hospital receiving very expensive treatment and staying for long periods of time.<\/p>  <p>  The original risk equalisation was to provide something of a level playing pitch among different insurers and ensure the VHI in particular, which had a greater proportion of older members, would not be disadvantaged relative to other newcomers to the market.  Just as risk equalisation was agreed, it is also important that there is equalisation to address a situation where an insurer has a disproportionate number of people with serious illnesses and therefore much higher claims.  That is a positive development in this year's proposal.  Insofar as it goes, I agree with that in the context of the private health insurance market.<\/p>  <p>  I made the point on the previous occasion we dealt with such a Bill that we are having the wrong conversation.  The conversation should be about how we run and fund the health service.  At the moment, for many historical reasons, including undue influence of business and significant vested interest within the health service, we have a two-tier health service.  It is a totally dysfunctional health service that achieves neither the best health outcomes nor the best value for money.  That does not make any sense.<\/p>  <p>  We have never had a properly functioning public health service, going back to the establishment of the State.  In the 1950s, there was the mother and child scheme and all that flowed from that in terms of the political opposition to it.  That is sometimes underrated.  We hear a lot about the religious objections to the mother and child scheme, but the objections from the medical profession were just as strong, if not stronger, and they were supported and, let us say, indulged by the political system at the time.  It is incredible that we still have not achieved proper, free public healthcare for mothers and children.  It is outrageous.<\/p>  <p>  We are a complete outlier when it comes to the rest of the Europe.  We are the only European country that does not have a single-tier universal healthcare system.  We are also the only country in Europe where a large majority of the population must fork out the full fee to see a GP.  That is just unheard of anywhere else.  In most European countries, primary care is free at the point of access.  There are other countries where there is a nominal or small charge to see a GP, but we are the only country where large numbers of people must fork out &euro;60 when they want to see a GP.  That makes no sense at all.  We should be encouraging people to get early access to healthcare so that when they have an ailment they get it seen to and treated at an early stage, rather than having a situation where an awful lot of people simply cannot afford to visit a GP because the cost takes too much out of their family budget.  As a result, people leave conditions to fester and get worse and often end up having to go to accident and emergency units or being admitted to hospital for much more serious treatment.<\/p>  <p>  Early diagnosis and intervention are key in healthcare.  For this reason, rather than being scared of people visiting their GP too much, we should be encouraging them to avail of primary healthcare at an early stage to ensure there is early intervention, which is very important, and they are enabled to return to full health as quickly as possible and make a full contribution to society.  That is not the attitude that is taken.<\/p>  <p>  The very fact that nearly half of the population feel they have no choice but to take out private health insurance is damning of the State and successive Governments.  Ireland, alone in the European context, has utterly failed to introduce a modern, universal public healthcare system.  It is an absolute tenet of any modern democracy that there is a properly functioning public health service.  We have utterly failed to provide that since the State was founded.<\/p>  <p>  We are told that this legislation is about achieving equity and equity of access to private health insurance.  I accept that is what it does, but the other issue of equity - equity of access to healthcare - is much more important.  Private health insurance enables people to buy access.  That means skipping the queue and going ahead of other people.  We must consider why people do that.  The reason is that it enables them to get early access to healthcare.  We all want that.  We have such a dysfunctional system.  People on very low fixed incomes, who cannot afford private health insurance, will sacrifice many other things to be able to pay a health insurance premium.<\/p> <p>It is such an appalling reflection on the state of our health system that people have to scrimp and save and make all kinds of sacrifices in order to achieve the kind of assurance that when they need healthcare, they will get it.  We should not be putting people in that situation.<\/p> <p> Others have spoken about other countries where, even with a properly functioning public national health service, people still take out private health insurance.  Yes, they do and that is fine and they are welcome to do that, but the state is not promoting that, nor is the state subsidising it - that is the whole thing.  In the UK, there is the NHS and it was originally very good, although starved of funding over recent decades, undoubtedly.  However, even in that situation, almost 90% of people in the UK are more than happy to use the NHS.  These include people on good incomes, high incomes and all of that and they are perfectly happy to use it because it is accessible, they can get seen to quickly and they are happy with the standard of the service.  People talk about the NHS and the fact there are waiting lists and all of that, but it is a measure that the vast majority of people in the UK are happy to use it.  They give out about delays and so on, but they are happy to use it.<\/p> <p> That is not the case in Ireland.  As I said, almost half of the population feel they have no choice because the public system is so unreliable.  A Deputy spoke of a couple spending &euro;3,000 on private health insurance and that is probably at the lower end of the scale.  However, even where people fork out a number of thousand euro per year for private health insurance, and for the kind of peace of mind that gives them, it is still very bad value for money.  They still have to pay to see a GP, they still have to pay to see a consultant, they have to pay to see a physiotherapist and they have to pay through the nose for diagnostic tests because these things, in the main, are not covered.  It is about getting into hospital; it is about skipping the queue and getting early treatment in hospital.<\/p> <p> It is bad value all round but it also creates that dysfunction within our two-tier system.  There are all kinds of perverse incentives within our two-tier system so there is a huge pull factor for people to buy private health insurance and there is also a huge pull factor for staff to work in the private sector.  The bottom line in all of this is that the better the public healthcare system is, the less profit there is to be made in the private sector.  Equally, one would say that the worse the public healthcare system is, the more money there is to be made in the private healthcare system.  There is never money made out of people being well.  There is money made out of people being sick.  If the public healthcare system does not work properly, as ours does not, if it does not meet the needs of the people, then it provides that huge incentive for the private sector to profiteer from the provision of healthcare.<\/p> <p> That has been aided, abetted and facilitated by successive Governments down through the years.  There are moral questions about that.  It is a fundamental failing of government that the Government is incapable of providing a public healthcare system where equity of access to healthcare is guaranteed.  Access to healthcare is fundamental to our existence for all of us.<\/p> <p> That was where Sl&aacute;intecare came in.  It was to achieve the kind of universal public healthcare system that, as I said, every other country in Europe has.  There was cross-party agreement on that.  Regrettably, the progress on implementing it has been desperately slow.  Successive Ministers have been happy to wrap the Sl&aacute;intecare flag around them and talk the talk of Sl&aacute;intecare, but not actually deliver the fundamental reforms that are contained in it.  Unfortunately, earlier this year, we had the very high-profile resignations of two key people who were charged with leading out the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  Again, that is absolutely damning of this Government and the last Government and their failure to give political commitment to the implementation of the universal public healthcare system.<\/p> <p> We are told that those two people have been replaced by the Secretary General of the Department and the chief executive of the HSE.  It is a very disappointing move because if the Department of Health and the HSE were capable of reform, they would have done it long ago.  They are not capable of reform.  There is institutional resistance to reform.  The idea of putting the two senior people there in charge of the rollout of Sl&aacute;intecare is laughable in many ways.  We need political courage and we need political commitment to the principle of equity of access to basic healthcare.  That is what has been lacking, that is what we need to see the Minister doing and we need the full Government behind that.  Implementing fundamental radical reform of the health service is something on which we must have cross-government support.  The Taoiseach has been running away from this, as have the Ministers.  It is the responsibility of the entire Government to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare.  This Government will be judged on its failure or otherwise in respect of that, rightly so.<\/p> <p> It is also important to acknowledge the principles that were identified in terms of the emergency response over the last two years to the dire situation we face in the context of the pandemic.  At an early stage, it was recognised that we have to treat everybody the same on this.  Because there was a complete lack of capacity within the hospital system, the private hospital system was brought in and created that additional capacity in terms of hospital beds generally, of staff, of ICU beds and of high dependency unit, HDU, beds in particular.  We could not have survived without that.  However, in terms of accessing those, there was a very important principle, which was that access would be on the basis of health need.  To a large extent, that is how the country has survived the full impact of the pandemic because the healthcare system became a single-tier system, so access to healthcare was on the basis of need, not ability to pay.<\/p> <p> Imagine that through the big waves of Covid, and we are currently on the fourth wave, we were saying to people they could only get treatment for Covid if they could afford to pay.  It would be totally intolerable.  Imagine if we said to people they could only get access to vaccines if they were prepared to pay and if they were not able to pay and could not afford it, tough luck, they go to the back of the queue, they do not get the vaccines and they do not get the protection.  That is exactly what we are saying to people who need other life-saving care.  We are saying it is available to them if they can afford to pay, but tough luck if they cannot because they go on a long waiting list.  We have to realise that this is such a basic thing for people and that the Government has such a responsibility in regard to ensuring proper access.<\/p> <p> There are a couple of further points that need to be made.  The first is in regard to the understanding about Sl&aacute;intecare.  Some people think they will not be allowed to have private health insurance under Sl&aacute;intecare.  That was never the case.  If people want to buy private health insurance, they are free to go and do it.  However, the whole approach in Sl&aacute;intecare was that we would develop a high quality, universal healthcare system so people did not feel they had to take out private health insurance, irrespective of whether they could afford it or not, and I have used the example of the NHS.<\/p> <p> We know, of course, that the Exchequer directly subsidises private health insurance to the tune of &euro;377 million.  However, that is only the topline figure that we are aware of and in a whole lot of other areas where tax relief is allowed for healthcare, the figures are not even collected by Revenue in such a way that they can be reported.<\/p> <p>There is a huge element of hidden cross-subsidisation by the public purse of the private system, which again is bad value.<\/p> <p> The other thing provided for in this Bill that I cannot understand is in section 4.  The Bill proposes to increase what is referred to as the benchmark of reasonable profit from 4.4% to 6%.  I do not know what the justification for that is.  Health insurance companies are profitable and we know that when people get their annual notice to tell them what their premium is, many do not just accept that.  Rather, they pick up the phone and tell their health insurer they have received a better quote and ask if it can do something about that.  Within seconds the company agrees to drop the premium by 5% or 10%.  We should encourage everybody to do that when renewing their insurance and people get that immediate reaction if they ring up, say they got a better quote and threaten to leave.  If companies can drop their premiums in an instant then why are we saying their reasonable profit levels should go up?  I ask the Minister of State to explain that.  We know the health insurance sector was worth &euro;2.64 billion last year so it is a massive market.<\/p> <p> Some 47% of people in Ireland are paying for expensive private health insurance.  What does that contribute to the overall health spend in the country?  It is an amazing figure.  It only contributes 13% to the overall health spend in the country.  The public purse, which is funded from people&rsquo;s taxes, funds the health service to the tune of 69%.  There is massive cross-subsidisation from the public purse to the private sector.  That figure tells it all and it is quite startling.  We need to start making progress on this.  What we have done on Sl&aacute;intecare so far is not good enough; the public deserves better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700032#EE00200","speaker":"1567","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638902400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>This Bill primarily deals with risk equalisation, which seeks to ensure that costs are constant across the lifespan of the individual and are not influenced by factors such as age, gender and health status.  It is the only element of equality that is brought to the private health insurance market.  The fact that this must be done shows how it divides ready access to healthcare in favour of those who can afford to pay the costs associated with private health insurance.<\/p>  <p>  According to the Health Insurance Authority, the average price being paid by policyholders on 1 January 2021 across all levels of products was &euro;1,440.  It is a massive amount of money that many people simply do not have to spare, especially when the cost of living is rising at such a rate.  It is indicative of the inequality within the system that ability to pay for private healthcare determines how quickly you get seen.  It is not just me or Sinn F&eacute;in saying this.  Recent research by the Economic and Social Research Institute found that patients with private health insurance receive both outpatient and inpatient care more quickly than those without insurance.  This is the two-tier health system that has long been promoted by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in order to make up for the shambles they have presided over when it comes to resourcing our health service.  This is evident in the fact that under the Governments of the same two parties, Sl&aacute;intecare has been ignored to such an extent that only recently, two top board members stepped down from the programme because of the lack of urgency in its implementation.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State should ask any of the over 900,000 constituents who are on the waiting lists.  Sl&aacute;intecare called for a maximum wait time of ten weeks for an outpatient appointment and ten days for a diagnostic test.  Let us take Tipperary University Hospital as an example.  Of the 3,979 people on the outpatient list, 1,799 or just under half have been waiting over six months or 24 weeks.  This is why we should be discussing universal healthcare where timely access is not dependent on how much you can afford, or on how much you are prepared to scrape together in order to avoid the lengthy lists.  Privatisation seems to be the buzzword of this Government.  The Minister of State will be aware of St. Brigid&rsquo;s Hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.  It has been closed by this Government and the public was told that private nursing homes would be relied upon instead.<\/p>  <p>  Public community care is on the way out and community inpatient care will be on the chopping block if this Government has anything to do with it.  In talking about beds in the community, will the Minister of State tell me if funding is being allocated in the national development plan for refurbishment of the wonderful Dean Maxwell Community Nursing Unit in Roscrea, and if the deadline of 1 January after which long-term stay residents will not be accepted will be extended?  While we are talking about private healthcare, why is the Government not talking about providing proper funding to voluntary mental health organisations like CARMHA in Nenagh?  It is doing tremendous work for people with addiction and mental health issues but it is facing the prospect of possibly having to close its doors in the new year if it cannot secure funding in the near future.  CARMHA is operating on local donations alone, since the funding it received under the Rethink Ireland initiative has run out.  It makes a huge contribution to our health system by providing services that are in short supply overall.  I have written to the Minister of State asking her to meet CARMHA to discuss the issue and I hope that she will do so.<\/p>  <p>  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il recommended ceasing all private care in public hospitals and achieving a model where private insurance would no longer confer faster access to healthcare in the public sector, but would be limited to covering private care in private hospitals.

It is no secret that People Before Profit and I do not believe in a two-tier health system.  Even though we have a two-tier health system, I think the vast majority of people in this House do not believe in that system any more.  If you look at other countries around the world that have a universal healthcare system, the outcomes are much better.  The Minister of State can call me old fashioned or out of date but my party and I are ideologically driven by that and in favour of universal healthcare.  That is why we will not vote for this Bill.  It compounds the inequalities in our health system.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Health Insurance Acts have to be renewed every year to bring a sense of solidarity and equality into private healthcare.  The inequality in this is that we need to examine is the question of why people need to get private healthcare in the first place.  Many Deputies have said that half of the population in this country have access to private healthcare and you would have to question why that is so.  If you put the facts on the table it is clear that the vast majority of people believe in public healthcare and they also pay for it.  The reason people take out private health insurance is that they believe they will be waiting X amount of months or years for access to public healthcare.  That is correct, and Governments have allowed that to happen.  Once a parallel system is in place in healthcare or in any area, you will have inequality.  That inequality cannot be escaped once that parallel system is in place.  Vast amounts of money are spent each year on public funding of private healthcare.  This money drifts off and I argue there is no cost or social exchange to that.  This is at the heart of a system that has gone wrong.<\/p>  <p>  I want to go back to last year when the State took over 19 of the private hospitals in the State.  I hope that in the future there would be no such thing as private healthcare, as people having to jump the queue or as people having to seek out private healthcare.  There should be one system of healthcare.  I do not know if the Minister of State believes in that personally or on a political basis but all evidence shows that where a healthcare system is universal and there are no stages to it the outcomes are much better.<\/p> <p> The NHS in Britain is revered more than the royal family.  It was founded after the Second World War because of what the British working class went through during the six years of that war.  If the NHS had not been set up, there would have been a revolution in Britain because working people had enough of suffering and wanted a cradle-to-grave public healthcare system.<\/p> <p> Many things have changed over the past 18 months.  This public health emergency has showed us many things good and bad, but mostly good.  Humanity has stepped up to the plate and public medicine has done so as well.  Many things have gone wrong that cannot be fixed here, but one of the main effects of the ongoing public health emergency is that people and governments are asking themselves many questions.  They are asking what is the right thing to do and what people want most from life and society.  Some of those questions emanate from the last general election, which was defined by a number of issues, the main one being public service and our health system in particular.  When asked if they want a health service that delivers, regardless of whether patients are on social welfare or millionaires, the vast majority of people in this country will say that they want a health system for all.  The qualities of solidarity and equality that are the main thrust of most healthcare systems in Europe place them at the cutting edge.<\/p> <p> I do not know if Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il can ever change their ideology.  I do not think so because they are embedded in the market system of healthcare.  On a personal level, the Minister of State might agree with me that there is no basis for a two-tier health system but actions and words must match.  We can talk about Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a good policy, but is it largely aspirational?  We will see.  We have been talking about a universal health care system for many decades but people will be judged by their actions.  Can we deliver for the citizens of this country a system of universal healthcare?  I believe fundamentally that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in government cannot do that.  Once we have private healthcare in our system, we will always have inequality.  That is why we need transformative change in how politics is done in this country.  Unfortunately, that will not happen with Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700034#GG00300","speaker":"1565","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638903000,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  In this House on 9 November, the Taoiseach suggested, in response to comments from Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n about the reconfiguration of Navan hospital, that the Deputy should visit Roscommon University Hospital to see the expansion in the range of services there.  I noticed that the Taoiseach said that when I was not present.  He might have taken a different approach had I been present.  However, having said that, I want to see if the Taoiseach is prepared to live up to his words and I hope that we can see some progress in relation to services.  It is true that elective services have improved in Roscommon hospital but ambulance services have not.  We also have the scandal that more services could be made available and more people could be treated in Roscommon University Hospital were it not for the deliberate blockage by the Saolta Hospital Group of the provision of the sterilisation facilities that are so urgently required.<\/p>  <p>  I have with me a letter from the then Minister for Health, dated 9 October 2018, regarding the progression of the central sterile services department, CSSD, at Roscommon University Hospital.  In fact, a state-of-the-art room in the hospital has been lying idle since 2018 because funding for the equipment has not been provided so that we can fully utilise the two theatres at Roscommon University Hospital.  While some parts of the country are struggling in terms of staffing, we actually have the staff to run our theatres but we do not have the sterilisation equipment to ensure that we can maximise the throughput of patients.  We have patients from right across the west of Ireland and the middle of this country who are waiting in pain on waiting lists.  Some are waiting, sadly, to go to private hospitals, via the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to access treatment that could easily be available at Roscommon University Hospital if the funding was provided for sterilisation facilities.<\/p>  <p>  A headline from a local newspaper on 25 October 2018 reads, \"New CSSD Unit for hospital confirmed\".  That was on foot of a commitment I obtained from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, at the time.  The newspaper outlined that agreement had been reached between Roscommon University Hospital, HSE Estates and the Saolta Hospital Group to proceed with the unit.  The then local Senator, now Aire St&aacute;it at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, said at the time, \"Based on my discussions with Minister Harris, I am confident this project brief will be progressed to design stage as quickly as possible next year\".  He went on to say that he had \"repeatedly highlighted the need to put a long-term solution in place\".  Absolutely nothing has happened since then.  A brief was prepared and presented to the steering group on 13 November 2019 and there it has sat since.<\/p>  <p>  On 15 September 2020, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, told me in reply to a parliamentary question that further information was currently being collated in order to future-proof the decontamination requirements of the whole Saolta Hospital Group.  That had been going on for 12 months at that stage.  The Minister went on to tell me that the HSE had advised him that this exercise would be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020.  However, I was told in a recent reply that this is exactly where the project stands today.  We have been waiting for three years for the naval gazing to finish because the Saolta Hospital Group and HSE Estates are determined not to fit out a state-of-the-art building.  I will tell the Minister of State what is in that building today.  The Minister for Health visited Roscommon University Hospital recently to see the new endoscopic facilities there.  He passed by the door of the CSSD unit.  Inside that unit are walking frames, crutches, beds and wheelchairs because it is now being used as a storage facility.  This is a facility that could be used to help to provide treatment to people who are waiting in pain.  Instead of that, those people will eventually, through the NTPF, access that treatment in private hospitals.  It is just not good enough that for the sake of a small amount of capital funding, we cannot fit out a building that is there already.  It is very disappointing.<\/p>  <p>  As the Minister of State will know, I have tabled an amendment for Committee Stage that we will deal with tomorrow.  I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, or one of the other Ministers of State in the Department will be taking Committee Stage.<\/p> <p> The reason I am questioning the commitment in respect of Roscommon University Hospital is because there is a lack of commitment generally within the health service to our smaller hospitals.  The difficulty is that, in the main, consultants do not like travelling.  They do not like travelling from the regional centres to the smaller hospitals where there is capacity, where patients can be treated and where we could address some of the monumental backlogs and waiting lists we have.  If consultants do not travel, it does not happen.  I can give practical examples from what has happened in Roscommon.  The Taoiseach is right that the services have increased there and that, thankfully, we have a problem with car parking at the hospital.  However, that is because we have had two very progressive consultants who happen to come from County Roscommon, who have dramatically expanded the services there and who provide services that are the envy of any other hospital in the country in the context of urology and plastic surgery.  Why is it that we have to rely on our native consultants to provide those services?  Why are we not seeing other consultants from within the Saolta Hospital Group providing services?  Saolta was the first hospital group established in the country.  It had claimed that it was committed to expanding the services and the level 2 hospitals, but that is not happening.<\/p> <p> Tomorrow we will see the exact same thing happened with my amendment and health insurance.  This will be the fourth year in a row that I will raise the specific issue of smaller hospitals not being covered by Irish Life Health.  It has specifically discriminated against the smaller hospitals that could help to ease some of the pressure of the bigger hospitals across the country.  To be fair to the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, back in 2019, he did give a commitment to look at the matter.  However, the current Minister for Health in a recent reply to a parliamentary question told me that he will not be doing that.  I was told that Sl&aacute;intecare is being implemented, that it is about taking the private health insurers out of public hospitals and that we will use smaller hospitals as guinea pigs in that context.  If we want to use guinea pigs, surely it should be the major hospitals that we use because you would start with where there is huge pressure on beds and waiting lists.  Of course, that would have an impact on the consultants, the same consultants who will not travel to the smaller hospitals, and they do not want to see their income being impacted in the regional centres.  That is why the smaller hospitals are not being protected by the Government in the context of the decision taken by Irish Life Health.<\/p> <p> I will make two final points.  I echo the comments of colleagues, particularly Deputy Shortall, on Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is imperative that we do drive forward with the reform relating to Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, that does not mean we should use the small hospitals as guinea pigs for it when clearly we are not - as with the example I gave in the context of Roscommon - prepared to put the capital investment in to deal with it.  The Minister of State should not come in and spin this yarn to me that the Government is not putting the thumbscrews on Irish Life Health because we want to use the smaller hospitals to drive forward the Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  If that was the case, the Government would be putting the capital investment into the smaller hospitals but that is not happening.<\/p> <p> I want to see Sl&aacute;intecare come to fruition.  We need a single, unified health system.  That is why, along with former Deputy Michael Harty, I insisted during the negotiations on the programme for Government in 2016 that there be an all-party committee established to look at this matter and to set down a long-term plan for our health system.  That was because I had seen during the previous 15 years I had been in politics that it all depended on the Minister who was it behind the desk on a particular day.  As soon as that Minister left, the permanent government would revert to form and the new Minister would come in and would have to start the battle again.  It was important, therefore, that there was consistency across Government and political parties.  It is imperative that, despite the push-back from the permanent government, we see the Parliament, parliamentarians and politicians taking ownership of Sl&aacute;intecare and driving it through.<\/p> <p> This legislation will reduce the cost of insurance but this will only happen in April when the bulk of people will have already renewed their health insurance.  I actively encourage every single person who gets a renewal of their policy to please shop around because there are significant savings to be made.  There are a number of companies out there which specialise in that.  I actively encourage people to go to those companies, shop around and make those savings, because that will bring about some of the change that is needed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700035#HH00200","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638903600,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  We are talking about reducing the amount of money paid to insurers by way of risk equalisation on the basis of the criteria of age, gender and level of cover, also known as age-related health credits.  We are introducing a new system of high-cost claim credits and reducing the stamp duty payable on all health insurance policies that feed into the central support fund.  I presume these actions have been costed and are deemed to be beneficial or else I do not expect the Minister of State would have proposed them.  She indicated that the scheme is revenue neutral and that any surplus or deficits that might occur will be rolled over into subsequent years.  She has noted the high take-up of insurance which stands at 2.3 million.  That is to be applauded.  However, I would also point out that there is a large discrepancy between policies, as the Minister of State knows well.  People tend to gear up their policies as they grow older because, notwithstanding risk equalisation, the chances are that policies at the lower end will not cover you for some of the serious health obstacles you may face as you age.  As mentioned by previous speakers, there may be a couple of pensioners paying between &euro;3,500 or &euro;5,000 for a high-level scheme.  That seems very difficult for people who have generally paid tax all their lives.  It may be that this Bill will deal with some of those inequities.<\/p>  <p>  Private and public hospitals and private and public work have been raised several times during the debate.  It is very hard to compare what happens in the public hospital sector with what happens in the private hospital sector as they generally relate to different streams of activity.  Someone in the private hospital system will be looking for fast, straightforward, repeatable exercises that you can turn around and that basically create fee income.  That is what private hospital care is largely based on.  The public system is the social contract that we have whereby we decide that we will look after everybody regardless of their health needs.  That also includes those with very chronic health needs across a range of medical areas who require lots of care and ongoing treatment both in hospital and in community.  That cost is picked up largely by the public purse.  When we talk about Sl&aacute;intecare, therefore, we are talking about trying to get the efficiencies of the private system while having public good at the heart of the policy.  It will be a very difficult circle to square, to be quite frank, because there is a great deal of work to be done to try to generate that.<\/p>  <p>  Others have spoken of the need to implement Sl&aacute;intecare, but I would point out the significant obstacles in the recruitment of qualified medical personnel.<\/p> <p> At present, we are engaged in talks on a new contract for hospital consultants.  Many newly qualifying doctors will tell you they are not going to work in the public system for the contract that is being offered to them but are going to emigrate instead.  Thus, we will have spent the money educating them but we do not have any system or bursary to provide medical training that would contract them to work in the system for one, two or five years, as is done in other countries.  We just educate them and let them fly.  At the other end of the scale, there are people who have worked as hospital consultants for 20 or 30 years and may still have time to run on their contracts but they are not going to stay in the system much longer because, quite frankly, they have had enough of a lot of it.  We have much reform to deliver on that.<\/p> <p> I raise also waiting lists, tests and scans.  Deputy Naughten has just highlighted how level 2 hospitals can do much of this work and I agree.  They should certainly be funded by the private health ensurers and that is an easy initiative to put in place if the will is there.  There are also a couple of schemes around the insurance-backed long-term care.  I point to the VHI Hospital@Home, which is system where a VHI patient whose needs are chronic, not acute, may be able to get minded in his or her home.  Essentially, VHI will pay for people to come and deal with the patient at home.  That is a very efficient system for releasing beds in our public hospitals as well as in the private ones.  Similarly, there is the outpatient antimicrobial therapy, OPAT.  At the moment, we have patients coming into hospital and taking up a bed for half a day or a day to receive antimicrobial therapy.  That can be done quite easily in the home if we have the nurses or qualified doctors to do it.  I am aware there is a pilot being discussed at the moment but we do not need to pilot that.  This is simple stuff.  We should just decide we are going to do it and see what resources we have to do it with.  I will be supporting Deputy Naughten's amendment.  It is discrimination against model 2 hospitals that any health insurer would not be paying for procedures that they pay for in other hospitals.  They are the same procedures.  I agree with him they should not be remunerated under the fund until that case has been levied.<\/p> <p> As I said, I wonder if Sl&aacute;intecare is realistic in the form we are currently discussing.  The Minister of State knows I have been around healthcare for a long number of years.  One of the things I have notice about many policy discussions is they generally do not include those who actually have to deliver the service.  We talk about what we are going to do on efficiency but we do not speak to the nurses.  We talk about what we are going to do on high-level clinical management but we do not speak to the clinical nurse managers and we rarely involve the consultants, to be quite frank.  I do not take the view, as other Deputies might, that somehow the consultants are an outlying class in medicine and all out for money.  I know very many who are quite the opposite.  They are very much pastoral people and their first inclination is to serve, mind and look after their patients.  We have created the consultants' contract they work under and many of them are quite happy to work under the system.  However, they want support and the proper resources.  They want resourcing at junior levels that is adequate to their needs, that is, they need registrars, house officers, junior doctors, clinical nurse managers or secretaries.  The consultants are getting tanked off, basically, because when they go into the system they do not have that.  That is why we are hearing so many people saying the system is dysfunctional.  The system is difficult and it will remain so while public healthcare is offered to all.  We must learn from the efficiencies in the private sector and see how we can bring them across into the public sector while getting risk and payment equalisation for all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700036#JJ00200","speaker":"1616","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638904200,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because it provides important measures to ensure age and health status do not lead to price discrimination.  However, it would be a real dereliction of my duty as a TD if I did not take the opportunity to outline the current state of healthcare provision in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  I think all parties in the House have at some point given a commitment to working towards a universal public system where people are treated on the basis of need and not on ability to pay but are we actually any closer to providing meaningful healthcare reform?  No, we are not.  Are we any closer to that universal, national health service?  No, not really.  That is why 40% of people in the country rely on health insurance in a market worth &euro;2.5 billion annually across three main providers.  The number of people availing of and reliant on private health insurance has increased consistently since the recession.  One of the main reasons for that, and the reason people who can ill afford to spend hundreds if not thousands of euro on these premiums annually do so, is fear.  They themselves fear they will get sick or that a family member will, and we all know the fastest route to assessments and treatment is private health insurance.  That is a fact.  It is one I find abhorrent but it is a fact nonetheless.  It is also indisputable that those who cannot afford private health insurance are left languishing on a public waiting system watching the days, weeks, months and in some cases years go by as they wait for that all-important appointment to arrive.<\/p>  <p>  I have a constituent who maintains that while the official cause of death of his beloved wife was cancer, in reality she died from poverty.  She had gone to the doctor and was waiting for an appointment for scans and diagnostic tests but without private insurance time was passing by and her condition was deteriorating.  Martina presented to her doctor while in severe pain.  Frustrated and concerned the GP rang an ambulance and she was admitted through accident and emergency, where she got the necessary tests and the treatment began.  She was in hospital for her fourth dose of chemotherapy when her first public appointment letter arrived.  Now, her widower is left torturing himself with the what-ifs.  What if they had private health insurance?  What if her diagnosis and treatment had begun sooner?  It is hard to dispute his logic and his conclusion that his wife died because she did not have insurance and therefore did not have access to the timely care and treatment she so desperately needed while she was still alive.<\/p>  <p>  There can be no denying we have a two-tier healthcare system that needs to be phased out once and for all.  The reality is that people get treated more quickly based on their monetary work and their bank balance rather than their health needs.  That shameful situation needs to end.  We should have no more cases like Martina's.  There should be no more tortured widowers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700037#KK00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1638904200,"counter":329,"content":"<p>This health insurance Bill is about looking at the risk equalisation scheme for all health insurance providers.  This is one of the many Bills that have been brought forward so the amount of money paid to the health insurance companies by way of credits can be reduced.  These risk credits are paid on the basis of age and gender.  Risk needs to be spread so newer entrants coming into the market also bear the cost of risk.  The money paid into the equalisation fund comes from a stamp duty paid from every policy sold.  There are two distinct pay-outs, namely, risk equalisation credits and hospital utilisation credits.  Risk equalisation makes it easier for insurers to carry higher risk profiles, for example, those with higher medical costs because of age, medical history etc. so they can compete in the market with other providers.  As happens with all insurance claims, there must be an incentive for the insurance companies to fight a claim.  On this, instead of paying out excess amounts, the Government is now proposing to pay a portion of the claim.  This should also help reduce the stamp duty paid on all policies.  Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, will revise the section relating to equalisation credits, health credits and the high-cost claims.  I understand this will be enacted in January 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, indicates 644,458 people are now waiting for their first appointment.  The number of people waiting on a day care procedure is 74,662.  This is harrowing and very upsetting.  The NTPF also pointed out 217 people have been added to the public hospital waiting list every day since the start of the year.<\/p> <p>Some nine people every hour are added to our waiting lists.  The Minister of State said earlier that costs are escalating in hospitals.  Where is the money going?  People are paying insurance to sit on a chair for a day or two or to sit on a trolley for a day or a week.  Where is the money going, if it is not going into front-line services?  It is not going towards paying our nurses.  Most of the positions that have been advertised are managerial or administrative.  Why are so many of our Irish nurses leaving the public hospital system?  Some of them are going to private hospitals and some are leaving altogether because of the way some of the hospitals are being run.<\/p> <p> When will we audit the CEOs of all the public hospitals and the management system?  I will make it very clear that a public hospital should be run the same as a private one when it comes to its management system.  I see that private hospitals, if they are not run properly, will not stay in business.  I am the person who said in this Chamber that some public hospitals have shorter waiting times, shorter waiting lists and their patients spend less time waiting on trolleys and chairs to be seen.  One or two of the public hospitals have an ongoing record, since the CEOs were appointed to them, of a situation that is spiralling out of control.  I am disappointed to say that one of the hospitals with the highest numbers is always University Hospital Limerick.  I want the management and CEO structure in that hospital to be audited and checked to find out why it has the largest number of people waiting on beds.  Why does it have the largest number of people waiting on trolleys for hours and hours, and even days, to be seen?<\/p> <p> The front-line staff are not the problem; it is the management system.  We cannot, at any stage, blame our front-line staff, especially when other hospitals do not have the same issue.  Public hospitals do not have the same issue.

I want to know why the hospital system has changed so much.  When I was in Barrington's Hospital as a young lad, which is now a private hospital, a patient was released no later than 11 a.m.  If that patient was not well enough to be released by then, he or she stayed in.  The structure of the bed system meant the patient stayed in until the following morning when rounds were done by doctors and consultants and, if the patient was fit and well enough, he or she was released.  I receive reports day after day from the hospital system of people being released at 7 a.m., 9 a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.<\/p>  <p>  The system is completely wrong.  It is a management system and not a front-line care system.  All public hospitals need to introduce a system whereby a patient who is not released by 11 a.m. is not released at all.  In that way, those working in front-line services are given the chance to go to the computer to check whether they have five beds free on a given floor and will know what they have.  There will not then be nurses ringing upstairs and downstairs to see if a bed is free for somebody who needs it.  That is where the chaos arises.  It is a management and structural problem and not one of front-line staff.  That change has not happened.<\/p>  <p>  I am in the D&aacute;il for almost two years, I have been asking for this structure over that time and it still has not happened.  I want the Minister of State to tell the hospitals that this is the structure that must be implemented.  Not only will beds be released by 11 a.m., front-line staff who have to prepare those beds for the next patients will be given a chance to return beds to the ward by 1 p.m. and nurses will then know that they can manage their hospital.  That is a structure.  If that structure was introduced, it would take the stress and anxiety away from nurses and healthcare workers trying to make sure that people are in beds.  It would also relieve the trolley crisis.<\/p>  <p>  I have seen people waiting in hospitals for two days to see a consultant.  When they came out, after meeting a consultant, they got huge bills from their insurance companies, which they had to sign if they did not sign them in the hospitals.  They refused to sign until they saw the huge costs in those bills for waiting and taking up a bed from a person who could have been terminally ill, or very sick, and waiting to get into hospital.  That person was left on a trolley downstairs while the insured person waited for a consultant to see them in the public system.  I want the help of the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government with this.<\/p>  <p>  I support what is being done in this Bill.  When supports are being put in, I support them.  At this stage, the issue is bigger than this Bill.  It is about the waste of money, waste of people's time and waste of bed units.  We can help people, front-line staff and hospitals with a structure, but not until we get the CEOs and management structure right and audited.  If a person is in a job and is not doing it properly, he or she should be removed.  Let us put in somebody who can manage the structure.  I will do whatever I can to help implement this, but I want a commitment from the Government that it will honestly look at it.  I see this issue as the biggest reason our nurses are leaving some of our public hospitals.  I have checked other public hospitals where nurses are not leaving.  It is because a structure is in place whereby they can do their job, and help and care for people, without the stress of trying to manage and run a hospital with no structure.<\/p>  <p>  I ask for the Minister of State's help to help me get the right people in place, including the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to audit the CEOs of the hospitals.  I said that I am disappointed that I have to stand in the Chamber as a Limerick Deputy and say that University Hospital Limerick has one of the highest waiting times in the country, which has been the case for a number of years.  Covid is not causing this situation.  Every other public hospital has the same issues with Covid.  University Hospital Limerick has a management and structural problem.  I ask every Deputy and Minister to help put a structure in place and audit the management of our public hospitals.<\/p>  <p>  If any public hospital has gone above and beyond and has an excellent structure, let us introduce that into Limerick and fix the problem there.  That is what I am asking for.  Let us stop people coming to the Chamber to complain about the front-line service.  It is not the front line; it is the structure.

This can be best understood by comparing the first recorded plan for Brandon in November 2003 with the final available plan twelve years later in January 2015.<br \/><br \/>&quot;All staff need to be aware that Brandon has a history of inappropriate behaviour.. Brandon needs to be supervised at all times by staff...

Brandon should not visit other houses... Brandon should not have access to newspapers, magazines and photographs during the day... Brandon is to be supervised when watching TV&quot; (Proactive strategy, January 2015).<br \/><br \/>In a risk assessment and management plan dated 31st August 2004 the guidance for staff was that they should familiarise themselves with the Health Boards policy &quot;Prevention of Challenging Behaviour&quot; as a means by which to manage Brandon's sexual assaults on other more vulnerable service users.  However, there was no evidence that staff were provided with training, at that time, in the implementation of this policy.<br \/><br \/>Management strategies for Brandon's behaviours<br \/><br \/>A common management strategy employed to deal with Brandon's sexually assaultive behaviour was to move him around various wards.  Brandon was moved a total of nine times in the fifteen year period of this review.  The movement of Brandon from ward to ward began on 12th July 2005 when a decision was taken to move him from 'Breaffy to 'Abbeyside' because <i>&quot;Abbeyside would be a safer environment due to (the) level of supervision and male staff available&quot;<\/i>.  Brandon was moved to 'Abbeyside' that day, however, due to his level of distress and the fact he wanted to go back to 'Breaffy', he was moved back again that night.  Four days later on 16th July 2005 Brandon was then transferred to 'Castledaly'; <i>&quot;transfer to Castledaly due to his nursing care needs - hoist&quot;.<\/i><br \/><br \/>On 3rd January 2006 it is recorded that <i>'Brandon needed an urgent transfer from 'Castledaly' ward'<\/i>as he was causing major upset to clients, he was subsequently moved from 'Castledaly' back to 'Breaffy' on 2nd February 2006.  On 14th June 2007 he was transferred from 'Breaffy' to 'Abbeyside', due to his <i>'increased aggression towards others.  Brandon very difficult to manage...Brandon require(s) male staff 24 hours...Brandon transferred to &quot;Abbeyside&quot; today'<\/i>.<br \/><br \/>By December 2008 he was transferred to House 1, in the Stillwater complex.  While each of these moves provided some respite to the staff and residents of the ward Brandon was vacating, unfortunately they also gave him access to other residents many of whom became new victims of his abusive behaviour.<br \/><br \/>At a staff meeting on 4th May 2011, it was also confirmed that a particularly vulnerable resident targeted by Brandon (resident 1) who had no speech and was unable to call out for help had been moved to a different house for his own safety.  The decision to move this resident was subsequently reversed five weeks later in a review meeting held on the 9th June 2011 which stated <i>&quot;Resident 1 to return to house 1 in Stillwater because a management plan is in place regarding Brandon's behaviour.  The physical environment had been made secure.  Alarm applied to bedroom door&quot;<\/i>.  The decision to return resident 1 to this unit with Brandon after he had moved for his own safety is very concerning.  The review panel believe the assumption the bedroom alarm on Brandon's door would ensure this vulnerable resident's safety is erroneous, as the alarm on Brandon's door had been in place since 30th June 2008 with limited success.  In a staff meeting one week later on 15th June 2011 it is recorded: <i>&quot;(it was) acknowledged that Brandon has the capability of opening and closing the door to sound the alarm in an effort to dupe staff&quot;<\/i>suggesting that Brandon had figured out how to beat the alarm.<br \/><br \/>Six Month's later on the 22nd December 2011 Brandon was moved to house 2, in the Stillwater complex to live by himself, away from other vulnerable residents.  While this move resulted in a sharp reduction in the number of sexual assaults recorded, unfortunately, on 4th September 2013 he was again moved back again to house 1 to live with residents he had previously assaulted.<br \/><br \/>Brandon's move to house 2 appears to have been the only successful strategy employed in the management of Brandon in that it did provide some protection, albeit short term, to other residents.  The reason for Brandon's move back to house 1 was recorded in a &quot;Protection of Vulnerable Adults Strategy Meeting&quot;, 19th September 2013.<br \/><br \/><i>&quot;...on the 15th August 2013 Brandon became unwell and following this was unable to weight bear and as a result required additional staff to manage his care needs so he was transferred to House 1... It was agreed that due to Brandon's recent deterioration in his health he was no longer able to participate in inappropriate sexual behaviour&quot;.<\/i><br \/><br \/>The assessment that Brandon was no longer a risk to others turned out to be inaccurate.  According to a document referred to as a &quot;Primary Risk Screening Form&quot; dated 9th September 2015 (two years later) the risks of physical and sexual harm to others from Brandon continue to be identified...<br \/><br \/>A risk rating scored '25' is the highest risk rating score that can be applied to risks as per the HSE's 'Integrated Risk Management Policy' (2011).  On 9th May 2016 Brandon transferred to a nursing home.  The nursing home has documented that the reason for Brandon's admission to them is: <i>&quot;Nursing Home) received a request to assess Brandon for long term nursing care in April 2016 from (Stillwater) services.  Disclosure was given on an alleged pattern of sexually abusive behaviour and that the transfer was essential because the alleged victim was still resident in the same accommodation as Brandon&quot;.<\/i><br \/><br \/>This extract from the nursing home documentation demonstrates that management in the HSE believed Brandon continued to be a risk to other residents in Stillwater and that his abusive behaviour was continuing.<br \/><br \/>This view is shared by the CHO's Safeguarding and Protection Team's (SPT's) principal social worker who, on 31st October 2017, spoke to the CHO's Chief Officer and said:<br \/><br \/><i>&quot;Brandon poses a risk to other vulnerable adults of sexual abuse.  Responses to date are that the risk Brandon poses are minimised due to his now limited mobility, however, I do not agree that this is an accurate reflection of the risk as Brandon's behaviours were primarily centred on exposing himself to peers and exposing peers to sexually inappropriate behaviours... Clearly, limited mobility does not minimise the risk of this to an extent whereby other vulnerable adults are protected&quot;<\/i>...<br \/><br \/><i>&quot;The staff at the current environment within the resources available try to limit these incidents which are on-going.  If the move to the new house happens now this could reduce the number of these assaults for the most vulnerable group and improve the quality of life for all concerned&quot;.<\/i><br \/><br \/>On two occasions psychiatrist (1) also sought a second opinion from other external psychiatrists.  The first external opinion was from psychiatrist (2) who reviewed Brandon on 19th March 2008.  Psychiatrist (2) brief note states:<br \/><br \/><i>&quot;Very difficult management problem...sexualisation probably due to underlying affective disorder...no quality of life due to mental state&quot;.<\/i><br \/><br \/>In April 2011 a second external review was sought from a psychiatrist (3) who completed an assessment of Brandon on 12th April 2011.  Psychiatrist (3) submitted her report to psychiatrist (1) and service manager (1) on 27th April 2011.  This five-page report provides a concise synopsis of what psychiatrist (3) describes as Brandon's <i>&quot;seriously abnormal sexual behaviour&quot;<\/i>.  The report outlines two particular problems: <i>&quot;excessive masturbation&quot;<\/i>and <i>&quot;contact sexual behaviour&quot;<\/i>.  The psychiatrist (3) described the residents living with Brandon as <i>&quot;very vulnerable to the sexual threat of opportunistic, predatory and recidivistic approach of this man&quot;<\/i>.  Psychiatrist (3) report went on to make a number of recommendations including:  \t<i>- &quot;It is totally inappropriate to allow this man to continue to live with and sexually exploit vulnerable learning disabled men...<\/i><br \/><br \/><i>-The fact that relatives of his known victims have not been informed of the episodes of abuse could be interpreted as collusion or complicity if the situation were ever the subject of an investigation...&quot;.<\/i>On 4th May 2011 at a staff meeting the issues referred to in the psychiatrist (3) report were discussed and it was concluded that <i>&quot;the residents of house 1 are at risk of sexual advance from Brandon at any time&quot;<\/i>...<br \/><br \/>Reports to external managers.<br \/><br \/>...The first reference of concerns about Brandon being escalated to senior management was in a letter by psychiatrist (1) to his GP dated 7th February 2008 which stated; <i>'I will be speaking with senior nursing staff in relation to the management of Brandon's behaviour.  I will be raising the issues in managing this type of individual within current resources with the local health manager'<\/i>. <\/blockquote> ","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700038#LL00400","speaker":"1547","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":335,"content":"<p>I rarely interrupt Members, but it is some stretch of the imagination to relate that case to the subject matter of the business-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":336,"content":"<p>We are discussing a health Bill and I listened to other Members who did not strictly adhere to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I ask the Deputy to connect the subject matter-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":338,"content":"<p>I will connect it up at the end.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00500","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":339,"content":"<p>We are getting there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I was working towards that-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00700","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":341,"content":"<p>Go on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700039#MM00800","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1638905400,"counter":342,"content":"<p>-----because it is vitally important.<\/p> <blockquote> \tOn 6th July 2008, psychiatrist (1) subsequently wrote to the local health manager in the area referencing the<i>'relocation of residents from Abbeyside...to the 'Stillwater complex'<\/i>and urging the relocation to take place sooner rather than later.

This letter is a significant milestone in the overall account of Brandon's assaults on others and demonstrates the deep level of concern that these six staff members had about vulnerable individuals in their care.

I commend the firefighters and ambulance paramedics of Dublin Fire Brigade, who have a long and proud tradition of keeping our community safe, especially during the pandemic.  When most people were being told to stay home and stay safe, front-line workers like the members of the Dublin Fire Brigade donned their gear, left their families and went to work.<\/p><p>I will outline what the Government and Dublin Fire Brigade management need to do to support our firefighters and ambulance staff.  They need to initiate two back-to-back recruitment training classes to be scheduled immediately to exhaust the current training panel and alleviate the situation in a timely manner; immediately establish a new panel to allow for further recruitment classes to be trained; support every effort made by both sides to reach an agreement on overall Dublin Fire Brigade operational manning levels and other outstanding issues currently being negotiated; ensure all firefighters and officers are fully trained in managing high-rise fire and medical emergencies; schedule a full training programme to ensure full competencies across all watches and stations, including retained stations; fully implement the recommendations of the fire safety task force group report published by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage in July 2018; and recognise the propensity of staff to suffer from burnout if repeatedly working overtime to cover staff shortages, provide information to staff regarding the tall-tale signs of burnout and support for staff who may be suffering from burnout.  I will return later to the issue of resources and a strategic plan for the future growth of Dublin Fire Brigade in an ever-growing Dublin, in terms of both population and business.<\/p><p>At the start of this pandemic, firefighters and paramedics in the Dublin Fire Brigade did not know what was ahead of them.  That did not matter as they had a job to do which involved saving lives, supporting our communities and keeping them safe.  Over recent weeks, I have met with trade union representatives, firefighters, the chief fire officer and staff in Dublin City Council.  The firefighters talked about how they are demoralised.  They were working excessively long hours covering shifts and are fearful for their own and others' safety if the situation of staff shortages continues.<\/p><p>Here are the hard numbers.  All agree the current number of firefighters is 965.  However, there are currently 35 vacancies, 35 on bereavement leave and 30 on special projects.  All accept these are important projects but it adds to the problem of staff shortages.  I acknowledge 35 new recruits are to come in December or January with a new class of 45 to start in February.  However, these 45 recruits will not be added to the roster until at least the end of 2022 as it takes a minimum of ten months to train a firefighter.<\/p><p>Today a firefighter informed me that the Dublin Fire Brigade factor in 30 to 35 retirements each year and a firefighter told me yesterday at a meeting that it is like filling a bucket but the holes are getter bigger each year.  He said what is happening at the moment is not even enough to cover people who are leaving through retirement.  It is clear that what is being done to relieve the pressure on workers will not solve the problem in the coming years and staff are at risk of burnout, which will impact their health and safety, along with that of our citizens.  This must be seen as an urgent matter for the Government.<\/p><p>As I said, I will return later to the resources, the expansion of Dublin city and county and the strategic plan for Dublin Fire Brigade as Dublin grows.  The Minister has heard the statistics we have been given by the trade unions and the chief fire officer, who admitted they are not sufficient for the current numbers, let alone for a growing Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700040#NN00400","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"speech","time":1638906000,"counter":347,"content":"<p>Eighty years ago in May 1941, Dublin Fire Brigade crews were hailed as heroes across the nation for their quick response in rushing headlong to Belfast to help their colleagues and the citizens there to tackle the fires and destruction from a night-long Luftwaffe bombardment of the city.

There are many other reasons for them and us to be proud of Dublin Fire Brigade.<\/p>  <p>  Like all other front-line services, they did not have to be asked twice to step up when this pandemic hit our shores.  As the emergency ambulance services for the greater Dublin area, the men and women of Dublin Fire Brigade have been run off their feet trying to cope with Covid calls on top of their ordinary, or extraordinary, work day-in, day-out.  Despite being often hamstrung by huge staff shortages, they have got the job done but they are at breaking point.  They are emulating the firefighting heroes of the past daily and the least we can do is ensure they have a full complement of staff to carry out their duties and the equipment to do their jobs, nothing more or less.  Dublin Fire Brigade does not have the pull to deal with the large staff shortages which are beginning to cripple the service.  It needs to do much more to deliver for Dublin in terms of fire, rescue and ambulance services.

That is the experience of thousands of Dubliners.  The Minister knows this and is proud of the Dublin Fire Brigade, as I am.  It is an important service, not just for who its members are and what they do, but for what they represent to the people of Dublin.  It is a highly trained service.

It is great to see so many young people across north County Dublin but we need a fire service that is fit for today and future-proofed to take account of the growing population and the growing number of housing developments.

Its members do not want to be in the business of talking to politicians or union officials; they want to get on with doing the work for which they are highly trained and competent and well capable of doing.  When they have to ballot for industrial action, step out of their comfort zone and their area of work and into industrial relations and health and safety legislation, that should set off alarm bells in the Minister's office and across the city and county.

Like others, and as all Deputies who contribute to the debate this evening probably will do, I pay tribute to the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade, our firefighters, ambulance staff and paramedics.  I do not think there is a Member of this House who, either directly from family experience or as a constituency politician, has not had interaction with the fire service at the front line of its work.  This is not a normal job.  It is not a job you start at 9 a.m and from which you can go home at 5 p.m.  It is a vocation.  The men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade bring to that job an enormous level of commitment.  That is shown very clearly in the fact that day in, day out they put their own lives at risk.  That is not only a tribute to them, but to their families and their wider communities.<\/p>  <p>  When I look at successive Governments, I find that often it is those public servants at the very coalface of some of the most difficult jobs who are resourced the poorest.  Sometimes, that is carers and other times it is nurses or members of the Defence Forces.  That the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade felt the need to ballot for industrial action is itself a failure.  Everybody here knows what is required.  Everybody here knows what we need to do.  It would be really powerful if, coming out of this debate, we had unanimity and an acceptance that there are issues here in terms of resourcing, staff, training and support that need to be resolved and that, with collective political will, clear intent and signalling from Government, we can ensure are resolved in the best interests of the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade and the men, women and children of the city in Dublin.<\/p>  <p>  Like the Minister and Deputy O'Reilly, I represent a constituency that is growing very rapidly, namely, Adamstown, which the Minister visited recently, and the significant residential development at Clonburris will commence soon.  Therefore, not only do we need to meet the current staff complement, in respect of which there is a shortfall, we need to go further than that.  I genuinely look forward to the Minister's response.

It operates 12 full-time stations, inclusive of the station at the Belgard Road in Tallaght.  This work is being done even though the service is almost 100 firefighters short of what is required to adequately and safely man our fire stations.  It is an almost daily occurrence that vehicles are unavailable for deployment owing to insufficient firefighters to staff them.  Staff are constantly battling exhaustion owing to, we are told, repeated requests to work overtime and to cover staff shortages.  Simply put, our fire service is at crisis point.<\/p>  <p>  This is not a new issue.  Dublin Fire Brigade has been highlighting severe understaffing for years, which has worsened in the face of inaction by senior management.  Tallaght fire station is the centre for responses to major incidents in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  My fear is that it does not have the personnel or the necessary equipment to respond to such emergencies.  The Minister might address that in his response.  <\/p>  <p>  The lack of planning is evidenced elsewhere in that there are only 36 trainees to graduate this January, which is not nearly enough to fill the existing vacancies in the service.  More firefighters will retire next year.  If this continues, more gaps will open up and responders will be spread even more thinly.  The joint Dublin fire and ambulance medical response model that currently operates and delivers fully trained medical responders is, I am told, also under threat and needs to be supported, not changed.  The failure of the Government to ensure that Dublin Fire Brigade has the personnel and equipment it needs is also leaving the public vulnerable.  It is essential that Dublin City Council chief executive officer, Owen Keegan, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, meet directly with the firefighters and their unions to address these funding and staffing issues.  Staff shortages directly affect the emergency response times of Dublin Fire Brigade and must be immediately addressed because understaffing or delayed response times put the public at serious risk.<\/p>  <p>  In my area of Tallaght, there was a fire recently in an apartment block.  That incident showed the skills and ability of the ambulance and fire brigade services, but it also served as a warning in regard to resourcing and staffing of our fire services.  On that evening, at the height of the response, there were eight fire brigades on the scene, which is the majority of Dublin Fire Brigade's strength.  Had a second major incident occurred simultaneously, it would have stretched Dublin Fire Brigade's response capability to the brink.  We know that the turntable ladder is located in the city and of the concern that raises in terms of delays, etc.  A major incident on the M50 and, at the same time, a fire on the north side would put the fire services in the impossible position of having to divide resources with lives in balance.  In a city of well over 1 million inhabitants, we need a fire service that has the capability to respond to more than one major incident at any one time.  The current situation whereby on-call vehicles are leaving stations with less than a full complement of firefighters is putting the crews and public at risk.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700041#OO00300","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1638906600,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, for bringing forward this motion to the D&aacute;il.

As a Dub and like many Dubliners, I am extremely proud of the invaluable fire rescue and ambulance service provided by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  The work that is undertaken by the men and women of the brigade, as other speakers have recognised, can be dangerous, physically and mentally demanding and very challenging.  It takes a particular kind of brave and dedicated person to take on the role.  The Dublin Fire Brigade members and their colleagues in the emergency services throughout the State save lives, first and foremost, and also prevent damage to residential and commercial property.  I particularly want to recognise the very difficult circumstances in which our crews have worked through the 22 months of the pandemic.  It has been a very challenging time and continues to be so.<\/p>  <p>  I am sure Deputy Donnelly is aware of the following points but I want to raise them for the record of the House.  Under the Fire Services Act, it is the statutory function of the fire authorities to provide a fire service in a particular functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, assessment of fire cover and provision of fire station premises.  My role in the Department, which I am very serious about, is to support the fire authorities through setting general policy and national standards, providing a central training programme, which I will turn to presently, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and, very importantly, providing capital funding, of which we recently allocated &euro;61 million over the next five years, for equipment, appliances and priority infrastructural projects to meet the needs of a growing population.<\/p>  <p>  I will now deal with some of the issues that are raised in the motion.  The Covid pandemic has presented challenges to the Dublin Fire Brigade in respect of recruitment and training of new staff, which has resulted in particular staff shortages at this time.  There is no question about that.  However, my Department, as instructed by me, together with Dublin City Council, is actively engaging to address this issue and see how we can expedite the recruitment programme.  Covid has presented a difficulty in terms of the length of time training is taking.  It bears repeating, however, that, despite the pandemic, recruitment and training is ongoing in the O'Brien Institute in Marino and other training centres.  As I travel around the country, I make it my business to visit fire crews and paramedics, whether in North Strand or Swords, Ballybay or Ennis.  This motion is timely in that it recognises the work they do.<\/p>  <p>  The most recent firefighter recruitment campaign began in September 2019, as Deputies know, and the first class of recruits began training in April 2020.  It is detailed and tough training and there is a time constraint in that regard.  The second recruitment class started in June 2021 and will finish in December, with 36 recruits taking up positions.  Deputy Donnelly may not be aware that a third recruitment class of 45 will begin training in early 2022, with provision within the Dublin City Council budget for a fourth class of the remaining panelled recruits later in 2022.  We need to make up the gap the Deputy spoke about, and that is planned for and is happening.  Funding was mentioned in the context of delivering overall additional staff positions.  To be clear, the issue of staff shortages is not just a funding one.  Firefighters and paramedics are not just hired; there is an extensive recruitment and training process.  I encourage everyone, with the permission of the Dublin Fire Brigade, to visit the training centres and see the extensive training undertaken by recruits.  That training takes time and the fire brigade management must follow a process.<\/p>  <p>  It should be clearly understood that there a number of issues at play at this time in respect of the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Dublin City Council, as the employer, has been engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies, including both F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU, at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  There has been some progress in a number of areas.  I am very glad of that and I continue to watch the matter very closely.  There is not a week that goes by when I am not in contact with someone in the fire brigade, its management or somebody in Dublin City Council.  Some of that progress would alleviate the pressures caused by current staffing arrangements but no final agreement has yet been reached.  In an attempt to break the impasse, a proposal was made on 17 November and a response is awaited.  The most important thing at this point is to get all parties to re-engage with the established statutory industrial machinery in order to achieve a resolution without delay.  I believe such a resolution is achievable.  I will deal presently with issues relating to the Department of Health.  I take this opportunity strongly to urge all parties to re-enter that process in good faith.  I am confident the remaining issues are capable of being resolved.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and I continue to work with the Dublin Fire Brigade on issues and to provide support.  Last week, during the normal course of my duties and in advance of this motion being tabled, I met the Minister for Health in an attempt to make progress around the provision of ambulance services by the Dublin Fire Brigade on behalf of the National Ambulance Service, NAS.  A long-standing issue that is nearly resolved is the use of one combined system but involving separate locations.  The Duffy report provides the way for this to be resolved, as I reiterated at the meeting last week.  I am of the firm belief that an equitable solution can be met.  I am an unequivocal supporter of the Dublin Fire Brigade retaining its emergency services role.  I want to be really clear about that.  There are synergies and our crews in the NAS also do incredible work.  We want to make sure the call and dispatch system is uniform.<\/p>  <p>  In the short time remaining, I want to respond to the further points that were raised.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will wrap up the debate and give the final response from the Government.  We are not opposing the motion.  A significant portion of it is very similar to the motion I brought forward in the previous Oireachtas, which was supported by all parties.  We want to move this forward.<\/p>  <p>  For the two minutes that are left to me, I will talk briefly about funding.  Local authorities across the country have a yearly budget of approximately &euro;240 million to run fire services.  That budget is supplemented by my Department's fire services capital programme, which provides for investment in appliances, vehicles, equipment, upgrading of existing stations and construction of new stations.  In December 2020, I announced a new fire services capital programme for the period from then until 2025, with an allocation of &euro;61 million.  Following extensive engagements with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works appliances were received, evaluated and prioritised.  Nationally, the new programme will see six new fire stations built and continued support for the further construction of an additional 12, nine fire station refurbishments and 35 new fire engines.<\/p>  <p>  In Dublin specifically, as part of the 2020 fire services capital plan, Dublin Fire Brigade will receive six new class B appliances.  It should be noted that these appliances are not bought off the shelf.  They are constructed on order, which involves a lead time.  I am pleased to say that Dublin Fire Brigade took delivery of two new class B appliances very recently and is finalising local upskilling in order that the tenders can be in service before Christmas.  Two additional new appliances are due for delivery early in the new year.  In addition, a new turntable ladder is due to be delivered in January and an additional turntable ladder has been sanctioned by my Department.  As part of the 2020 five-year capital services plan - this is really important as we see the region expanding - we are looking at where new stations need to be located and where the capacity of existing stations needs to be increased to deal with the rise in population.<\/p> <p> I am heavily invested in the issues relating to Dublin Fire Brigade and I want them to be resolved.  The motion is useful and helpful.  By engagement through the existing machinery and by placing a real focus on this matter, we can bring some of the outstanding issues to resolution.  I want to be clear - and I am sure the House speaks as one on this - that we firmly support the provision of emergency services in Dublin by Dublin Fire Brigade and their colleagues in other front-line services such as the National Ambulance Service.  We want to make sure that continues and that the services are funded into the future.  We can bridge the recruitment gap that has been impacted by Covid.  Those with a fair view from the outside looking in will understand that the pandemic has been an issue in the context of how we can bring in new recruits.  We will be expediting two further recruitment classes.<\/p> <p> As I said, I am not able to respond to the motion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will reply to the debate towards the end.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700042#PP00200","speaker":"1561","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638907800,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I am struck by a memory of when I was very small in school.  We visited a fire station and were told that the most important thing you could do in a fire was to get out and stay out.  The people of whom we are speaking here this evening actually run into burning buildings.  Their job is to protect us and to rescue us.  We rely on them when we are at our most vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  Dublin firefighters have given notice of their intention to ballot for industrial action over staff shortages because their safety and that of their colleagues and the members of the public they serve has been compromised by the failure to deal with issues and concerns raised.  The service is currently operating below agreed safe staffing levels and there is an over-reliance on overtime to reach daily staffing levels.  I know from speaking regularly with the fire service in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath that Dublin Fire Brigade is not alone.  Panels cannot be filled, let alone posts.  People are leaving.  Some are actually leaving the country.  These retained firefighters talk not only of the stressful nature of the job that they do, which they signed up to do, which they love and which they want to do, they also speak about the negative impact that it has on their families, their children, their partners and their spouses.  They speak of their inability to take holidays or to give a commitment to just simply be there as part of the because of that same over-reliance on overtime.  However, they do it.  They do it willingly to support each other because that is the nature of the job.<\/p>  <p>  Firefighters and communities deserve much better than the massaging of figures and statistics.  What I hear from firefighters is that they do not feel supported.  They feel that their role is not being valued and that overtime, the service and they themselves are purposely being downgraded because there is an increase in reliance on voluntary responders and a lack of appropriate training.  They simply do not feel like they are being listened to or that their concerns are being addressed.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that many employed in our fire services are not given the tools, the support or the proper working conditions required to perform their duties is farcical.   Dublin firefighters are considering strike action to improve the safety of the service.  Others may well follow suit.  Our firefighters across the country, both retained and full-time, are willing to do this vital work.  Is the Minister willing to properly resource them to do it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700043#QQ00500","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1638907800,"counter":360,"content":"<p>I also thank Deputy Paul Donnelly for bringing forward this motion.  Dublin Fire Brigade provides an invaluable full-time fire rescue and ambulance service for the greater Dublin area.  It is a model that should be replicated throughout the country.  It is clear that while the retained model that is prevalent in rural Ireland is doing its best thanks to part-time retained firefighters, the system is not suitable for the 21st century.  We need an all-Ireland national fire service that is free from the budget constraints of local authorities, where it competes with roads and playgrounds for the meagre resources provided out of county councils' income.  Economies of scale and the sharing of expertise will help to modernise our fire service.  If the issues of recruitment and retention are not addressed, firefighters or members of the public may be seriously injured or even die.  This simply cannot be allowed to occur.<\/p>  <p>  Firefighters put their lives on the line every time they answer a call.  In 2007, firefighters Brian Murray and Mark O&rsquo;Shaughnessy from Bray and Michael Liston from Foynes, County Limerick, gave their lives in the line of duty.  I would like to remember them and all those who have served in our fire service who are no longer with us.  The Government must provide funding to employ additional fire service staff by offering positions to all those currently on the recruitment panel for the greater Dublin area and to plan for further expansion in the years ahead.  The Government must make it easier for firefighters transfer between local authorities without loss of pay grade and pension entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister heard Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe speak about Kildare.  I know several firefighters who live in Kildare and who commute outside the county to full-time positions.  Some of them are obliged to travel more than 100 miles each way.  They would gladly work in Dublin were it not for the lack of ability to transfer, as well as the loss of pay and entitlements.  They should be as successful at interview as any raw recruit.  I would imagine that there are many more who live much closer to Dublin.  I feel urgent action is needed before the situation gets any worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700043#QQ00600","speaker":"1588"},{"type":"speech","time":1638907800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I welcome this motion on Dublin Fire Brigade.  I also wish to commend my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly, on bringing it forward.<\/p>  <p>  My constituency of Dublin North-West has a large and growing population.  It is served by Finglas fire station, which is known as No. 5 station within Dublin Fire Brigade.  I cannot but give the highest of praise to all those who serve in Finglas and in the fire services throughout Dublin.  I would like to take the opportunity now to thank them for their courage and dedication serving communities in Dublin North-West and across the city.  These men and women of the fire service place themselves in danger every day in order to keep us safe and to safeguard our properties.  The very least we can do is make sure that they have all the resources they require to do their job and keep them safe.  However, in recent months members of the fire service have increasingly raised their concerns over staff shortages, particularly during the run up to Hallowe&rsquo;en, which is traditionally one of the fire service&rsquo;s busiest times of the year.  It is clear that the fire service is understaffed.  Union representatives for the fire services have said that a recruitment drive is urgently needed to offset the critical shortage in staffing.<\/p>  <p>  A number of months ago, a spokesman for the fire service union SIPTU spoke of his understanding that as many as up to four fire trucks were not in service due to a shortage in the staff numbers needed to operate them.  This disturbing situation puts lives and property and risk.  Measures should be put in place to ensure that this never happens again.  The very least that can be done immediately would be an increase in the minimum number of firefighters.  There should also be a recruitment drive that will take into account the number of vacancies left by retirement from the service.  A great number of members of the service are retiring this year because many of them were obliged to delay their retirement due to Covid-19.   While the fire service is under-resourced and understaffed, all our lives and the lives of the members of the staff of the service are put at risk.  It is welcomed that the Government is not opposing this motion, but actions speak louder than words.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700043#QQ00700","speaker":"1470"},{"type":"speech","time":1638907800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Paul Donnelly.  The Deputy and I often have a little bit of banter about the northside and the southside of Dublin, which the Minister will know about from being a Dub.  There are some things that unite us, such as the likes of the Dublin GAA team and the value that we place on Dublin Fire Brigade.  I sat in on Leaders' Questions this morning and I heard the Taoiseach commend the front-line workers that will be called upon throughout the day and tonight during Storm Barra.  One of the services that will be called first tonight will be Dublin Fire Brigade.  I want to thank the members of the brigade for the service that they give us and I want to wish them well in their endeavours on behalf of all of us tonight.<\/p>  <p>  We expect the fire brigade to come to our aid when things are difficult and sometimes in life-threatening situations to make things safer for us all.  At the moment, Dublin Fire Brigade staff do not get the same consideration in the workplace.  In fact, SIPTU has written to the chief fire officer calling for a safe system of work to be provided for all of its members.  It has given a notice, although I do not think it is very likely, of intention to ballot fire fighters in two weeks&rsquo; time in respect of industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency of Dublin Mid-West, the Adamstown fire station was promised nearly 20 years ago.  It has still not materialised.  As the Minister indicated, there are areas of high population growth that need to be looked after, such as the places like Adamstown and the Clonburris strategic development zone.<\/p> <p> There have been serious concerns regarding staffing levels, which my colleagues have mentioned, and there have been times when appliances and fire brigades were taken off the road.  Five fire trucks were taken off the road at Hallowe'en, which is the busiest time of year for firefighters.  Our fire services perform an invaluable service, saving lives and protecting our communities and we know just how important the fire brigade is to our communities.  Due to the Government's failure to invest, the service is understaffed and workers feel exhausted and unsafe.  Our communities deserve better.  Our motion will support communities and services by ensuring a fully resourced Dublin Fire Brigade.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Minister's support for the motion.  I also welcome the initial recruitment drive that he mentioned.  We are all on the same page here.  We all want a fully resourced fire brigade that is able to call out where and when needed.

I do not think anyone could grow up in Dublin, particularly on the northside, without the issue of Stardust looming large whenever the fire brigade or firefighters are mentioned.  It is a scar across the northside.  It happened 40 years ago but it is something that runs extremely deep.  That is why, when we had a presentation from SIPTU and firefighters a number of weeks ago about this matter, I could almost see myself sitting in an Oireachtas committee after some disaster in the future listening to testimony about how we were completely unprepared.  Having visited Kilbarrack fire station in my constituency and having listened to firefighters there saying they have no capacity to deal with any fire that takes place over the sixth storey in any apartment block, it is clear that these people are putting their lives on the line for something they believe in, which is protecting life and public safety, but they are not given the tools to do the job properly.  It takes a huge amount for somebody to ballot for industrial action.  It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do.  I sometimes wonder if people who do not understand the trade union movement or the labour movement think balloting for industrial action is a frivolous thing that people do without thinking.  It is the biggest thing a worker can ever do.  There is no selfish motive behind this.  It is not about pay or conditions.  This is about the potential for the service to actually do its job.<\/p>  <p>  We were all told to stay home today.  Schoolchildren were told not to go to school.  Childcare facilities and third level institutions were closed and will still be closed in many areas around the country tomorrow but our firefighter personnel are still expected to go out and effectively put their lives on the line to protect us.  They put on that uniform and believe in it but the feeling from them is that the State, or the authorities in Dublin who oversee the fire brigade, do not believe in that uniform as much as they do.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate that this motion is not being opposed.  That is a positive move and much of what the Minister said is to be commended.  However, I was absolutely shook by the testimony given to me and others when Senator Marie Sherlock organised that briefing for us.  I felt that we were potentially looking at a situation like what happened in the UK when a major fire incident took place.  Lives were lost and destroyed, bodies were maimed, children's lives were torn apart and children's parents were lost.   We we were told at that briefing that the capacity of Dublin Fire Brigade to deal with such a major event is being undermined by lack of personnel, staff shortages and lack of basic equipment, as I have outlined.<\/p>  <p>  In my constituency, there are massive Celtic tiger constructions that have been built over the past 20 or so years.  With the changing face of Dublin, the way people live now is very different to the way they lived at the time of the Stardust fire.  They live in apartment complexes and the major complaint people have about apartment defects is always around fire safety.  If we were to face a major fire in one of these complexes, which have question marks as regards fire safety, and if we had a catastrophe of the nature of what has happened in the UK in more recent years, we would be looking at each other at an Oireachtas committee saying that we were told and asking what we did about it.  We are still about 100 people short of what is needed to properly service the fire hazard needs of this city.  It is not just what these people do as regards fire but it is also to do with rescue, cardiac arrests and various other things that firefighters and people in Dublin Fire Brigade are trained to deal with.<\/p>  <p>  I know from the Minister's response that he is across this issue but all of us in politics are always fearful of the day when we are sitting in a committee meeting knowing that we have been told, that it was outlined to us and that we did not do enough when told to prevent it.  We are all very wise after an event.  Whenever anything happens in politics, or some major catastrophe, event or occasion, everybody is wise after the event.  Everybody can tell you exactly what should have happened but we are being told about this now.  For Dublin Fire Brigade to ballot for industrial action is a huge move from those members.  It is nothing to do with pay or conditions.  It is all to do with the service in which they are proud to serve and the uniform they put on.  I can only imagine how a family member of a firefighter feels every time they leave home in order to go to work because I am quite sure there is a percentage of their brain that worries about them coming back through that door again.  Other jobs are just not like that.  Every fire station has a dedication to somebody whose life was lost or changed as a result of the work they do.  If they are telling us, unselfishly, that they need more people to do their jobs and protect the city then they absolutely must be listened to.  If they are saying to people like me that they do not have any capacity to deal with a fire over the sixth storey of an apartment block, they have to be listened to.  These are the front-line heroes we keep hearing about.  We cannot keep congratulating people for the work they do day to day, as well as on days like today, then not listen to what they have to say and force them to go down the route of industrial action.  It is a shameful day when firefighters, fire personnel and Dublin Fire Brigade have to ballot for industrial action.<\/p>  <p>  For people in my constituency, every northside Dubliner, and probably every Dubliner and most people in this country, when they hear the word \"Stardust\" they know exactly what that means.  It was 40 years ago but all of us have been shaped by that event.  None of us want to be in a situation - and I am repeating the point - of saying in a number of years after an event that we were told and did not do enough.  These people are telling us now, in an unselfish fashion, using the most powerful method they have by potentially withdrawing their labour and going through and industrial action process, about the deficiencies in the service.  We have to do our bit.  We are all collectively supporting this motion but what we need is a service with 1,040 members, as has been advocated for.  That is the service we need.  We should not just go up to 965, which will happen when the 45 people the Minister said are currently in training are added.  These people deserve better.  We are reminded today of the sacrifices they make every day, and of their families, who I am sure wonder every day if they are going to cross back over the threshold of the home when they come back from work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700044#RR00200","speaker":"1551"},{"type":"speech","time":1638909000,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this timely and worthy motion.  The past two years have forced us to have a greater appreciation of our front-line workers and their dedication and workload, but also the environment in which they work and the resources they are provided.  I have said this many times in the Chamber regarding our nurses, our teachers, our other front-line services and now our Dublin Fire Brigade.  It is not enough to clap our hands in admiration or for those in power to cross their fingers and hope that inadequate resources will not result in disaster.<\/p>  <p>  This is an important and urgent motion.  Perhaps it is fitting that it is being debated today when Storm Barra is causing havoc for the emergency services that are keeping the public safe, including the Dublin Fire Brigade despite its years-long staffing shortage, exhaustion and low morale.  Last night, Dublin Fire Brigade rescued a person who had taken shelter in a tower crane after spotting the person with a thermal imaging camera.  Retirement numbers are adding further strain to the staffing situation.  The balance between retirements and recruitment is out of whack.  Only 36 recruits have joined the Dublin Fire Brigade this year.  The Minister has addressed this issue, so I will change my point.  Yesterday marked the retirement of a firefighter from the service.  I wish Mr. Stephen Dillon the best in his retirement.<\/p>  <p>  While the Dublin Fire Brigade's staffing has been an issue for several years, Covid has exacerbated the situation.  That is a phrase that we often use in the Chamber, but I will provide an example to outline the extent of the problem.  On 22 November, 49 Dublin Fire Brigade staff were unavailable to work due to testing positive, being a close contact or awaiting a test result.  That loss of staff was critical, particularly given that the brigade was already operating at below operational levels.  It also meant that critical fire appliances were off the road due to crews being short-staffed.  This was an issue even before the pandemic.  In July 2019, it was revealed that 23 fire appliances were off the road over the course of seven days.  Crews were short a combined 161 personnel.  This has been a constant issue, with reports of 20% of appliances being out of use most weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Every day, the people we trust in an emergency are going out concerned not only for their ability to work and keep people safe, but for their own safety.  We are plugging the gap with overtime, but that cannot be maintained and is having a detrimental effect on the well-being and health of personnel.  We must listen to the very people who manage risk and assess dangerous situations every day when they tell us that there is a problem.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the call on the Government to ensure that all firefighters and officers are fully trained to manage high-rise fires.  There is not the staffing, training or equipment required to ensure that fires in tall building blocks are dealt with adequately.  There has been little increase in the provision of high-reach fire appliances despite the city having grown considerably and there is a clear disconnect between the strategic housing development scheme granting numerous planning permissions for high-rise apartment blocks and the Dublin Fire Brigade's training.  International best practice is needed when ladders cannot reach.  Our firefighters know the techniques to best manage the fire inside.  Fighting fires in high-rise buildings requires different techniques and training.  It is not something that a firefighter should have to learn in the moment when dealing with an emergency.  This is not something that can be learned on the job.  While new height training modules are available, they are limited to new recruits and newly promoted officers.  We must ensure that this essential training is rolled out to all personnel across the Dublin Fire Brigade.<\/p>  <p>  When looking out at Storm Barra raging, I remembered a presentation that the Dublin Fire Brigade gave to Dublin City Council in October when a similar motion to this one was tabled.  It was mentioned that, because it had rained on Halloween night, the firefighters were relieved.  They thanked the heavens that it was raining because they did not have the personnel to deal with what would normally have been one of their busiest nights of the year.  That firefighters have to look to the sky in order to figure out whether they can do their job is an incredible indictment of the State and something that we need to address.<\/p>  <p>  I remember a presentation from the Dublin Fire Brigade on water safety training and water-based rescues while I was on Dublin City Council.  Dublin Fire Brigade takes more people out of the water than it does out of burning houses now.  It carries out that training either at the end of the Liffey or in Glendalough, which is fed by a spate river.  When it rains as it is at the moment, though, there is too much water and the brigade cannot train.  During the summer months when it does not rain enough, there is too little water and it cannot train either.  We need a Dublin Fire Brigade that is suitable for 21st century rescues, be they in high-rise buildings or on water, and it needs personnel.<\/p>  <p>  For all the Dublin Fire Brigade officers whom I have come into contact with, it is a vocation for them.  They do the job because they believe in it.  It is a sad indictment of the State that they are now considering industrial action.  This is something that we can address, be it in this Chamber or across Dublin's councils, but urgency is required.  There is not much in the way of argument in this Chamber because we all agree that the men and women of the Dublin Fire Brigade are incredible.  They need resources.  What they need from this Chamber is not just words, but urgency.  I hope that the Minister can give them that this evening.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the motion's proposer and the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700045#SS00100","speaker":"1560"},{"type":"speech","time":1638909000,"counter":366,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this good motion, which People Before Profit supports.

To people tracking this, it is clear how, six or nine months ago, the Government decided that it did not want pictures of it voting against stuff that people thought was eminently reasonable and it would instead allow those motions to pass.  It would not vote against them but it would not necessarily implement them either.  I hope that will not be the case in this instance.  Not resourcing the fire brigade properly would be a difficult argument to make.<\/p><p>I was watching the debate and a point was made by a number of Deputies about the broad public support for the fire brigade.  That point is correct and it is right that the brigade has such support.  I warn the Government, though, as that broad public support will carry through into broad public support for industrial action if the firefighters feel that is necessary.  It will not wane.  The public will see that these people, who are putting their lives on the line to protect society day in and day out, feel it is necessary to take industrial action in order to ensure that our fire services are properly resourced and people are safe.  That broad public support will continue.  This should be extra pressure on the Government to follow through on the motion's acceptance.<\/p><p>In the remainder of my time, I will focus on a particular issue that has featured reasonably prominently in this debate, that of high-rise buildings or tall and complex buildings, as firefighters refer to them.  It was reported in August by a firefighter, Mr. John Mahon, in speaking to the <i>Dublin Inquirer<\/i>that the Dublin Fire Brigade did not have the training or equipment it needed to tackle blazes in high-rise buildings.  I understand from speaking to fire brigade personnel that there are two issues, those being, training and equipment, by which I mean aerial appliances.  Consider the development of Dublin as a city.  There is a moderately dense city centre, relatively low-density building as far as the outskirts and, at the outskirts in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Finglas and around the M50 ring, a proliferation of reasonably high-rise developments of six, seven, eight or nine storeys.  That development is accelerating.  In some areas, the strategic housing development process, which is thankfully being closed, has been used to drive that.  This raises a serious issue if high-rise developments are getting approved and we do not have the equipment and training necessary to ensure that those who will live there are safe.<\/p> <p>As I understand it, there is very good training available in Dublin Fire Brigade to deal with tall and complex buildings.  I also understand that aerial appliances, for example, are not the answer all by themselves, because once you go above a certain height, you are not going to get people out via an aerial appliance and you must get them out through the inside of the building.  It is very dangerous and specialised work for which training is required.  The point, as I understand it, is that because of the under-resourcing and understaffing of the fire brigade, people are not able to get the training as there is a need to be able to cover the service on a daily basis.  Covid has had an extra impact in terms of knocking people out, and then there are not enough people left to be able to facilitate enough people to get the training that needs to be done.  We have an under-trained fire service as it stands, although we have people with enormous talents, skills and the capacity to provide the training, but it is not currently happening.<br\/><br\/>The second issue is equipment.  The fire at the Glashaus Hotel and apartments in Tallaght a month and a half ago was mentioned.  The stories that emerged from that were truly terrifying.  People were trapped on their balconies in fear of their lives waiting to be rescued.  The amount of time they were trapped on the balconies was prolonged because of the lack of equipment.  The balconies were on the fifth and sixth storeys, which was a level where they could be rescued via aerial appliance, and in fact were ultimately rescued by aerial appliance.  The reason they had to wait for at least 20 minutes, and some say they waited longer than that, is that the aerial appliance had to be transported from Tara Street to Tallaght.  One of the tenants was quoted as saying: &quot;We kept thinking we were going to be burnt to ashes and maybe they would find our bodies hugging each other.&quot;<br\/><br\/>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and I got an answer saying:<\/p><blockquote>\tDublin Fire Brigade's fleet of aerial appliances consists of two turntable ladders based at Dublin Fire Brigade Headquarters in Tara Street, and a hydraulic platform based at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Fire Station, all of which can be deployed rapidly to anywhere in the functional area of the four local authorities. <\/blockquote> <p>Does the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, or the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, really think that 20 minutes is an adequate response time for someone who is trapped on a balcony with their home burning behind them and the entire building going up in flames?  The T&aacute;naiste agreed with me last week when I asked him about it, as did a firefighter to whom I spoke earlier, that the appliances need to be locally based.  Not every area across the city or the country where there is high-rise development will have a specific area for aerial appliances, but they need to be based in areas whereby they can rapidly get to areas when needed.  It is not the case that we only have high-rise building at Tara Street and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Action must be taken urgently to ensure that where there are high-rise developments that the aerial appliances that are needed can get there rapidly to save people's lives.  We need a commitment from the Government to have that, as well as a commitment to properly resource and staff the firefighting service so that the necessary training can be provided, but also that the appropriate service can be provided at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700045#SS00600","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638909600,"counter":372,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion, which gives me an opportunity to speak on it.  On a night like tonight when we have a storm, it is appropriate that we are talking about people who are on standby and waiting to help out if there is a need in the case of an emergency arising.  They are probably out there taking care of emergencies at the moment.  We must reflect on the fire service and what it does right across the country every day of the week.<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Department, the Minister and the former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, on their support to me in delivering new fire stations across Galway East.  I had the honour of officially opening the new fire station in Tuam approximately two years ago.  A new site has been located for the fire station in Athenry, the Part 8 planning has been completed, and a detailed design is now being prepared.  I hope that will go to tender once approval is given by the Department.<\/p>  <p>  A site has also been identified for Loughrea fire station and a design team has been appointed, with the approval of the Department.  It is very important to have the infrastructure right.  We also have a fine premises in Gort and in Mountbellew, which are all serving the east of the county.  The fire service in Galway looks after the city as well as the county.  The existing fire service site is not fit for purpose.  Galway County Council, in conjunction with Galway City Council and the departmental officials are identifying a site.  I am sure the Department will be very supportive of the acquisition of the site to make sure that we can build a fire station that is fit for purpose for the city of Galway and the surrounding areas.  We are getting there, from the point of view of infrastructure and buildings and proper state-of-the-art facilities for the firemen that serve us so well.<\/p>  <p>  One of the issues that arises has been alluded to in the context of Dublin, but it is not just a Dublin issue.  It is the issue of recruitment into the retained firefighters service, which is falling.  What is happening is that as people retire, younger people are not coming in.  There are several reasons for that.  We must try to make the retained firefighter position more attractive and give more recognition for the work.  The National Retained Firefighters Association, which looks after the interests of these fine men and women, has been trying to improve the resources to the fire service.  Retained firefighters are on call 24-7, 365 days a year with just 28 days off within that time and while they might not be involved all the time, they are on call.  That is a big sacrifice for anyone to make, but especially younger people.  It is time that we looked at the pay and conditions of retained firefighters.  It would not cost an arm and a leg.  In future, we should have a situation where all of our fire stations are properly resourced in terms of human resources.  We have a difficulty with recruitment.  Some fire stations, including Gort, Athenry and Mountbellew, have a shortage of personnel.  That is a worrying trend.<\/p>  <p>  We talk about giving recognition to the fire service and retained firefighters, and one of the asks of the National Retained Firefighters Association is that we provide a national uniform for the service.  This is something we can do that would not cost an arm and a leg but would give them an identity and a sense of purpose.  No more than the Garda or the Army, they would be recognised by their uniform.  That is a small ask but it is something we should do.<\/p>  <p>  When I was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works we had a lot of flooding in 2015 and 2016 and I remember the fire service carrying out Trojan work day and night to keep roads open.  It worked in conjunction with Galway County Council.  It is something that we take for granted because firefighters are not in the limelight.  They are called out to deal with accidents and tough scenarios and they do it as a matter of course.  They must be trained and given the necessary resources.  Training is important because in the modern digital era we must make sure the fire service is up to speed with modern techniques and that the equipment keeps pace with developments.  It is an investment, not a cost.  It is an investment in our safety and in people.  We must make sure that no more than with the Garda or the Army that we have a fire service that we are all proud of and that we can rely on and also have the comfort of knowing that they are happy in what they are doing.<\/p> <p>They are happy in what they are doing, but people are not going into it because younger people are not attracted to that retained firefighter role due to the commitment that has to be made, and the reward just is not there.<\/p> <p> I plead with the Minister and the Department to keep up the good work in terms of providing infrastructure and providing the tenders and the equipment that are needed, but also to please look at the human resource element for the fire service nationally, both in Dublin and right across the country.  That is where we need to invest time, effort and recognition for what they do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700046#TT00200","speaker":"1482","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638910200,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Our public services face a crisis.  They face under-funding, staff shortages and general lack of resources.  This has created intolerable working conditions for those who provide essential services and life-saving services.  This motion deals with just one element, which is staff shortages and the consequences for Dublin Fire Brigade.  I salute the firefighters on their professionalism and dedication to their job and to the citizens of this State, but that must demand respect from the powers that be, who have the responsibility to resource and support these workers.<\/p><p>Dublin Fire Brigade is the biggest fire service in the country, with 12 full-time and two part-time stations and with more than 900 staff.  However, recent months have seen staff shortages of up to 20%, with up to three quarters of our fire engines taken out of service for periods of time, leaving parts of the city without adequate cover.  If the people of the city realised this, they would be angry and shocked.<\/p><p>I contacted a SIPTU official, who said these types of shortages have consistently been the case.  Dublin Fire Brigade and Dublin City Council management accept there is a staffing shortage issue.  The official said SIPTU had called for accelerated recruitment to overtake the issue and that it would bring it to the Workplace Relations Commission to try to secure that.  He also said that, unfortunately, Dublin Fire Brigade has refused to commit to the required level of recruitment and has instead tried to leverage concessions by undermining the 2012 Dublin Fire Brigade control room agreement, which provides that Dublin Fire Brigade emergency service controllers would demonstrate fitness at the recruitment stage to progress in due course to firefighter, which most of them aspire to.  This is obviously the reason the firefighters feel they are forced into taking industrial action.<\/p><p>On one Monday in September, I received an email from SIPTU highlighting the crisis that the firefighters are looking at every day of the week.  At 9 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 September 2021, the following engines were off the road due to staff depletion: D81 fire appliance, Rathfarnham; D126 aerial appliance, Dun Laoghaire; D41 fire appliance, North Strand; District Office Delta, district officer, North Strand; D31 fire appliance, Phibsborough; and D101 fire appliance, Tara Street.  In addition, the following appliances were manned by one firefighter: D11 fire appliance, Donnybrook; D12 fire appliance, Donnybrook; D121 fire appliance, Dun Laoghaire; D21 fire appliance, Dolphins Barn; D22 fire appliance, Dolphins Barn; D71 fire appliance, Tallaght; and D72 fire appliance, Tallaght.  The following appliances were manned by two firefighters: D51 fire appliance, Finglas, with one pump station; and D91 fire appliance, Blanchardstown, with one pump station.  He went on to say that following overtime call backs and the contacting of staff on leave, the position at 10.30 p.m. for &quot;off the road&quot; was: D41 fire appliance, North Strand; District Office Delta, district officer, North Strand; D31 fire appliance, Phibsborough; and D101 fire appliance, Tara Street.<\/p><p>That is a crisis for these workers.  These fire engines cannot be manned so they are not able to go out to fire incidents.  However, as I said, despite recognition by Dublin City Council management that there is a staff shortage, it has refused to commit to the required level of recruitment.<\/p><p>In June 2018, Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy John Lahart and former Deputy John Curran put forward a motion, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, spoke in that debate to support the motion, which was not opposed under the then confidence and supply arrangement between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, said: &ldquo;We need to make sure that a clear message goes out from the D&aacute;il tomorrow and this evening that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann supports the operation of Dublin Fire Brigade, the Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance service and the fire-based emergency medical system.&rdquo;  He continued:<\/p> <blockquote> \tI spoke with the Minister, Deputy Harris, this evening and I suggested to him that after the planning of this motion I would sit down with him to work on the next steps forward.  Our colleagues in Dublin Fire Brigade want to know what will happen next.  A motion and debate in the D&aacute;il and ventilation of the issues are good and well but the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I want to see a roadmap forward to investing in Dublin Fire Brigade.  At the moment there should be 133 firefighters and paramedics and 36 officers on duty at all times maintaining front-line fire appliances.  However, there were only 129 and 29 officers due to start work last night.  There is a deficit in staff and appliances.  We need at least another four ambulances within the service and we should be proud of the service that is there.  <\/blockquote>  <p>That was in June 2018, so the Minister has obviously been on top of this issue since then.  He had direct contact with the Minister of the time and he was going to put in a plan to bring in more ambulance services and recruitment.  I know that Covid hit in 2020 but that was a year and a half after this debate in the D&aacute;il.  I would certainly like to see more urgency from the Minister, although I am glad he is not opposing the motion.  What I would like to see is that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage would have a quarterly report from the Minister on recruitment levels and the position on fire appliances, in particular how many have been brought into service in the previous quarter.  That type of accountability is going to be important for the future of fire services in Dublin.  I ask that the Deputies on that committee would demand that quarterly report so a close eye can be kept on this and there would be transparency as to what exactly is going on in our fire services.  This is particularly important around the point on the growth of high-rise apartments and to ensure Dublin Fire Brigade is given the resources and training to fight fires in high-rise buildings.  How is that training going to be given to the staff who are there at the moment?  As pointed out by other Deputies, these firefighters cannot be released because of the low numbers and they are already in a state of crisis, so how is that going to happen?  I urge the committee to ensure that transparency from the Minister every quarter as to where we are in regard to recruitment, appliances and firefighting in high-rise apartments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700047#UU00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1638910200,"counter":375,"content":"<p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this important motion.  I am certainly conscious, as we all are this evening, particularly in light of the storm, of the incredible resource of our emergency services and fire services across the country.  We thank them all for the work they are putting in.  There has been extraordinary work across the country to keep people safe, to get services up and running and to keep people moving, which is critical.  We appreciate all of that.<\/p>  <p>  I will try to respond to some of the questions.  I listened to the first half of the session with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  Questions were raised in the early part of the session by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe in regard to staff shortages and equipment.  Specifically on that point, the Department has initiated a review of the retained fire services to address training, recruitment and retention issues and, again, to strengthen the services.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Paul Murphy raised a question around high-rise developments, although I will not go into the specific incident that he raised.  Dublin Fire Brigade currently has three aerial appliances and one more is due for delivery in January, with one more to be ordered.  These are available for response throughout Dublin where and when required.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney raised the issue around the fire station in Tuam.  I thank him for his comments in regard to the progress that is being made around capital investment, in particular in regard to fire stations.<\/p> <p>The Deputy made the point that we are getting there in Galway city.  He also mentioned the issue of a national uniform and a standard kit.  He said that the uniform is not standard across the service and we take that point on board.<\/p> <p> The other issues raised were taking the fire brigade for granted, training and the modern technology that is an investment and not a cost.  Deputy Joan Collins raised the issue of staffing and adequate cover, specifically in Dublin.  I know this is putting a focus on all of our fire services throughout the country but I will update the Deputy on the most recent firefighter recruitment campaign.  It began in September 2019 and all recent fire brigade recruit training has taken place in the shadow of the pandemic, which has placed considerable additional challenges on the process.  The first class of recruits from that campaign began training in April 2020 and have taken up positions across the fire brigade.  A second recruit class began training in June 2021 and will finish this December with 36 recruits taking up positions.  A third recruit class of 45 will begin training early in February 2022 and provision has been made within Dublin City Council's budget for a fourth and final class of recruits from the remaining panel later in 2022.  On staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade, Dublin City Council as the employer has engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU and the WRC.  The issues under consideration include: manning levels; staff numbers; the role of operational intelligence risk assessment; implementation of efficiencies in the operation of special appliances; recruitment; and the schedule of recruitment to ensure staffing level continuity.  Those are just quick responses to the issues raised by Deputies since I took over this part of the debate.<\/p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and I would like to thank all of the Deputies for raising these issues.  We have heard the concerns of Deputies raised this evening but it is important to put it all into context.  No one can or would deny that Dublin Fire Brigade provides an invaluable fire, rescue and ambulance service for the greater Dublin area and there is no doubt that the service saves countless lives, as well as preventing damage to residential and commercial property daily.  Dublin Fire Brigade, which is part of Dublin City Council, provides fire and rescue services for the four Dublin local authority areas: Dublin City Council; Fingal County Council; South Dublin County Council; and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  It also provides an ambulance service in these areas for the HSE on an agency basis.  Dubliners are undoubtedly proud of the men and women who provide these services to nearly 1.5 million people across an area of 356 square miles and at a time of risk to their own lives in doing so.<\/p> <p> As we have discussed, it is true that the Covid pandemic has presented huge challenges in recruitment and training of new staff, resulting in staffing shortages in recent times.  However, my Department and Dublin City Council are actively engaged in working to address the situation.  I have outlined the current recruitment drive and processes that have taken place to date.  As my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, has already stated, firefighters and paramedics are not just hired; there is also an extensive recruitment and training process to follow before suitable candidates are appointed and this takes time.  Dublin Fire Brigade management is following this process.  I would like to again emphasise that much is going on in the background.  Dublin City Council, as the employer, has been engaged in an extended process with firefighter representative bodies F&oacute;rsa and SIPTU, as well as with the WRC.  I am glad to say there has been some progress in a number of areas, some of which will alleviate pressures caused by current staffing arrangements.  Unfortunately, no final agreement has been reached.  I call for all parties to re-engage with the process as a matter of urgency and to use the industrial relations machinery that are in place.  Everyone wants a positive resolution that is acceptable to all stakeholders and we want it as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p> While local authorities, as the provider and employer of fire services and their staff, have a yearly budget of &euro;240 million for same, this budget is supplemented by my Department&rsquo;s fire services capital programme.  This provides for investment in: appliances; vehicles; equipment; upgrading of existing stations; and construction of new stations.  This Government&rsquo;s continued support for all fire services is reflected in the most recent fire services capital programme, which will see an investment of &euro;61 million between 2021 and 2025.  Nationally we will see: six new fire stations built; continued support for the construction of a further 12 new stations already under construction; nine fire station refurbishments; and the allocation of 35 new fire engines.  In previous programmes in 2015 and 2017, Dublin Fire Brigade saw the delivery of six appliances at an approximate cost of &euro;2 million.  It will continue to benefit from my Department&rsquo;s capital programme with a current allocation of six new vehicles.  Sanction has also been given for the purchase of a new turntable ladder at a cost of &euro;850,000.  New vehicles have been sanctioned and are being ordered, specced, built and delivered.  As importantly, as officials from my Department are actively engaging with Dublin Fire Brigade management on the strategic development of fire service infrastructure going into the future, discussions include the upgrading of existing stations and new station proposals.  My Department is always available to consider additional proposals as they may arise.<\/p> <p> Training has also been raised as a point of concern by many Deputies.  The issue of recruitment and training of new recruits has already been addressed by the Minister.  I would like to reiterate that the national director for fire emergency management, NDFEM, in my Department provides a central training programme that supports all fire services, including Dublin Fire Brigade.  The annual programme of courses for the fire services officers and firefighters supports the ability of fire authorities to deliver efficient and effective fire and rescue services.  The NDFEM also supports fire service delivery through the preparation of appropriate standards and guidance on the management of a large range of fire services and operational activities, including fighting fires in high-rise buildings.  A key element over the last decade has been the preparation and circulation of standard operational guidance; a suite of 47 documents developed between 2010 and 2012 by fire service personnel and issued by the NDFEM to all local authorities for consideration and adoption.  The NDFEM programme complements Dublin Fire Brigade&rsquo;s training programmes, which take place in its training centre, the O&rsquo;Brien Institute and other venues.  As high-rise firefighting has been raised by a number of Deputies, I should mention that high-rise training modules have been delivered to all new recruits and newly promoted officers within Dublin Fire Brigade.  The programme is being assessed for sign-off for broader upskilling of all officers and firefighters as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> The Department, my colleague, the Minister, and I, remain committed to an invested in and supported Dublin Fire Brigade.  We will continue to work with all parties in an effort to resolve the outstanding issues and support ongoing initiatives.  We cannot praise Dublin Fire Brigade and our fire services across the country enough for their collaborative efforts with other emergency services throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  As I said at the outset, we deeply appreciate the dedication, skill and courage of our fire services in today&rsquo;s response to Storm Barra.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700047#UU00300","speaker":"1512","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638910800,"counter":377,"content":"<p>In 2005 firefighters in Bray staged a walkout from the fire station in Bray, arising from concerns regarding the condition of the retained service in Wicklow.  As a county councillor at the time I spoke to them, and I was the only public representative to do so.  The walkout was led by sub-officer Brian Murray.  They outlined a litany of issues within the service that were impacting their ability to do their jobs.  Call vetting, recruitment and retention and underinvestment in the retained service were but a few of the issues raised.  Brian told me at the time that someone would die unless the issues they were highlighting were addressed.  Two years later, on 26 September 2007, sub-officer Brian Murray and firefighter Mark O&rsquo;Shaughnessy lost their lives in the line of duty.  They died protecting their community but they died because of the systematic failures within a service that is not fit for purpose.<\/p>  <p>  Here we are 14 years after Brian and Mark&rsquo;s deaths and things in the retained service are as bad if not worse.  During a recent conference of the chief fire officers, the retained fire service was described as not being fit for purpose and I agree.  There have been instances where fire services have been unable to respond to emergencies due to a shortage of firefighters and in other instances some fire stations have been forced to close.  Firefighters are on call 24-7 and 365 days of the year and many simply cannot take time off due to a shortage of personnel.<\/p> <p>In County Clare, for example, 24 firefighters have been recruited since 2016 but 16 have already left the service and this is being replicated right across the State within the retained service.  Bray fire station which serves a population of over 35,000 should be a two-pump station but for the last five years it has been reduced to a one-pump station, with Greystones providing backup.  This has obvious knock-on implications for Greystones and the wider area.  Necessity demands that Bray be a full-time service but because the local authority is unable to fund it, this simply has not happened.  Fire services are being delivered on the basis of a local authority budget as opposed to a risk assessment.  <\/p> <p> Recently the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management approved a proposal for undertaking a review of the model of local authority retained service delivery.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, informed me that the objective of this review is to explore and understand the issues impacting service delivery, to undertake research and analysis, and to propose options which will underpin the continuing provision of effective and inclusive local authority fire services into the future.  The model used for the retained fire service is the root cause of many of the difficulties in the service.  I have long advocated for the creation of a national fire authority in line with one of the key recommendations of the Farrell Grant Sparks report of 2002 and this should also be included in the review which is being rolled out by the Department.  As many would say, there are simply too many chiefs and not enough firefighters in the service.  There are many issues within the fire service but the failure to address the issues of recruitment and retention is literally a matter of life and death.  I do not want to see the death or injury of another firefighter or member of the public in Wicklow or anywhere else in this State due to the failure to address the serious issues within the service.  If the issue of staffing levels is not addressed, the Government is endangering the welfare of firefighters and the public throughout the State.  The aforementioned review must not be a whitewash either.  It must look at all of the issues including the structures within the retained service.  The Minister must also commit to publishing the final report once complete and to fully implementing any findings to ensure that we have a retained service that is fit for purpose and fit for the 21st century.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700048#VV00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638911400,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I thank my party colleagues and other Deputies for their support for this motion.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the motion and acknowledge the passion he expressed for Dublin Fire Brigade.  However, as fire officers have continuously said to me in the course of meetings with them in recent weeks, they want support now.  They do not have very much confidence in anyone to deliver at the moment.  They want to see something happen for them.<\/p><p>On the sum of &euro;61 million in capital funding, I believe that is for the fire services in the entire State, including Dublin Fire Brigade and the retained fire services, but it is my understanding that the chief fire officer has said that he needs &euro;80 million for Dublin alone.  We can clearly see the disparity between what is required for a modern fire service and what is being provided.  When we are throwing figures around, we must be clear and concise about the impact these sums will have.<\/p><p>I wish to focus on a number of issues that I did not have time to deal with earlier, including the growing population in Dublin city and county and the height and scale of buildings, which others have raised.  When firefighters told me recently about the engines they were using, to say I was dumbfounded is not an exaggeration.  If the people of Dublin really knew of the condition and age of the equipment being used by firefighters they would be genuinely shocked.  I have been told that Dublin fire brigade has 21 engines and as has been confirmed in the House, the chief fire officer has committed to the provision of four new engines, two before Christmas and two after.  A lot of the current stock is between 15 and 17 years old, with 2003, 2004 and 2005 engines that have over 200,000 km on their clocks.  It is unbelievable that some of the most highly qualified and professional firefighters in the world are expected to carry out their role in such old trucks.  Taxi drivers are not allowed to operate in cars that are more than ten years old and yet we expect fire officers to work with engines that are 15 or 16 years old.  I have been informed that although four new engines are on the way, some of the equipment that is coming into the country is already five or six years old.  We are getting the cast-offs of some other fire services.  How can the Department justify not giving such a vital service the funding required so that firefighters can carry out their job safely and effectively?  The Minister spoke about the amount of funding being provided but if it is not sufficient to cover what is required then it is not enough.  <\/p><p>Every organisation needs a strategic plan that is based on the needs of the service that is being provided to the community but it is clear that there is no such signed-off, strategic plan as required under section 26 of the Fire Services Act 1981.  I am concerned about the timelines for the development of the fire service, especially in terms of the growth of Dublin Fire Brigade.  The chief fire officer has mentioned certain capital projects which will be delivered in eight to ten years but that is not sufficient for Dublin.  The city and county is growing as we speak and has been for the last 30 years.  I live in Dublin west.  There is a fire station in Coolmine, around the corner from my house, which has one fire engine, one fire officer and seven staff, including two Dublin Fire Brigade ambulance paramedics as part of the team, serving a population of over 110,000 people.  In the next number of years, that population will grow to 140,000.  There are 50,000 people working in the industrial units in Ballycoolin and Tyrrelstown.  Is that sufficient?  Absolutely not.  Do we need another engine in that fire station?  Yes, without a shadow of a doubt.  Adamstown has already been mentioned.  It has been on the map since 2020 and still there is no fire station.  The most incredible example is in North Strand.  A Portakabin was delivered for the additional staff that were hired and they were told they would have a new fire station in two years.  How many years ago was that?  It was 13 years ago.  Staff were told 13 years ago that a temporary Portakabin would be <i>in situ<\/i>for two years and then they would have a new station.  <\/p><p>When I listen to fire officers, what I hear is complete and utter frustration and a lack of trust in what is being said to them by the Government, the chief fire officer and Dublin City Council.  Everybody has given a clear outline of exactly what is required from the Government, Dublin City Council and the chief fire officer.  I urge the Government and all of those with the power, authority and funding to listen to the workers.  They are the people we asked to go out onto the front line today.  When the rest of us were told to stay at home, we asked them to go out.  During the pandemic, we are asked to work from home and they are asked to go out and put their lives at risk.  They do not want applause; they want to be respected.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700049#WW00200","speaker":"1476"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638911400,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna (At&oacute;g&aacute;il) - Questions (Resumed) - Ceisteanna ar Sonra&iacute;odh Uain D&oacute;ibh - Priority Questions","time":1638912000,"counter":382,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700050#XX00200"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","time":1638912000,"counter":383,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700050#XX00300"},{"type":"question","time":1638912000,"counter":384,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[60565\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700050#XX00400","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if she will consider allocating additional funding to the LEADER programme for 2023 to 2027, given the recently announced indicative allocation of &euro;180 million for this period and in consideration of the fact that LEADER funding has stagnated since the previous period and has dropped significantly since the period from 2007 to 2013; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","time":1638912000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I wish to ask the Minister about the indicative funding that has been disclosed in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and what will be available under the LEADER programme from 2023 to 2027.

There is a problem with the physical coverage of those wireless services.  There is an opportunity to improve coverage if local authorities and State agencies provide sites to these wireless operators, but it is key those sites are provided free of charge.  We are talking about services that will have a very short lifespan.  It is important that, first, local authorities provide the sites and, second, they do not look at this as a cash cow but as a way of facilitating delivery of wireless services pending the completion of the fibre build.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700051#YY01300","speaker":"1603","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638913200,"counter":409,"content":"<p>I will outline the specific actions that will be discussed and agreed with members before we publish our work programme for the task force for 2022 to 2024.

Our Rural Future commits to investing significantly in remote working facilities and to examining the potential to introduce specific incentives to encourage remote workers to relocate to rural areas, as part of budget 2022.  I have instructed my officials to examine options for such an incentive mechanism, building on the connected hubs network, in particular.  It is critical this is done in the right and responsible way and a number of approaches are currently under consideration.<\/p><p>To date, more than &euro;83 million has been provided by my Department, through various funding streams, to support the development of digital hubs and remote working facilities.  The rural regeneration and development fund and the town and village renewal scheme both support the establishment of digital hubs.  Under this year's schemes, projects that bring vacant properties in town centres back into use as remote working hubs or repurposed existing community or publicly owned buildings in town and village centres to facilitate remote working were eligible for funding.<\/p><p>My Department also supports the development of the connected hubs network, found at <i>connectedhubs.ie<\/i>.  Some 170 hubs are live on the platform, with this number growing every week.  Earlier this year, I also awarded almost &euro;9 million in funding through the connected hubs funding stream to further support hubs throughout the country.  The development of a national hubs network is a key commitment in Our Rural Future and I am committed to continuing my Department's support for the development of remote working hubs, in recognition of the vital role they can play in our post-Covid recovery.<\/p><p>I absolutely believe in remote working or, connected working, as I prefer to call it.  It is a game changer for rural Ireland.  Before the pandemic, remote working was just a concept or an aspiration.  Now, because of Covid, it is an everyday working reality for thousands of workers.  I want to support people who want to live and work in their own community.  Obviously, the public health advice is again that if one can work from home, one should.<\/p><p>However, there are huge opportunities here for regional development.  Many major multinational companies have told their staff they can work remotely for the long term and that is very positive.  I know there is one multinational in the Deputy's county of Cork.  A huge part its workforce is working remotely and that is part of its policy.  That is the way forward and we in the Department want to support this.<\/p><p>There are many benefits, across the board, to remote working.  We know them all.  People live and work in their locality.  It enables young people to avail of cheaper house prices in the country and less time spent commuting, which is also good for the environment.  The reality is if one is an office worker and has good phone and broadband coverage, which is guaranteed in these remote working spaces, one can do the same job.  I will be a bit parochial here - one can do the same job in Ballybay as in Ballsbridge.  We need to seize the momentum around remote working.  My Department is investing in the development of remote working hubs through schemes such as the &euro;1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, the town and village renewal scheme and the connected hubs fund.<\/p><p>As the Deputy knows, there are plenty of examples of old buildings in our town centres that can be renovated and used as hubs.  There are a number of investments in north-west Cork.  There is the gteic i mB&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh, which got &euro;30,000 for the connected hubs funding there.  Macroom enterprise centre got &euro;68,000 and that is just to name a couple.  Of course, the digital innovation hubs strategy was in the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, for Cork, of &euro;206,000 and in Skibereen, the Ludgate Hub, with which I know Deputy Moynihan is very familiar, got &euro;152,000.

My Department has a number of schemes that communities can avail of for the upkeep, enhancement or establishment of community centres.  The Department provides small capital grants for the improvement of facilities through the community enhancement programme.  The 2021 programme provided funding of &euro;4.5 million and will be available again in 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The &euro;9 million community activities fund was recently launched to support community and voluntary groups impacted by Covid-19.  This fund will help community groups, particularly in disadvantaged areas, with their running costs, such as utility or insurance bills, as well as with improvements to their facilities.  In addition, the &euro;49 million community services programme supports more than 420 community organisations, including community centres, to provide local social, economic and environmental services through a social enterprise model.  Funding is provided as a contribution towards the cost of employing staff in these organisations.  <\/p>  <p>  The Minister referenced the town and village renewal scheme.  It is also relevant to community centres, supporting the repurposing of community buildings in town centres to facilitate remote working and other projects to bring vacant and derelict buildings back into use.

For that new role to be put in place, a large number of community centres need to be upgraded, particularly in rural areas where there is no broadband provision.  I know of an area where there is no broadband, landline or mobile phone connection, but the local community centre has a hub in place, which is extremely important for that area.  Other areas do not have access to a hub for people to work from.  In one particular area, where more than 900 primary schoolchildren are in four schools, we are working to try to get a broadband hub into the local community centre, in respect of which the lack of engagement from the local authority surprises me.  There is a need to examine the involvement of local authorities in the context of whether they are being proactive enough.

It might be done as part of a planning condition.  I am involved in a small community centre that is used by 1,000 people a week.

Regarding the community activities fund and the community enhancement programme, decisions in terms of local allocations are made by the local community development committees, LCDCs, in a bottom-up approach.  The main feedback we get is that the schemes are very popular and are, in fact, oversubscribed, which is why we were glad to put more funding in that direction this year as well.  In terms of the strategy, it should fit in with the local economic and community plan, but it is the LCDCs making the calls in terms of where the funding goes, with the proviso that it goes to the areas that need it most.<\/p>  <p>  I take Deputy Stanton's point about scoping, broadly speaking.  As I mentioned earlier, community centres across the country have a different life.  If there is an area with no centre and a need for one, my first question would be to the local authority as to why it did not plan for that.  I see it in my constituency, where there are large housing estates and the facilities, including community centres, were not put in when they were built.  The first thing to do is to see whether the local authority can provide a piece of land to get things going.

We need more of them and, where there is a deficit, that needs to be identified and encouragement provided to local authorities to address it.

As part of the preparatory works, the National Maritime College of Ireland, NMCI, was instructed by Galway County Council to develop a model simulation for the harbour, which will inform the business case options for the development.  The NMCI hosted a group of islanders, ferry operators and officials at its facility in July for a demonstration of the initial iteration of the marine simulation.  Following feedback from the various parties that attended the demonstration, the NMCI is furthering the development of the simulation.  It is expected that the updated simulation will give a more precise and accurate overview of how the conditions at the pier affect the specific key vessels that use it.  Galway County Council is in ongoing contact with the ferry and cargo operators to collate the technical specifications which the NMCI will use in its updated simulation.

In 1996, the then Minister, on behalf of the State, acknowledged to community leaders who had been campaigning on the drugs issue for years that the then Government had not listened.  The Minister set up a partnership structure that included community representation as a right to ensure that would never happen again.<\/p>  <p>  With the publication of the midterm review, it appears that the Department is attempting to bring that partnership to an end.  In the review document, the Department is effectively writing the community sector out of the national drugs strategy.  It is altering the definition of \"community\" to remove the engagement with the wider community and has set out proposals for new structures that would remove the community networks that represent their sectors as core constituents of the strategy.  There is no evidence base for the proposed changes to the structures, and adequate time and space have not been allowed for the networks to consider them.  A brake has been put on the process, though.  The national oversight committee was supposed to meet on Friday but the Minister has agreed that the Department will hold further discussions with the community sector.<\/p>  <p>  The community sector has noticed that something is going on within the drug strategy.  It is either a political decision, a HSE-driven decision or a Civil Service decision to try to take the community out of \"community\".  I do not support that and I hope to hear a positive response from the Minister of State to the effect that the community will be part of the structure and will be listened to within it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700059#GGG00900","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1638917400,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I do not know which genius thought this one up but this is the last thing that anyone who knows anything about the drugs task forces, the national drugs strategy and community involvement in drugs services would dream up.  Communities have been central to the partnership and the framework of trying to tackle the problem within them.  They are the experts in many ways.  It is a pity that Departments, Ministers and so on sometimes dream up changes to things that are working.  If it is not broken, do not fix it, especially where communities are involved.  It took a lot of time to win the communities' trust.  I was there during the time of Concerned Parents Against Drugs and the Coalition of Communities Against Drugs, COCAD, when communities had considerable mistrust of the system as they saw it - the Garda, the then health boards, Ministers and so on.  Communities bought into the partnership approach.  They saw it as an opportunity to frame national policy on an issue that was affecting them directly as communities, mothers, fathers or people who were addicted to drugs.  They were able to inform that policy instead of having a policy that was dreamed up somewhere else being imposed on them.<\/p>  <p>  It is sad that the situation has come to this and that there is an \"uncivil\" row, as it were.  I do not know where the title \"civil society forum\" comes from.  It would usually be \"civic\".  We need to consider what the likes of Mr. Fergus McCabe fought for.  It was not to be excluded or sidelined.

Last week, it was about dismantling the local jobs clubs, and this week it relates to community involvement in the drugs strategy.  There seems to be a direct threat from the Government to communities and their resilience.  Any chance the Government has to erode such resilience is grabbed with both hands.<\/p>  <p>  I am a former member of the Clondalkin drug and alcohol task force.  I worked on front-line community drugs services for many years.  The last one I worked on was in Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh&rsquo;s area in Inchicore.

I welcome this opportunity to confirm for the House the continued participation of the community and voluntary sector in the national oversight committee for the national drugs strategy.<\/p><p><b><\/b>I convened a meeting of the national oversight committee on Friday.  My door is always open to meeting various groups.  I have met CityWide on many occasions.  It has been part of various deputations I have met previously.  The meeting was attended by three representatives from the community and voluntary sector, representing CityWide, the National Voluntary Drug and Alcohol Sector and Uisce, the service user organisation.  A fourth position remains vacant and will be filled in due course.  At the meeting, I provided reassurance that there is no proposal to remove community and voluntary groups from the national oversight committee.  This appears to have arisen from a misunderstanding by CityWide of the Department's proposals to establish a civil society on drugs.  I also dispute the accuracy of the claim that community groups are being written out of the national drugs strategy.  To be clear: Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, a health-led response to drugs and alcohol use, remains in place as the national drug strategy until 2025.<\/p><p>As the strategy is a dynamic process, there is flexibility to introduce new actions to address emerging issues in the period from 2021 to 2025.  To this end, I recently published the mid-term review of the actions in the strategy.  Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for 2021 to 2025 were identified.  These priorities strengthen the health-led approach, reflect commitments in the programme for Government and align with the EU drugs strategy and action plan for 2021 to 2025.  I assure Deputies that the priorities complement and build on the five goals in the national drugs strategy.  The interagency approach involving a partnership between statutory, community and voluntary bodies remains central to the strategy, as does strengthening the resilience of communities to respond to the drug problem.<\/p><p>One of the strategic priorities is to address the social determinants and consequences for drug use in disadvantaged communities.  This priority recognises the additional challenges arising from drug use in disadvantaged communities, including the Traveller community.  It will address the underlying social and economic determinants that increase the prevalence of problematic drug and alcohol use in certain communities.  It will also tackle the criminality and antisocial behaviour associated with the drug trade that impose a heavy burden on communities.  These issues require action across the Government to promote community development and community safety.  The drug and alcohol task forces and community drug projects also have important roles.<\/p><p>There are a number of horizontal themes to support the strategic priorities.  The first is the involvement of service users in the design and delivery of services based on a human rights perspective and the promotion of health literacy.  The second is active and meaningful participation of civil society in the development, implementation and evaluation of policies and services.  The third is good governance, accountability and mutual respect by all partners.  The fourth is cross-sectoral funding and the targeting of additional resources.  I believe that the oversight structures to drive the implementation of the strategic priorities for the period from 2021 to 2025 will strengthen the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society organisations in developing national policy, including the lived experience of those affected by drug and alcohol addiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700060#HHH00200","speaker":"1608"},{"type":"speech","time":1638918000,"counter":516,"content":"<p>It is fair to say that communities have been failed over the years.

I believe Covid taught us one thing and that is the value, where it is a viable option, of caring for loved ones at home, particularly in old age.  Moreover, that is often the desire of families.  We all resolved after Covid to ensure that this would be a more viable option and that more people who want to be cared for at home, both by themselves and by their families, would be given that option.  To do that, we need strong State supports.  It is a very economical way of doing this but to do it, we need home care packages and home carers.  However, in reality, the opposite is happening.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a few examples.  I know the case of a lady with multiple sclerosis and diabetes who has been awarded 42 hours, so that is approved.  The agency that was given this package by the HSE has handed it back and there are now no carers.  It handed it back on the understanding that it did not have the carers.  As the HSE has stated that it also does not have the carers, she is only in receipt of 13 hours weekly that is provided by carers.  There is another case where the carer was not replaced when she went on annual leave and no arrangements were put in place to cover the carer's leave.  Everybody is entitled to leave.  There is another case of a constituent who was awarded 16 hours of home care per week but has not been given more than six hours in any given week.  On and on it goes.<\/p>  <p>  I want to highlight these particular cases because it is a human tragedy that this is happening.  Of course, it is making people reassess the option of caring for people in their own home environment which, as I said, is often the choice.  However, it is not viable if people do not have the support.<\/p>  <p>  What I am hoping to hear tonight is that the Government has a plan to address the issues.  One of the fundamental issues, by the way, is that the profession of caring in the home is not a particularly well-paid profession.  As I have argued for years, there is too big a gap between what the top of the public service is paid and what the bottom of the public service is paid, and we need to address this.  It is coming back to haunt us that this issue has been allowed to go on.  I hope the Minister of State will have some answers tonight.  I know she is sympathetic.  If she needs support in looking for the money, she will get the support of every Member of the House in making a stand.  People who are caring and being cared for deserve the best and home is the best in many cases, although I am not ruling out the incredible role that nursing homes also play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700061#JJJ00500","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1638918600,"counter":527,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  I notice Deputy Joan Collins is also here and listening; we had a discussion earlier in the back corridor, and many other Deputies have raised the situation with me.<\/p>  <p>  The issue is not funding.  If the issue was funding, I would be able to go and look for more funding and I feel I would secure it.  My budget for home care for this year is &euro;666 million, it increased by &euro;150 million this year and I have secured the same increase for next year, which is to deliver 24 million hours of home care.  The Deputy is right that Covid has taught us the value of caring for people at home.  I want to see the Sl&aacute;intecare model, that is, the right care at the right time in the right place, as close to home as possible.<\/p>  <p>  By the end of October, almost 17 million hours had been provided to over 54,000 people, which is about 2.5 million more hours compared to the period last year, so we have made a lot of improvements this year alone.  Significant inroads have been achieved in reducing the waiting list for funding approval for new and additional services.  In January 2020, there were 7,800 people waiting for funding and it was down to 400 in September 2021, so I have managed to reduce the number of those waiting for funding for home care by 88%.<\/p>  <p>  Therein lies the problem and the problem has got worse during the year.  There are delays between the approval of funding and the delivery of home support hours, and the number of people in this category has increased steadily this year, primarily due to staff capacity issues.  At the end of September this year, there were 4,933 people assessed and waiting for care to become available but the funding has been provided to provide the package.  That is the most frustrating part for me - the fact I actually have the funding for the first year ever.  I often stood on the other side at the House, talking to my predecessor, the former Minister of State, Jim Daly, and the funding was not available at the time due to different issues.  Now, the funding is available, which is what makes it most frustrating.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is acutely aware there are increasing capacity issues across both direct and indirect provision.  It continues to advertise on an ongoing basis for healthcare assistants and it recruits as many suitable candidates as possible.  For example, the community healthcare organisation, CHO, covering the Deputy's area, CHO 4, is recruiting 300 home care assistants and that was put out for advertising last week.  Every single HSE area and every single CHO is trying to recruit as many people as possible.  They are recruiting through a variety of channels, both at local level and through the shared services office of the HSE's health business services.  I recently started a round of meetings with the older person's lead in each CHO to discuss these challenges and to discuss day-care respite and community step-down.  If we want to keep the throughput in our acute hospitals, the only way we can do that is by having the supports at home.  I am also meeting regularly with Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, which represents the private providers, and they also continue to recruit home support workers.<\/p>  <p>  I have established a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  The role of the group will be to facilitate the views of stakeholders and to examine workforce challenges in home support and nursing homes.  The areas to be considered include recruitment, retention, training, career development and the sustainable employment of home care workers into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700061#JJJ00600","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"speech","time":1638918600,"counter":528,"content":"<p>I take my hat off to the Minister of State for all that has been done.

However, because of the condition he is in, this requires two people.

We used to have the problem of getting the hours granted and now we have the problem of getting the carers.  There is a problem this society has to look at.  I recall the late Frank Prendergast, who was a Labour Deputy in this House and a trade unionist, talking to me time and again about how over the years the gap in how we pay people was growing.

We are all aware that terms and conditions vary from the private sector to the HSE.  The HSE pays approximately &euro;16 per hour plus travel.  Some of the private operators pay the minimum wage and others pay more.  There are challenges there and those operators are losing staff to the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  We have had a lot of talks with the HSE and a few recommendations have gone to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to be examined.  For example, we have some young people who avail of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants who are allowed to work a certain amount of hours per month and we are trying to double that.  We are also considering supporting people who receive a Department of Social Protection payment working a set amount of hours, as happens with the disability grant, so that they would not lose their supports and their medical cards would not be affected.

I also acknowledge her personal interest and involvement in this issue since it arose last summer.  Last June, the announcement was made that the Owenacurra Centre would close on 31 October and that in the interim all residents, and their families where appropriate, would be consulted.  It was also promised that the will and preference of the residents would be paramount when suggestions were made on possible new placements for residents, of which there were 19, although I understand there are 15 now.  The reason given for the closure at the time was the building was no longer fit for purpose in that it did not allow for the needs of a modern residential and day service and it had been criticised by the regulator.  There were also questions about safety.<\/p>  <p>  One of the families asked me earlier to ask the Minister of State a question.  We understand that some works have been carried out at the centre recently.  Is she satisfied that these works will enable the residents to stay there safely for the time being and are there plans to carry out other interim works in respect of safety?  That is an issue that families and residents are concerned about.  I hope she can tell me this evening that she is satisfied that it is safe.  We know it is not fit for purpose for reasons of size, scale, design and so forth but can the Minister of State tell me this evening that nobody will be evicted from the centre against his or her will?  That would mean that people could relax, engage and wait until a proper placement was proposed to them.  It would be helpful for her to tell us that.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the broader policy on 24-hour staffed residential services.  We have been informed that there is an extensive community-based service operating across the local area, including a home-based treatment team in multiple specialist services, which is good.  I applaud that because we want to keep people in their homes and communities as far and as long as possible.  I understand that a residential type setting is being sought to provide \"a supported mode of living locally\" and that the site will be used for future mental health services.  What is meant by &ldquo;a supported mode of living locally&rdquo;?  Supported living means people can live but it is not the same as 24-hour staffing.  The question arises: what is the future of 24-hour staffed residential services such as those provided by the Owenacurra Centre?  These have been described to me as being a type of step-down facility.  We know that the kind of supports and services that have been provided there have been exemplary and that people have benefited from them.  Could the Minister of State outline Government policy on 24-hour staffed residential services?  Recently she told me: \"There are no issues with community residences for mental health.&rdquo;  Does that include the type of service provided in the Owenacurra Centre?  If this centre closes, will east Cork be the only region in the county of Cork without such a service?  Will east Cork have 24-hour residential services into the future?<\/p>  <p>  What are the long-term plans for the site?  The HSE stated it is engaging with the local authority about long-term plans to use it for mental health services and so on.  The local people value the 24-hour staffed service for a certain number of people who benefit from that.  We know that there are other people who would benefit from supported living, that more people would benefit from being at home and that more people want to live in congregated settings and need that kind of support.  The Owenacurra Centre is not a congregated setting; it is one of the steps on the way to recovery.  Some people have been living there all their lives.  These people know the area and they can go in and out of the shops, down the street and so forth and it is their home.<\/p>  <p>  Can the Minister of State confirm that the place is safe and that people can relax as they will not be moved from the centre against their will?  What is the policy on 24-hour staffed residential services nationally and in east Cork?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700062#KKK00400","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1638919200,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his question and for the constructive way he has phrased it.  As he and I are aware, there are 19 residents living in the Owenacurra Centre and it is their home.  I will not go over the history of it but in June 2021, the HSE notified the Department of its decision to close the Owenacurra Centre.  The current building is not fit for purpose and cannot be brought to the standard required.  The works being undertaken in the facility currently are to ensure that it is safe for the residents who live there.  The Deputy will be aware, for example, that the kitchen was removed because it was a fire hazard and that food was being brought in from another facility.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE's focus is on the impact of this closure on residents and their families in order that the will and preference of each individual will be heard like the Deputy said.  Since the HSE informed staff and residents of this decision in June, it has been consulting with them on an ongoing basis and this consultation is continuing.  The multidisciplinary team has met with all of the residents and their families where the person wishes to have family members involved, which is not always the case, and where the family members wish to attend meetings, which also is not always the case, to discuss their options.  Unfortunately, I have to point that out.  The will and preference of each resident is core to this process.  I spoke to the area lead for mental health, Mr. Kevin Morrison, today and the relocation process is progressing.  As of today, all the residents have had their needs assessed so that they can be appropriately placed in accordance with their assessed needs.  The latest position is that of the 19 residents in Owenacurra, four have already transferred.<\/p> <p><font color=\"#212100\">Two people have moved to nursing homes, one person has transitioned to a high support hostel, and another individual required admission to acute care but has a place secured with St. Catherine's continuing care <\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">centre.  <\/font><font color=\"#212100\">It is planned that a further two people will be moved to alternative placements this <\/font><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">week, <\/font><font color=\"#212100\">one to a nursing home and another to St. Stephen's hospital.  These residents are being moved to a nursing home because their physical health challenges now outweigh their mental health challenges.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#212100\"> Residents will not be moved until appropriate placements have been found for each person based on their individual assessed needs, will and preference.  I can give Deputy Stanton a guarantee on that.  The Mental Health Commission is being informed of every single one of these moves and has asked to be kept apprised of what is happening.  The priority of the Government and the HSE is the welfare of the remaining residents in the centre and that was always my concern too.  <\/font>While some people may require ongoing continuing care, others will be facilitated to live in lower support settings, based on their assessed needs.  A residential-type setting for a number of residents is being sought to provide a supported mode of living locally.  By this, I mean the community houses I spoke about last week.  There are approximately 1,200 community houses throughout the country which provide ongoing, continuing care.  Typically four or five people would live in these homes and they would be supported within the community.  A possible location has also been identified to restore the day service in the town and negotiations are under way on its use.  Deputy Stanton will appreciate that this is commercially sensitive but HSE Estates is involved and progress is being made.  It is very important that the day care centre opens up as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Importantly, the Owenacurra site will be used in the future to build supported living accommodation for mental health service users and discussions have commenced with the local authority to explore options.  These discussions are at an early stage and the HSE will proceed with developing proposals to this end over the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700062#KKK00500","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1638919800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her very positive response, particularly her assurance that r<font color=\"#212100\">esidents will not be moved &quot;until appropriate placements have been found for each person based on their individual assessed needs, will and preference<\/font>.&quot;  That means that no pressure will be put on people and they will have to agree before they move to location X, Y or Z.  That is hugely important and will be of great relief to the residents and their families.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to explain what she means by building &quot;supported living accommodation for mental health service users&quot;.  I want to go back to the second part of my question this evening which is in respect of a 24-hour staffed service.  I envisage a stepped service involving places like St. Stephen's, from which people can move down to somewhere like Midleton where there is a 24-hour staffed service, then there is the supported living which may not be a 24-hour staffed service and finally, care in the community and at home.  They are all important but I would like the Minister of State to elaborate on the 24-hour staffed service.  There is only one such service in east Cork which serves Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and right up to Glenville.  It is a huge area.  There are four such services in north Cork and there are others in west Cork and across the country.  These services are 24-hour staffed, with people living in their homes but if they need support any time of the day or night, it is there for them.  The policy, which is the Minister of State's responsibility, is what I want to tease out this evening.  What is Government policy around this?  Is it the intention of the HSE that such a service will be provided in east Cork?  I would like to see a small centre in Youghal, another in Midleton and one in Cobh but there must be at least one such service in east Cork.  This comes back to the question as to whether this service is required.  Is a 24-hour staffed service part of the overall plan?  It could be described as supported living but a bit more intensive than what the Minister of State described in her earlier response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700063#LLL00200","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1638919800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>Improving all aspects of mental health service delivery is a priority for me and that is what I try to do when I secure as much funding as possible, particularly for the recruitment and retention of staff.  As we all know, the delivery of mental health services depends on the staff we have.  Deputy Stanton referred to the fact that east Cork will be left without a facility like Owenacurra.  The national implementation and monitoring committee is currently undertaking a bed capacity review for mental health beds across the whole country.  It is looking at acute and community services, including the community houses to which I referred, to determine how we are fixed in that regard.  It is also looking at forensic mental health services in the context of our prisons and the facility at Portrane.<\/p>  <p>  A commitment has been given by the HSE that mental health support services will always be provided on the Owenacurra site, which is massive.  We know that the building is not fit for purpose and that the residents have to leave.  As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, what I do not want is that the only possibility for people is ending up in a long-term residential care facility.  That is what I do not want.  I want people to have the supports they need.  There will be a range of people who want to live in supported housing with the correct wraparound supports.  That does not mean that they will have somebody 24-7 but that they will have the correct wraparound supports, as determined by the individual.  There are people living like that within the community.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Stanton asked about a 24-hour staffed service which is only available in Cork and Dublin through mental health crisis resolution teams.  There are only two such teams in the whole country.  I can only assume that is what Deputy Stanton is referring to, but I will check that out and revert back to the Deputy.  <\/p>  <p>  I want to make sure that the residents of Owenacurra have the best possible outcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120700063#LLL00300","speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1638919800,"counter":537,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at at 10.57 p.m until 9.12 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 December 2021.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
