I am delighted to be here to introduce the Central Mental Hospital (Relocation) Bill 2020 to the House.  The Central Mental Hospital operates from a building in Dundrum that dates back to 1850.  That building is no longer fit for purpose.  Construction of a new hospital is a long-standing Government policy and a priority in the programme for Government.  A significant and historic development will occur in 2021 with the opening of the new national forensic mental health campus in Portrane, County Dublin.  This campus comprises three psychiatric centres, including a new state-of-the-art central mental hospital to replace the Dundrum hospital.  However, legislation is needed to relocate the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum to Portrane.<\/p> <p>For 170 years, the Central Mental Hospital has provided secure care, specialist treatment and rehabilitation for people at high, medium and pre-discharge levels of security.  Currently, it is providing inpatient treatment to 94 people.  Most of these are detained under various provisions of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, with smaller numbers under the Mental Health Act 2001 as well as a small number of people who are wards of court.<\/p> <p>The hospital was built on a parkland site because the Victorians believed that people with mental ill health could benefit from space and nature.  That belief was a progressive one and more enlightened than the facility's name, which was a product of its time.  Today, the language of that time is inappropriate, outdated, and offensive.  Unfortunately, as some of it is written in law, I will need to quote from it at times during this debate.<\/p> <p>In that context, I note that the current legal definition of the Central Mental Hospital comes from the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum (Ireland) Act 1845.  That Act provided for what was defined as a criminal lunatic asylum to be built.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It was constructed in Dundrum and later, under the Mental Treatment Act 1961, renamed the Central Mental Hospital.  The provisions of those two Acts are what combine to link the hospital to its current location in Dundrum.  This Bill is needed to allow the hospital to operate from a new location.<\/p><p>The Bill is short and technical.  Its purpose is to provide a lawful basis for the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital from Dundrum, County Dublin, to a new facility at Portrane, County Dublin.  It also provides for the transfer of persons detained in Dundrum to Portrane and provides for an ongoing lawful basis for their detention.  It provides for the closure of the Dundrum facility and repeal of section 39 of the Mental Treatment Act 1961 which links the Central Mental Hospital to the location in Dundrum.<\/p><p>I will now take the House through the Bill to clarify its provisions.  Section 1 deals with definitions.  It defines the meanings of some of the terms used for the purposes of the Bill, including \"relocation day\", \"closure day\" and \"former Central Mental Hospital\".<\/p><p>Section 2 sets out procedures for fixing a date by ministerial order for the relocation of the hospital.  The date shall be agreed after consultation with the Minister for Justice and the Mental Health Commission.  From the relocation day, the new hospital in Portrane shall be known as the Central Mental Hospital.  A copy of a map marking the location of the new hospital will be included in the ministerial order, with the original map deposited in the Department of Health.  From the relocation day, references to the \"Central Mental Hospital\" or \"Central Mental Hospital Dundrum\" in any enactment, court order or other document made before the relocation day will be read as meaning the new hospital.  <\/p><p>Section 3 provides that persons who are lawfully detained in Dundrum before the relocation day will continue to be lawfully detained in Dundrum on and after the relocation day, pending their transfer to Portrane.  During the transitional period between the relocation day and the closure of the Dundrum facility, persons lawfully detained in Dundrum will be transferred to Portrane and will continue to be lawfully detained during that transfer.  The specific provisions under which persons may be lawfully detained in the Central Mental Hospital are included in this section.  They are: section 202 of the Defence Act 1954, where a person is unfit to stand trial by court martial; section 203 of the Defence Act 1954, where a person has been found guilty of an offence at a trial by court martial but was, as defined by the legislation, insane at the time of the offence; section 14 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for the involuntary admission of a patient suffering from a mental disorder for his or her reception, detention and treatment; section 15 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for the period of involuntary admission of a patient to be extended; section 21 of the Mental Health Act 2001, which allows for a patient detained in another approved psychiatric centre to be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital either for his or her benefit or for the purpose of obtaining special treatment; section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows the detention of a person who is accused of an offence, is suffering from a mental disorder, is in need of inpatient care or treatment for that disorder, and is not fit to stand trial; section 5 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows the detention of a person who has been held to be not guilty of an offence by reason of insanity, is suffering from a mental disorder and needs inpatient care or treatment for that disorder; and section 15 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, which allows that a person who is detained in a prison and suffering from a mental disorder for which he or she cannot be afforded appropriate care or treatment within the prison can be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital to receive care or treatment for the mental disorder.<\/p><p>Section 4 sets out procedures for fixing a date by ministerial order for the closure of the Dundrum facility as a psychiatric centre.  This date will be no later than the relocation day made under section 2.  The date shall be agreed after consultation with the Minister for Justice and the Mental Health Commission.<\/p><p>Section 5 confirms that several existing entitlements for people detained under the Mental Health Act 2001 and the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 are unaffected by the changes in the Bill.  These are entitlements for persons to have their detention reviewed, to appeal against it, to have their detention revoked where appropriate, or transferred from the Central Mental Hospital.<\/p><p>Section 6 allows approved expenses associated with the administration of the Bill to be paid for from public funds.  Section 7 repeals section 39 of the Mental Treatment Act 1961.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That section renamed the building commissioned in Dundrum under the 1845 Act as the Central Mental Hospital.

This Bill raises some issues which might be surprising in one respect.  The new facility in Portrane is almost finished or will be ready for commissioning very soon.  It would be nonsense, therefore, not to provide for the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital to the site.  I fully appreciate that point but I will make a couple of points.<\/p> <p>This Bill is being introduced to this House now when the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum has effectively been prepared for closure and the arrangements for its reopening in Portrane have been advanced almost to completion.  The issue that occurs to me is whether it is a wise strategy that is coming to an end.  The Central Mental Hospital was established, as the Minister of State said, in the 19th century.  I had the opportunity to visit it when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I will come back to that later, if I may.  The Central Mental Hospital has a number of functions, including the one in the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to which the Minister of State referred.  I was responsible for seeing that legislation through these Houses.  One of the provisions of the Act was that prisoners who were suffering from psychiatric disorders and mental illness could be moved in certain circumstances from prisons to the Central Mental Hospital for inpatient treatment.  That is the theory but the fact of it is quite different.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Unfortunately, the Central Mental Hospital is not in a position to deal with the level of psychiatric illness in our prisons.  It is by no means in a position to do that, and it is not philosophically oriented towards doing that.  The hospital has been under the tutelage of Professor Kennedy for more than 21 years, and the tradition has been one of fairly small contact with the day-to-day psychiatric needs of prisoners.  It does operate consultancy services within our prisons, but they are wholly inadequate to deal with the levels of mental illness in our prisons and they have been repeatedly criticised by the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Council of Europe's Committee on the Prevention of Torture.<\/p><p>When I became Minister for justice in 2002, one of the first things I did that summer was to visit Mountjoy Prison, and one of the first things I saw there was a padded cell.  I will now describe the cell for those in the House.  It was about the size of a horse stall.  Its walls and floor had brown rubber mats on them, there was a pink light hanging from around eight feet above, shining down, and there was no daylight in the cell whatsoever.  The only supervisory access to it was through a peephole in the door.  I asked to see the cell because I was aware of the condemnation of the Irish padded cell situation that existed at the time.  When the door was opened, I discovered a prisoner in his underpants with a blanket or towel lying on the floor in the foetal position with a plastic potty beside him, in almost complete darkness.  I was so horrified and taken aback by what I saw that day, that I immediately told the Irish Prison Service that the situation had to change and we could stand over it no longer.  With the Government's backing, in December of that year, we announced plans to scrap padded cells and replace them with facilities for at-risk prisoners called observation cells, with much more daylight and windows in them.  <\/p><p>That was the beginning of my hands-on experience of how prisoners with psychiatric and mental health problems were dealt with in the Irish Prison Service.  To say that that was the beginning of a history of involvement is an understatement.  As Minister, I had almost constant interaction with the Committee on the Prevention of Torture, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and similar organisations on the problems that arose.  I had almost constant involvement with these organisations and with other people - and I hope to come back to this later in the debate on this Bill - right up to the point where a prisoner, Gary Douche, ended up being murdered in a basement collective cell block with 13 other prisoners, in circumstances, again, where a prisoner who was mentally ill, was afforded access to him.  I want to set that scene for Members because there are other remarks that I would like to make on this Bill and the approach of the Irish State to the treatment of mentally ill prisoners, and prisoners suffering from psychiatric disorders, which I think needs a radically different approach from that set out in this Bill, as good as the progress reflected in this Bill actually is.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#D00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.

This development has been happening quietly in recent years, with the support of all parties, to do the right thing by people who suffer from mental challenges.  I fully agree with Senator McDowell that it probably is not big enough and that it probably does not provide enough supports, but it is certainly a great start.  It has been going on for a long time.  Certainly, quarter 1 of 2021 will be a giant leap forward in how we view people who find themselves in these circumstances, which would be welcomed by everybody.<\/p><p>I listened with great interest to Senator McDowell when he was a Minister in regard to the issue of padded cells.  I had not realised that he was the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who ordered that their use should cease and who got the support of the Government at the time.  That was significant and it was always going to influence his opinions and how he would move forward in this area.  That is good, because personal experience and seeing something like that at first hand would, of course, have an impact on how he would chart his commitment to that going forward.<\/p><p>I served on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality with Senator Bacik for a number of years.  We went to see many facilities, including Mountjoy Prison, Cork Prison and others.  This House has highlighted issues in this area and we have seen some incremental success.  The mental capacity legislation that was before the Oireachtas between 2011 and 2016, ground-breaking as it was at the time, was intended to do exactly what the Minister of State spoke about, that is, to address the language used.  Language is important.  The old phrase \"sticks and stones may break our bones but names will never hurt us\" is not true, of course.<\/p><p>As for the language in the various items of legislation, which go back to the 1800s, I do not know whether we can create some omnibus legislation to change the language.  Even if we just change the language, it would be appropriate.  The Minister of State had no choice but to read those terms into the record of the House because that is the legislative framework she is working from.  We should strive to change it.  Hopefully, there will now be a period of government for the next three or four years, where matters such as this can be addressed.  It could not have been done by the previous Government because there was a question as to how long it would last.  All that was ever dealt with was legislation that was deemed a priority, with the exception of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017, but we will not go there.  The language needs to be tidied up and it would be appropriate to do so.<\/p><p>What is the intention for the building in Dundrum?  What use does the HSE plan to make of the building?  I have never visited it but I believe it is a highly valuable site.  Are there plans to dispose of it on the open market or will other uses be made of it from a health or justice perspective?  Overall, the Bill is a good development.  I am a member of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  A visit to the new forensic mental health campus would be in order, just to see at first hand exactly what is being done and what the plans are for caring for vulnerable people in our society.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Martin Conway:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Senator McDowell gave an example of a visit to a facility to get an understanding of it when he spoke about his trip to a prison, where he saw a padded cell.

As Senator Conway said, she is now a very regular visitor.  On behalf of the Labour Party group of Senators, I welcome the Bill.  We will certainly support it.  It is long overdue.  As the Minister of State has said, the Central Mental Hospital is no longer fit for purpose and we support this move.  We appreciate the urgency involved in the move although it raises the question of the exact timeframe involved.  There have been quite a number of slippages.  This move was to have been achieved by the last quarter of 2020.  Covid has clearly had an impact on that timeframe, but it would be good to hear what the Minister of State has to say about the precise timing for the move.  I know that Senator McDowell has tabled amendments on that issue.<\/p><p>I echo Senator McDowell's criticism of our treatment of persons with psychiatric illness both within our prisons and within the State in general.  I will say a little more about that.  This move is long overdue.  It is very important that we see the new national forensic mental health campus in Portrane open but, even when it is open, we will still only have 170 beds available.  I believe the Central Mental Hospital's capacity is 102 and this will be increased to 170.  This will increase our number of secure forensic beds per 100,000 of population from 2 to 3.5.  Most EU states have ten such beds per 100,000 so our capacity will still be only a third of that of most EU states.  One international peer-reviewed journal published a study last year which found that Ireland was at the bottom of a table of 16 EU member states with regard to forensic bed capacity per head of population.  That is a serious concern.<\/p><p>I also share Senator McDowell's concerns about the extent to which people with psychiatric issues are currently being detained within prisons where, in many cases, they cannot get access to the services they need.  I am indebted to Mr. Cormac O'Keeffe of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>who wrote a piece in August in which he interviewed Professor Harry Kennedy, the long-standing director of the Central Mental Hospital.  This piece also drew from some of the testimony which Professor Kennedy and others had given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care.  The piece pointed out the very significant issue that the caseload of the national forensic mental health service in respect of in-reach programmes in prison was 250.  That is a massive number of people who are detained in prisons and who require specialist psychiatric services.  Professor Kennedy is quoted as saying Cloverhill Prison &quot;is the trolley system for psychiatry&quot;, that is to say, it is like a sort of accident and emergency department waiting area where people are left on trolleys waiting for the treatment they require.  That is terrible.  It is an indictment of our criminal justice system.  <\/p><p>In January 2019, the director general of the Irish Prison Service told the Committee of Public Accounts that &quot;at any one time within our service we have between 20 and 30 prisoners on the waiting list for the Central Mental Hospital.&quot;  This is a serious matter.  Despite the fact that section 15 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 allows persons to be transferred to the Central Mental Hospital to receive care or treatment for a mental disorder, the cap on numbers and the limited supply of places available have prevented many people from getting the treatment they require.  The director of the Central Mental Hospital, Professor Kennedy, has said that, even with the increase in capacity from 102 places to 170 following the move to Portrane, the new facility will be full within a very short space of time.  That is a real concern.<\/p><p>I will also raise a couple of other concerns.  The Minister of State has quite rightly pointed out that the language used with regard to psychiatric illness in our criminal law statutes is extremely outdated.  As recently as 2006, we brought in major statutory reform through the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 but, unfortunately, even in the Title of this Act, we still used the outdated term, &quot;insanity&quot;.  By contrast, our mental treatment legislation refers to such psychiatric illnesses in more modern and contemporary terms.  The term &quot;insanity&quot; no longer has a place in modern language.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I urge the Minister of State to take steps to change that.  I raised this at the time we brought forward some amending legislation to the 2006 Act and it needs to be said again.  <\/p><p>In addition, this Bill, although it is technical and very welcome, raises the broader question of our treatment of prisoners.  Senator Conway referred to the time he and I spent on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  He will recall that he was a colleague on the committee when we published an extensive report on penal reform in 2013 in which we called for the implementation of a policy of prison only as a last resort and for a move away from the imposition of short custodial sentences for non-violent offenders.  We were conscious that all the expert evidence pointed to an over-reliance on imprisonment in our system for minor offenders, who should be diverted.  I convened an all-party penal reform group in the Oireachtas in the previous term and we brought in Professor Harry Kennedy to talk about very important and enlightened diversion programmes that divert those with psychiatric illness from the criminal justice system and imprisonment and into care and psychiatric treatment that are more community-based.  We have a real issue with our prison system more generally.  Interestingly, Mountjoy Prison, like the Central Mental Hospital, was built in 1850 and has similarly outdated structures.  Great improvements have undoubtedly been made internally but we have seen the long fingering of any larger reform and reconstruction.  This Bill gives us an opportunity to speak about a more enlightened, humane and progressive penal system, not just for those with psychiatric illness within our penal system but all of those who are incarcerated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#G00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I begin by welcoming the Minister of State.  Senator Bacik made an important point.  Having a facility like this is important.  I know that concerns have been raised with the Minister this morning and previously in the D&aacute;il.  Inasmuch as having a facility and resource is welcome and a step forward, we must be careful that we do not think for one second that it absolves the Prison Service of its responsibilities because not every mental health or psychological issue warrants a move to a facility like this.  For this reason, a watching brief must be kept on the Prison Service regarding how it adapts, implements and enacts a very progressive, modern and patient-centred approach to those facing psychological and mental health challenges within the prison system.<\/p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill.  I know my colleagues in the D&aacute;il expressed their views on it to the Minister of State.  I agree with Senator Conway that this is a significant site that has become available.  There will be different views about how it should be utilised but certainly in the midst of a housing crisis, it would be useful to consider how we use and develop the site in a way that helps us address that crisis.  Questions have also been raised here and earlier in the process about resourcing this new facility.  Some of the concerns about how we do that have been flagged and I do not need to repeat them all this afternoon.  I do not think any of the points raised by Senator McDowell take away from this but there are some very legitimate concerns about how this facility will be resourced.  It has been a good debate thus far.  It is important legislation.  It is very technical in nature, as has been noted already, but it is certainly needed.  We need to do our bit and ensure it gets through this House as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#H00200","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I join other Senators in welcoming the Minister of State to the House.  I will never lose an opportunity like this to talk about the mental health of people who come from prisons into the Central Mental Hospital.  I know something of the Central Mental Hospital as it is located in the former administrative area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member for many years.  It is important in this ongoing debate about the Central Mental Hospital to make clear that it is a hospital, not a prison.  That is a fundamental distinction to make about this place.  We know that historically there have been issues.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In preparing for today's debate, I came across an informative piece by Paul Cullen from <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which referred to major abuses in terms of the facility and detention.  In one case, a person was there in excess of 100 hours.  I, too, served on the visiting committee for St. Patrick's Institution, which used to be next door to Mountjoy Prison.  I experienced what my colleague, Senator McDowell, spoke about such as padded cells and issues around mental health.  These were children, predominantly 16-year-olds to 18-year-olds, many of whom sought to go into these cells voluntarily because of the difficulties and issues they had.  Again, it was the same square box with the same eye in the wall.<br\/><br\/>The Central Mental Hospital site is 13.4 ha and is an exceptionally valuable site.  It is peppered with several unique protected structures which are a challenge in any redevelopment.  We know the Land Development Agency has made claim to it.  There are arrangements that it will build out this facility, a plan well-established with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is a plan for the site but the issue is the costs involved.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State will note from various Ministers in the previous Administration - I circulated some newsletters today to some of my colleagues about this - that they announced that this money would be 100% ring-fenced for mental health services.  The Minister of State has a huge commitment to mental health.  I hope she will continue strongly to endorse that commitment to the money which will be transferred ultimately from the sale of this unique site.  If the Land Development Agency gets its plan, it is proposed to be a mixed use site with social, affordable, rent-to-buy along with the sale of private houses.  It is well documented and there is no big secret about what is being proposed.  The Government, in principle, supports the idea.  The site is serviced by good public transport.  We need to ring-fence a substantial amount of the money around the asset of this premises for the development of a new facility in Portrane.<br\/><br\/>I followed up with the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, which estimates there is requirement for an additional 200 staff in this new facility and recruitment needs to start.  Are we serious if we are talking about opening this facility in three months?  I understand there is also an issue about the cost running into millions of euro to fit out this new facility.  This facility is far from ready yet.  We would be lucky and ambitious if we could get this transfer completed within the next few months.  There are questions as to where that money is coming from.  The PNA stated there is a requirement for more than 200 additional nurses, which Senator Clifford-Lee said is a welcome move.  We need to have plans.I would like to hear the Minister of State tell us what will happen in terms of the staffing for this 120-bed forensic hospital.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of dignity and respect of the patients at this facility.  It is important their human rights, dignity and respect are protected.  There have been breaches in the past.  We have learned an awful lot relating to the incarceration of people with special needs.  It is an important point of which we must never lose sight.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge the good work of the mental health tribunals which meets the patients and their advocates.  Their advocates are the eyes and ears in terms of rights and respect in and around mental health issues and the challenges that come with these.  It is important we acknowledge their particular good work.<br\/><br\/>What are the costs involved in the project?  How can we ring-fence and stay online with the commitment for this money to go into mental health services, particularly with the Prison Service?  More importantly, I would like to have more detail on a proactive recruitment drive to put in place the necessary psychiatric and support staff necessary for this new facility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#H00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":37,"content":"<p>There are quite a lot of questions and I will do my best to get through them as best I can.<\/p> <p>I knew this legislation was coming and have heard a lot about it since I took up my position on 1 July.  Six weeks ago and before we went back into lockdown, I took the opportunity to visit both sites.  I first visited the Dundrum facility where I met Professor Kennedy and some of his team.  Due to Covid restrictions I was unable to see where some inmates, residents or detainees are detained but I saw quite a lot and spoke to some of the people who work there.

It must be a wonderful place to live because on the day of my visit the sun shone and the views were spectacular.  I was extremely impressed by what I saw on my visit to what will be the new central mental hospital.  The project is long overdue and the additional capacity is very welcome.<\/p> <p>Many issues have been raised with regard to capacity.  Senator Bacik is right that the capacity of the Central Mental Hospital was 102 in 2019 but is only 93 at the moment due to Covid.  A certain number of isolation rooms had to be kept in case there was a major outbreak.  The new state-of-the-art facility in Portrane is at an advanced stage of construction and is expected to open in the first half of 2021.  I admit that there has been some slippage because of Covid.  We only have an approximate relocation date.  When I visited the site six weeks ago, the builders had reached the snagging stage and the project was approximately 98% complete.  The project will be handed over in the new year.  It will take approximately three months to equip, commission and train staff.  <\/p> <p>There will 130 new beds in the new facility: a high-security unit with 40 beds; an intellectual disability unit with 20 beds; a medium secure unit with 30 beds; a pre-discharge unit with 20 beds; and a female unit with 20 beds.  There will be 30 beds in the forensic intensive care and rehabilitation unit and ten beds in the forensic child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, unit.  I saw the CAMHS unit and was very impressed.<\/p> <p>I welcome the fact that, in 2002, Senator McDowell was to the fore in making sure that we no longer had padded cells and now have observation cells.  The CAMHS unit is for youths and minors aged under 18 years who are very challenged and have probably come through the courts system but would not have been fit to stand trial.  On my visit I was very impressed with the way the CAMHS unit was set out with individual rooms, green areas, sports areas and well-lit areas with high ceilings that improved the acoustics.  The facilities are state-of-the art.  I believe that when Covid passes the facilities are well worth a visit, especially for members of the health and justice committees, which have done so much work on these issues.  However, I do not know whether a visit by the committees is possible.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many people have said that we will still have capacity issues in years to come.  As I said, we are increasing from 102 places to 170 places.  Will it address the waiting list?  It will, to some extent.  It will increase capacity at the new campus but will not entirely keep pace with the trends in demand for places.  It would be incorrect for me to say that it would.  It will, however, certainly make a difference in the short term.<\/p><p>Improved forensic bed capacity is envisaged under phase 2 of this capital project, which provides for the two new 30-bed regional intensive care units in Cork and Galway under the multiannual HSE capital plan.  This will be another 60 beds.<\/p><p>As Members are aware, Sharing the Vision is a ten-year programme for implementing a proper mental health service for all people.  One in four of us will have a mental health illness at some stage in our lives.  The majority of us will go to our GPs and get the help and supports we need.  There are quite a lot of people, however, for whom that is not enough.  They will need supports.  Sharing the Vision is a person-centred approach.  Last Friday we held the first meeting of the national implementation and monitoring committee, which is chaired by John Saunders of the Mental Health Commission.  It is an independent committee.  After the first meeting last Friday I was delighted and impressed that we have so many people with experience of working with mental health issues, and so many people who are positive about affecting change, who are all part of that committee.  The committee comprises 15 or 16 people.  There are also 30 to 40 people who have shown an interest and there will be three or four sub-committees put in place immediately in January 2021.  One will be on the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and our waiting lists, and the other committee I want to see in place immediately will look at capacity for all mental health beds throughout the country, and not only at community level.  It will be at all levels to see where we are going because we must plan for the future.  Certainly, the extra beds being provided at this new facility will make a huge difference.<\/p><p>Senator McDowell raised many issues with regard to the justice system.  The Government is committed to delivering on the acute and complex needs of people with mental health difficulties interacting with the criminal justice sector.  The Department of Justice, in communication with the Department of Health, is in the process of establishing the cross-level, cross-departmental and cross-agency task force.  The Senator is quite right that mental health cannot be less than health.  It must come across all the different Departments in relation to justice, housing and social protection.  We have had the first meeting.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and I have all attended.  We are at the early stages of setting up this high-level, cross-departmental and cross-agency task force.  Under the prisons and penal reform heading in the programme for Government it is envisaged to improve links between health and judicial systems.  This will examine the mental health and addiction challenges of those imprisoned and in primary care support on release.<\/p><p>Many questions were asked about the future plans for the Dundrum site.  The site is owned by the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland.  An 11.3 ha. Dundrum central development is to be located on the site of the former Central Mental Hospital after it relocates to Portrane.  This will be progressed by the Land Development Agency, which is a commercial State-sponsored body set up to co-ordinate land within State control for more optimal uses where appropriate and with a focus on the provision of housing.  A planning application for the Dundrum site is expected to be submitted in mid-2021 with construction to start in 2022, subject to planning approval.  While the residential unit mix, number and ancillary uses will be determined as part of the design, a development of approximately 1,300 new build residential units, including reuse of the heritage building on the site is proposed.  The Land Development Agency will engage in a consultation with the public and community groups on the scheme.<\/p><p>On Senator Boyhan's point, the site is being transferred into the Land Development Agency for the construction of housing.  A commitment was given some years ago that profits from the sale of former mental health facilities would be refreshed into mental health services.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I think this is the point Senator Boyhan is making.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#K00300","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":42,"content":"<p>It was to be ring-fenced.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#M00200","speaker":"1634"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":43,"content":"<p>The Dundrum site is not being sold but transferred to a State-sponsored body for the purpose of increasing housing capacity, but I will certainly follow up on the point made by the Senator.

This amendment and the other amendments in my name and the name of Senator Boyhan are to try to put firm dates on the process of transfer.<\/p> <p>I want to expand the point.  The Minister of State recently visited Dundrum.  She did not see the interior of the old building for various reasons.  I went to visit it when I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  My purpose was to do effectively what the Minister of State was doing.  It was to see the site and to see what could be done with it.  At that time, the Minister for Health and Children and T&aacute;naiste was Ms Mary Harney.  She had gone to Dundrum and said it was worse inside than her worst nightmare.  Things may have improved a little but the building was rather antiquated.<\/p> <p>I want the House to know this for the record.  When I arrived there, I was shown around the campus, in which there was a new section.  As I was shown through the new section I saw a gym.  Some of the psychiatric nurses were practising judo and all sorts of things in the gym.  I went down a corridor.  There was a series of modern cells.  The thing that struck me about them was that there were rolled up mattresses on the beds and they were not occupied.  Eventually, I got to the Victorian block.  When I got to the Victorian block, I was greeted by the management of the Central Mental Hospital, given my tea and biscuits and asked to do a tour of the remainder of the premises, which I did.  I agree with the Minister of State completely that the grounds are magnificent.  In fact, the current director, Dr. Kennedy, says that the gardeners are artists.  The grounds are magnificent.  Yet, nothing prepared me for what was in the Victorian block.  Even though it looks an impressive building from the outside, in fact it was configured by depressing cells with little windows 8 ft or 10 ft from the floor.  There were no facilities whatsoever, not even a television.  Having gone around the other prisons in the prison system, it struck me as extraordinary that inmates in Dundrum could not have access in their cells to television.  As I was walking up and down the stairs I noticed that someone had helpfully and thoughtfully laid out a carpet of paint flakes that had been swept down from the ceilings of the premises to impress on me the decrepit state of the premises.<\/p> <p>All of that is part of this process.  The reason I went there that day and the reason the then T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, went there was to see what we could do about all the critical reports from the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the Irish Penal Reform Trust.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The problem, as the Minister of State said, is that responsibility for mental illness in the criminal justice system is not, and cannot, be confined simply to one Department.  If, however, my Cabinet colleague and I shared the ministerial responsibility, we would have a shared responsibility to make sure that something was done about it.  It was in that context that the proposal was made to sell Shanganagh Castle in south Dublin.  Part of it was sold for &euro;9 million to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and part of it for &euro;21 million to a private developer.  That &euro;30 million was eventually used to purchase the Thornton Hall lands.  The House will probably recall that there was controversy about that because of the price that was paid, but the process was such that we had no compulsory purchase order rights.  It was very difficult to get anybody to give us any property in the county of Dublin on which a jail could be erected.  The plan was to redevelop the Mountjoy site, the plans for which were put in place.  At that time, the management of Mountjoy indicated that it was not even possible economically to put toilets into cells there.  It was in that context that the decision was made to have a new campus at Thornton Hall.  It was anticipated at that time, and Professor Kennedy has acknowledged this, that his facility would be located at one end of that site, with its own entrance into it, but that it would be much closer to Dublin's main prison.<\/p><p>The economic crash took place in 2008 and 2009 and Thornton Hall was stalled.  A review group was set up by the former Minister, Alan Shatter, as to what should happen with Thornton Hall.  It comprised a number of people, including Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, retired Supreme Court judge.  They reported that the project at Thornton Hall should go ahead but, needless to say, in 2011 they said it should go ahead on a less ambitious basis than had previously been planned.  We had believed, however, and the then Government had believed, that there would be at least &euro;200 million or &euro;250 million out of the sale of Mountjoy Prison and the hospital in Dundrum to finance a state-of-the-art set of prison institutions of varying degrees, from high security to low security, with prison grounds and remedial facilities attached to them.  We had also believed that prisoners' mental health would be accommodated in this respect.  The Minister of State has fairly conceded, as has Professor Kennedy, that the 170 places will probably fill up very soon when this is all dealt with, but it is not good enough just to say that, and I do not say this critically of the Minister of State.  It is not good enough for the State to say it has reached 170 because of the figures Senator Bacik mentioned in respect of our shocking underinvestment in mental illness among the prison population compared with any other state in the EU.  We invest a third or a quarter of the average.  This has gone on for 30 years, since the term, \"criminal lunatic asylum\", was abolished.  We have done it consistently.<\/p><p>The point I wish to make is this: at present in Cloverhill Prison, a wing, D2, is being used effectively as a psychiatric ward for difficult prisoners.  It is wholly unsuitable for that purpose, and prisoners who are detained in that wing are there under the management.  I am not criticising any prison officer or staff at all.  The prisoners are not there under decent clinical supervision.  They are not being treated with a view to their overcoming their condition.  They are being contained in that place.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I presume the Minister of State will agree that if a person suffering from psychosis, schizophrenia, massive addiction problems or other personality problems such as manic depression and the like is kept in an area with similar people in prison circumstances, the chances of giving that person decent remedial treatment are small.  Professor Kennedy stated that this regime is ridiculous because if the person is given even anti-depressant tablets, Diazepam or another medication, on return to the cell the person is bulled into giving the medication to other prisoners who wish to use it to accommodate their own addiction problems and the like.  What I am really saying is that what the Minister of State is doing through the Bill is good, but it is certainly not good enough.<\/p><p>If there is any doubt about that, I ask the House to consider the commission of investigation conducted by Grainne McMorrow, senior counsel, into the death of Gary Douch.  I have the report before me.  He was a prisoner in Mountjoy Prison.  He was apprehensive about his security in the particular place he was in Mountjoy Prison and asked to be transferred out of it for his own safety.  Horrifically, he was put into a communal cell in B base block in Mountjoy Prison with 12 other people who were being accommodated overnight there.  They included several prisoners who had been transferred from Cloverhill Prison.  Among them was a prisoner named Stephen Egan.  It is all in the report, so I do not think I am doing any injustice by naming him.  He was suffering major psychiatric illness, as the report states.  What is horrific is that he had been suffering from very serious psychiatric illness and earlier that year was sent to the Central Mental Hospital but then certified fit to go back into the prison system.  He was found to be too difficult to manage by the institutions to which he was sent back and there was a reluctance to have him.  Eventually, in a moment of extreme carelessness, he was admitted to Mountjoy Prison without any of his drugs or charts being put into that room.  In the course of the evening, he killed Gary Douch.  He was eventually found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to imprisonment for life, which is a very severe punishment for that offence.<\/p><p>I really do recommend that report to all present.  It did not receive significant publicity at the time.  It details just how inadequate was the response to the crisis in this man's incarceration, treatment and mental illness.  It is a very severe report in some respects because it actually lays a charge of personal responsibility at the then governors of Cloverhill and Mountjoy prisons, whom I will not name.  They were named in the report as people bearing a significant responsibility for what happened on that occasion.  This all happened in 2006.  At the time, I was very conscious that Dermot Kinlen, the then Inspector of Prisons, had condemned the use of this cell facility in Mountjoy but his words were not heeded by the management of the prison.  It was in those circumstances that the commission of investigation to which I refer was established. <\/p><p>All of this leads me to believe that prisoners who are suffering from a psychiatric illness or a mental illness must be treated in a radically different way from that in which they are treated now.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->They must be given remedial accommodation and expert, full-time medical supervision.  They cannot be ferried in and out of the prison system.  The strange thing about the Stephen Egan case is that he had gone to the CMH suffering from acute disorders but had been certified by the CMH as being fit to go back to the prison system.  The clinical director's certificate avers that a consultation took place and he was found to be &quot;fit&quot; to return to prison.  What is really shocking is that shortly after he returned to Mountjoy, external solicitors for the prisoner engaged their own consultant psychiatrist.  The report stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tOn 26th July 2006 however &ndash; three days before his transfer from Cloverhill to Mountjoy Prison &ndash; Mr Egan was seen by an external senior clinical psychologist at the request of Mr Egan&rsquo;s solicitors.  This senior consultant clinical psychologist had been asked to interview Mr Egan and to prepare a report in anticipation of a sentencing hearing on 27th July 2006. [Mr. Egan was due to be sentenced for another offence] He had no prior knowledge of Mr Egan&rsquo;s history as a troublesome prisoner with a propensity for violence.  Nor was he aware of Mr Egan&rsquo;s history of mental health problems, or of his recent sojourn in the Central Mental Hospital.  Mr Egan was brought down to a regular visiting area for this interview.  <\/blockquote><p>The consultant said that when he met this prisoner, he found him to be &quot;manic&quot;, &quot;completely deluded&quot; and &quot;very unwell&quot;.  This was approximately five days before poor Mr. Douch was killed in that prison cell.  <br\/><br\/>The Gr&aacute;inne McMorrow report quoted above details the completely dysfunctional relationship between the prison system at the time, the particular institutions in that system and the CMH.  I am not here to point fingers or to hand out blame in retrospect.  Although the McMorrow report was commissioned when I was Minister, it was not published until many years later.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to put two points on the record.  First, I strongly believe that we must build Thornton Hall because Mountjoy is not adequate as a prison and never will be.  We have the site, we have done the ground work and we must build it.  The review group which included Ms Justice McGuinness also came to the conclusion that the site should be used for a prison.  That is not my point to justify all of that.  Second, the Department of Health is exercising supervision over a small institution at Dundrum which has between 98 and 102 places and I am sure it is doing that very conscientiously.  The Department of Justice is presiding over a prison system as best it can, where access to acute psychiatric treatment for ill prisoners is virtually non-existent.  The Department of Justice cannot just put prisoners in a van, send them up to Dundrum, say that they have gone completely off the rails, need urgent inpatient treatment now and cannot be accommodated in the prison system.  I hope the Minister of State does not mind me saying that today's Bill shows what happens when we govern in silos.  We get a relocation of the CMH from Dundrum to Portrane and a significant but not adequate improvement in the resources that the CMH will have in future.  However, looking systemically at how people in the Irish criminal justice system are dealt with, we find that there is practically nothing of significance being done by this legislation to deal with that situation.  That said, I take the Minister of State's assurances that the Government is intent on doing this.<br\/><br\/>The Land Development Agency to which the Minister of State referred in her remarks is now going to deal with the OPW land and develop it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I mentioned earlier that Shanganagh Castle was disposed of to finance the Thornton Hall site.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council sat on that land, or part of it, until very recently.  I notice that in November the elected members of the council were asked to make a section 183 decision to vest the land in the Land Development Agency and a presentation was made to them for that purpose.<\/p><p>It is extraordinary that in the middle of a housing crisis it took 15 or 16 years for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to do anything with that land.  The same could be said about Thornton Hall.  It is sitting there and it is ready to be developed as a prison.  Mountjoy needs to be developed.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach might be interested to know the Mountjoy campus was extended by the acquisition of land to the side so it could be commercially redeveloped.  Consultant architects were brought in with very elaborate plans for a major urban residential quarter to be built on the site.  I fully accept the economic collapse of 2007 to 2009, inclusive, made this impossible but such projects are becoming possible again.  The Dundrum, Shanganagh and Mountjoy sites are now available if the Government wants to be proactive in ensuring facilities are built.<\/p><p>I urge the House not to think we have solved all the problems with today's Bill and the relocation, good as it is, to the beautiful peninsula at Portmarnock.  We have not.  There is a massive problem out there that is not addressed, and it is how we deal with people who end up in prison.  Professor Harry Kennedy, in one of his reports, indicated that people with mental illness end up in jail because they smash the window of a shop or pub in a psychotic moment.  District judges find themselves in a position where they can hardly do anything with such people but send them to jail because if they let them out on the street they do not know what calamity might occur as soon as they leave the courthouse.  It is jail or nothing.  The hope is that something could be done for such people when they are put in prison.  If a person smashes a window, wrecks a pub or throws a brick at somebody, he or she probably does not go to the Central Mental Hospital at all.  It is not the normal route and only a small number of people end up there for such tiny matters.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to ensure the committee she mentions, a cross-departmental committee on mental illness, would address the criminal justice system as a matter of absolute priority.  There are many other concerns, such as residential accommodation in the community and different approaches to the treatment of people suffering mental disability and the like, but there is no chance of prison having any remedial effect if it is populated by untreated people suffering mental illness.  People do not speak about being fair to prisoners that often but it is very unfair on a prisoner to have to share accommodation and food with people suffering serious untreated mental illness and liable to become violent or whatever.  It is depressing for people suffering from no mental disorder to have to share the same facilities, corridors or open spaces within prisons with people who are clearly unsuited to being confined in those institutions.<\/p><p>It is a systemic matter.  What we have not done has been roundly condemned by the committee for the prevention of torture internationally.  The committee stated said the Portrane proposal is an improvement.  It does not comprise unreasonable people.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know from the figures that Senator Bacik has mentioned that we are only doing a tiny fraction of what we should be doing and this will have consequences, as in the case of Gary Douch and Stephen Egan.  These situations have consequences that may not be as horrific as in that particular case but they impinge on the well-being of everybody whom we send to prison.  It is time for the Government to grasp the nettle, get on with doing what the group, including Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, recommended, and that is building decent prison facilities and getting out of Mountjoy Prison.<\/p><p>I want to make another point in case what I have said appears to be critical of Mountjoy Prison.  The then governor was personally attached with responsibility for what happened but since then there have been good governors there who deserve our absolute praise for what they have done.  Senator Bacik referred to the fact that the prison is immensely better than what it used to be.  Governors Whelan, Mullen and Murphy have done immense work to transform Mountjoy Prison in difficult circumstances.  If the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum, built in 1854, is unsuitable for mentally ill patients, Mountjoy Prison is ten times more unsuitable for the imprisonment of people if we have any intention of bringing them back into society improved, with a different attitude or with different prospects.  Drugs are rife in these places and we must deal with the prison system in its entirety.<\/p><p>I wanted to get all of that off my chest because it has to be said.  I congratulate the Minister of State for being the person who brings this Bill, which is an improvement, forward.  I hope I am not being negative or throwing cold water on that if I say that if this is the collective response of Ireland and if we pat ourselves on the back and say that this is the day we really did something to improve psychiatric services, etc., in the criminal justice system in Ireland, we are seriously deluding ourselves.  We are only dealing with 5% to 10% of the problem that exists.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#M01200","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for her response on Second Stage, particularly to my question about the relocation of the Central Mental Hospital, albeit that the first half of 2021 is still unclear.  From what she said - and I appreciate she is just being realistic - it seems it could be as late of June of next year.  Given the urgency with which this Bill is being taken through, to which we do not object, it seems unfortunate that it will take so long to have the relocation carried out.  Senator McDowell's amendment specifies a nearer date, which would be welcome.<\/p> <p>The Senator raised a number of important points about prison conditions more generally.  Like him, I pay tribute to Grainne McMorrow on her report into the dreadful murder of Gary Douch and what it showed us about the appalling conditions in Mountjoy Prison at the time, including the overcrowding and the lack of facilities for people with mental and psychiatric illness in the prison.<\/p> <p>Without rehashing that debate there were a number of problems with the Thornton Hall project as originally envisaged.  At the time, the Irish Penal Reform Trust raised concerns about the scale of that prison development.  Some 2,200 places were proposed and it was being described as a supermax prison or an Irish equivalent of that.  There was a lot of concern about cost and there was concern about the proposed location of the Central Mental Hospital on the same campus.  I am conscious that, as Senator Boyhan rightly said, the hospital is a hospital and not a prison.  The Portrane site is infinitely preferable because it is a hospital site, which is important.  It is hard to believe that the McGuinness report to which Senator McDowell referred was back in 2011.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Ivana Bacik:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is a long time ago.  Her report said the site at Thornton Hall should be built upon for a new prison but at a dramatically scaled-down size.  That expert group did not agree with the 2,200 proposal and, indeed, I believe its proposal was for a much smaller prison built along more therapeutic and rehabilitative lines to house no more than 500 people in one facility and 200 in another.  It is extraordinary that nine years after that report, we still do not have any facility there.  I would agree; I was a regular visitor to Mountjoy Prison over many years and saw first-hand the improvements that were carried out on site.  It is still, however, a prison that dates back to 1850 in which the cells are woefully inadequate for modern conditions.<\/p><p>To return to the matter of relocation, which is the subject of this welcome Bill, the point about capacity we spoke about earlier ties in with the timeframe in this amendment.  While we have all acknowledged that the increase to 170 places is welcome, we have also acknowledged that it is not enough.  Like many of my fellow members of a previous Oireachtas justice committee, I believe we should be reducing the numbers in our prisons and relying more on community-based sanctions, particularly for non-violent minor offences.  At the same time, we need to see an increase in forensic beds and psychiatric places to enable us to deal with the waiting list which I have described and to which Professor Harry Kennedy and the director general of the Irish Prison Service have referred.  At any one time, 20 to 30 persons per week are waiting to get admission to the Central Mental Hospital.<\/p><p>I want to refer to one key issue.  There has been an increase in the number of people seeking treatment, but there has also been an increase in the amount of time people spend in detention in the Central Mental Hospital.  Clearly, that is a huge factor to be built into the timeframe for relocation.  Looking at the figures, much of this is to do with an increase in verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity.  Professor Kennedy told the justice committee that ten years ago, two persons per annum might have been brought into the Central Mental Hospital by virtue of one of those verdicts, but it is now up to approximately ten per annum.  He said that the average stay is approximately seven years for somebody who has been found not guilty by reason of insanity.  That has increased the average stay of a person in the CMH currently to 4.4 years from 2.1 years on average in 2008.  He is quoted as saying that when he started in the Central Mental Hospital, persons might have been in for a few months, received treatment and then were moved on.  As I have said, the average length of stay is now more than four years.  I was quite shocked to see that figure.  It must also be built in that this is clearly a big factor in the decreased room for manoeuvre and the decreased facility for referring persons in from the Prison Service.  We come then to this situation, to which Senator McDowell referred, where people within the Prison Service should be getting inpatient treatment in a hospital setting instead.  I wanted to put those issues on the record.  Again, however, I welcome the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#R00200","speaker":"1631","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I will make my point rather quickly and not hold up the discussion.

I believe, however, the way he has expressed his opinion today is most important and easy to understand.  He has expressed a strong view on where we are with mental health and people with mental health issues ending up in prisons, and he has set out that we are way behind in this country in terms of how we move forward with this issue.<\/p> <p>I raised a number of cases recently during a Commencement debate in the Seanad on the media coverage of shocking, appalling cases of prisoners being left in prisons in deplorable situations because there were waiting lists at the Central Mental Hospital.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I served on the board of Cloverhill Prison for two years, around 2003 and 2004.  People talk about the visiting boards of prisons as being nice little numbers to get but for me it was one of the most challenging things I ever did in public life.  When most people who have a heart and a conscience go on such committees they really become involved in the heartbreak.  The one thing people must do, as Senator McDowell knows, when they agree to go on one of these boards is to sign to represent the prisoners.  This is the one commitment people have to give.  In that situation, we meet all sorts of heartbreaking situations and I will certainly never forget some of them.  Even at that time, 15 or 16 years ago, the one thing that stuck out in my mind in some of the prison cases, which were not cases of murder or manslaughter, although there was one rather serious case but not at that end of the scale, was the number of people at the time who were saying to me they were suffering from deep depression and prison was not doing anything for them, despite the best efforts of excellent staff in most of the situations.  As part the committee's work, we visited Mountjoy and other jails.  What has been said about Mountjoy is right.  I accept that quite a lot of improvements have been made but still, in the times we are in, we really need to have a completely new plan and a new Mountjoy, wherever it is.<\/p><p>This brings us back to mental health.  Everybody in the Chamber knows the challenges.  We meet them every day with people and families with mental health issues.  Throughout the country, judges find themselves reluctantly having to send people with mental health issues to prison.  I have to vote with the Government today.  I do not know what we are doing with amendments and I will be supporting the Government.  This is why I very much concur with Senators McDowell, Bacik and Boyhan.  We really have to take a new approach to all of this.  What is being done here today is really good and I know the Minister of State is totally committed.

I do not necessarily subscribe to the view that Thornton Hall was a mistake and I certainly do not subscribe to the view that it should have been scaled back.  There was potential there for a centre of excellence where we would have had as many supports as possible on the one campus.  Just because we are speaking about scaling up does not mean scaling in a bad way.<\/p> <p>It is correct that this is not even 5% of what we need to be doing but it is still an incremental positive step and, in fairness, Senator McDowell acknowledged this.  The statistic that has been quoted, that the average stay of a person in the Central Mental Hospital is four years, is troubling and worrying.  We have a situation where judges have no choice but to commit people with mental illness to jail and it is not acceptable.  This is why we need to scale up.  This is why Portrane is a significant improvement.<\/p> <p>It is hard to know the timeline for getting this right.

These are important issues and need to be aired, heard and acted upon.  Like Senator Murphy, I am unsure of the amendment's status.  I hope that it will flag that this issue needs more consideration in the House.  I am unsure as to whether the amendment will be pressed, but it has given the issue an airing.  The issue should get further airings.<\/p><p>Senator Bacik is right about the penal reform report.  Its recommendations were groundbreaking.  Many reports by Oireachtas committees make good proposals, but do the committees or their successors in subsequent terms ever follow up on them and carry out critical analyses of what was achieved as a result of the reports, the investment of time, effort and taxpayers' resources that went into compiling them and whether they made any real difference?  At the time, this particular report got a significant airing in the media and was welcomed by stakeholders, those with an interest in the matter and even the then Government.  The evolving implementation of the recommendations, which were welcomed and lauded, needs to be scoped out.  Perhaps a body like the Seanad Public Consultation Committee could examine some of these critical reports and whether we achieved our aims.<\/p><p>The Minister of State is listening.  I do not doubt her commitment to this issue.  If the House is discussing this matter again in 2023 or 2024 after the Minister of State and her team have had a good run at it for 36 or 48 months, I believe we will have seen a difference.

Substantial public moneys were spent on Thornton Hall.  The site has been acquired and is in State ownership.  When I raised a number of questions with the then Minister for Justice and Equality, he indicated to me that it was his view that there was a requirement to retain Thornton Hall under the remit of his Department and that there were plans.  As such, the Department has not agreed to relinquish these lands to the Land Development Agency or anyone else.<\/p> <p>Sometimes, one must have courage.  It was courageous to take on this project.  As Senator Bacik mentioned, there was a recommendation in the McGuinness report to modify it.  We now have a facility that has the capacity and potential to provide a place of detention.  It should be utilised.  It would be a travesty and waste if that asset was squandered and left abandoned.  We should revisit this matter collectively, given our responsibility to the taxpayer.  We also have a responsibility in terms of the detention of people in our prison system.  If the facilities are not fit for purpose, we must do something about them.  We have acquired the Thornton Hall site.

The Psychiatric Nurses Association has expressed and put on record its concerns over a proactive recruitment drive.  It is suggested by the association that an additional 200 staff will be needed.  We need to focus on that now because there is a long lead-in time to get people with the necessary expertise.  The new hospital in Portrane is going to offer a whole new range of services, as the Minister of State has set out well.  We need support, assistance and expertise on the ground for this facility.<\/p><p>The Minister of State might also address the issue of the cost to fit the place out.  She has acknowledged in her contribution that there needs to be a fit-out and there is a cost involved here.  Hopefully, we will have all this done in the next few months, but it would be an ambitious target to get this place up and running in three months, although it would be great if it happens.

Those matters were a little before my time in national politics although I was always involved at local level.  I do not doubt for one minute the bona fides of Senator McDowell, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, nor do I doubt the passion with which he has spoken about the challenges in the justice system, especially for those suffering from mental health issues.  I take on board everything he has said.<\/p> <p>I believe the Portrane hospital will be a significant improvement.  We are increasing capacity by approximately 70%, if we agree the capacity of the current hospital is 100 because there are 93 patients there currently and there were 102 last year.  That capacity will rise to 170.  For the fist time, there will be a 20-bed female unit.  That is significant.  There will also be a ten-bed child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, unit for forensic mental health.  That is important in our country.<\/p> <p>I believe the welfare and quality of care that will be available here will be an improvement because of the surroundings in which patients will be living.  The inpatient units are centred around a series of courtyards with secure perimeter gardens.  The courtyard arrangements facilitate collective activities, therapies and direct access to fresh air for patients from each ward.  Each unit has internal gardens, exercise facilities and shared communal spaces for patients.  Glass is used internally to create space and improve access to sunlight.  There are domestic-scale buildings of a single storey and each unit has a front door.  The hospital is laid out in a series of pavilion buildings around a village green or village centre.  That really impressed me.  The village centre includes primary healthcare facilities, sporting and exercise facilities, educational and vocational facilities, including art and woodwork rooms, and a concert hall.  There are also social facilities such as a caf&eacute;, shop and library.  There is a landscape village green area where we hope patients will be able to sit out with their families and visitors when visiting is facilitated.  There is also a large horticultural area, including polytunnels and animal pens, where patients can become involved in gardening and looking after the animals.  I know that 85% of all patients currently in the facility in Dundrum have come through the judicial system but we must remember that patients have ill mental health and need mental health supports.<\/p> <p>I will return to the situation around the project.  It was due to be handed over from the builder to the HSE on 18 December.  That is not going to happen.  A phased opening of the campus was envisaged for around mid-March 2021, following the completion of the equipping and commissioning stages.  The latest update from the HSE indicates that the builder handover will occur in the first quarter of 2021 - late January or early February - with the opening pushed to the second quarter of the year, assuming no further delays.  <\/p> <p>The proposed amendment seeks to change the definition of the closure date set out in section 4.  As we have said, the Bill is technical in nature and while its aims are straightforward, it is legislatively complex to achieve them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Mary Butler:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The hospital must operate without interruption during the period of its relocation.  A continued lawful basis for the detention of people currently based there must be maintained throughout.  The new Central Mental Hospital is at an advanced stage of construction but it has not been handed over yet.  When the campus is handed over from the builder, a period of equipping, as I have said, will need to take place.  Staff training must also be completed.<\/p><p>Relocating the Central Mental Hospital and its patients is a huge logistical operation with multiple strands.  It is further complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has impacted many aspects of the project.  Having legislation in place in good time provides some certainty in planning for the move.  The legislation grants the Minister the flexibility to set the relocation date by order and to set a closure date not less than three months after that date by order, which is important for practical reasons.  It allows for the relocation day and closure day to be carefully aligned with progress of the project.  This is crucial, given the logistics of a move on this scale.  It allows for a carefully timed and orderly transition from the old facility to the new, controlling for any external factors that might impact on the planning dates.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#V00400","speaker":"1614","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":71,"content":"<p>I will not press the amendment.  As the Minister of State can appreciate, the reason Senator Boyhan and I put down the amendment was so there could be a more discursive debate on the subject than would have happened if we simply had a Second Stage debate, which would have petered out after short contributions.  In that context, I thank the Leader of the House for agreeing to an extension of the time for debate because it is useful that we discuss on the record the wider implications of what we are and are not doing and how these things can be achieved.<\/p> <p>When it comes to Thornton Hall, I do not believe in the \"lock 'em up\" approach.  It is usually younger men rather than women who go to prison, but I regard any person who is sent to prison as a personal tragedy, especially in our present prison system.  Despite all the efforts of the prison officers and Prison Service staff, it is very difficult to turn somebody out from a prison in a better condition than when he or she went in.  There are many reasons that the reverse often takes place.<\/p> <p>In respect of what Senator Bacik said, I have always taken the view that prison must be a measure of last resort.  I always believed that there should be, in statute form, a clear indication that a district judge who sentences somebody to six months in jail should set out in writing the reasons that no other approach is appropriate.  If it had to be in their own handwriting, it might give judges 20 minutes to reflect on whether they are doing something good for the young man - it is usually a man - or for society.  What will be the net result?<\/p> <p>It is often the case that a district judge imposes a sentence to teach a lesson in the knowledge that a Circuit Court judge to whom an appeal will almost certainly be made will suspend the sentence.  A judge may frighten the bejaysus out of somebody in those circumstances but there are people who, for whatever reason, do not get to appeal.  They go into the system and are spat out in a worse condition than they went into it.  Governors of prisons do their best through temporary release and so on.  The Prison Service does its best to look after prisoners by allocating them to different kinds of institutions but, in the end, that is the situation.<\/p> <p>Returning to Senator Bacik's point, our population is growing.

On different occasions, Senators Murphy and Boyhan have served on prison visiting committees, and I know, from private conversations, that they both took their functions very seriously.  There was a time when it was thought that this was a gravy train that the Minister for Justice used as a kind of informal honours system to get cronies into various places.  Even if that did happen to some extent, I found that those who served on prison visiting committees suddenly had their eyes opened.  Indeed, as Senator Murphy said, whatever their motives were in volunteering to serve, they performed a very valuable function and they humanised a system which needed it.

As Senators know, the purpose of the Social Welfare Bill is to give legislative effect to the changes announced on budget day.  The Estimate for the Department of Social Protection in 2021 is &euro;25.1 billion.  This is more than &euro;4 billion larger than the Department's budget day allocation for 2020.  Much of that additional spending will be required to meet the ongoing costs of the pandemic unemployment payment and other jobseeker's payments and supports.  I am pleased, even in these difficult times, to have also been able to secure almost &euro;300 million for a series of targeted measures to support some of the most vulnerable groups in our society.  In addition, the Bill provides for maintaining the State pension at age 66 years, as committed to in the programme for Government.  This measure will cost more than &euro;200 million in 2021 and more than &euro;415 million in a full year.<\/p><p>It is important to point out that some of the social protection measures announced on budget day do not require primary legislation and, therefore, are not reflected in this Bill.  These measures include the Christmas bonus, which I am pleased to say was paid last week, to a record 1.6 million recipients with payments totalling &euro;390 million.  I would like to take this opportunity to again encourage people to spend their Christmas bonus locally this year and support small businesses as they reopen their doors.<\/p><p>Other budget day measures that are not included in the Bill include an increase in the earnings disregard for disability allowance by &euro;20 from &euro;120 to &euro;140.  This will, like the Christmas bonus, be done by regulation.  In addition, as a non-statutory scheme, the increase of &euro;3.50 per week in the fuel allowance payment does not require amending legislation nor does the extension of the hot school meals programme.<\/p><p>I will now discuss the Bill.  Section 1 provides for definitions used in this Bill.  Currently, employer PRSI is charged at a rate of 8.8% on employee's weekly earnings of between &euro;38 and &euro;395.  Section 2 increases the reckonable earnings threshold for employees by &euro;3 to &euro;398 whereby employer PRSI contributions can continue to be paid at this lower rate of 8.8%.  This provision is designed to take account of the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;10.10 to &euro;10.20 per hour from 1 January 2021.  Employers with employees benefitting from the increase in the minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of PRSI.  It is intended that this section will come into operation on 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>Section 3 provides that, for the purposes of the Covid-19 employment wage support scheme, the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister for Social Protection may share information<b><\/b>relevant to the effective operation of the scheme.  A similar provision was included in legislation establishing its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  The employer PRSI contribution for the TWSS is 0.5%.  Section 4 provides that an identical employer contribution is made for the EWSS.<\/p><p>Illness benefit is at present paid after an initial waiting period of six days.  Section 5 reduces the number of waiting days from six to three days.  This will ease the financial strain on employees, especially those who do not have occupational sick pay arrangements as part of their contract of employment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As Senators will be aware, the Department of Enterprise, Trade end Employment is conducting a public consultation on the introduction of a statutory right to paid sick leave for all employees.  I encourage all interested parties to engage with this consultation and make known their views on statutory sick pay.<\/p><p>Section 6 provides that self-employed pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, recipients can engage in limited self-employment and earn up to &euro;960 over a rolling eight-week period and continue to maintain entitlement to PUP.  Section 7 is a regulation-making power so that the Minister can prescribe by statutory instrument the income and expenses that can be included to reach the &euro;960 limit.  These provisions allow self-employed people to carry out some work and still retain the PUP.  I know this measure has been warmly welcomed by taxi drivers, musicians, electricians, plumbers and other self-employed workers across the country.<\/p><p>Injury benefit is a payment made to employee contributors who are unable to work due to an injury or an occupational disease sustained in the course of their employment and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  Section 8 reduces the waiting days from six to three for this payment.  Like illness benefit, the reduction in waiting days is intended to take effect in March 2021.<\/p><p>Section 9 provides for an increase to the widowed or surviving civil partner grant by &euro;2,000, from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000.  This is the first time this grant has been increased since 2008.  Where a person finds himself or herself in the tragic position where a loved one has passed away and he or she is looking after dependent children, this increased payment is intended to provide a small extra help.  This measure will take effect from 1 January 2021.<\/p><p>Section 10 removes the earnings limit on the one-parent family payment.  Currently, when a lone parent's earnings exceed &euro;425 per week, he or she loses entitlement to one-parent family payment.  The intention behind this provision is to tackle in-work poverty and remove a potential poverty trap by allowing single parents who are in employment to earn over the current earnings limit and retain this payment.  This section will come into operation on 8 April 2021.<\/p><p>Section 11 provides for an increase of &euro;150 in the carer's support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850, which is the highest level at which it has ever been set.  The carer's support grant is an annual payment for carers who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.  The grant is paid annually in a single lump sum, usually on the first Thursday in June.  The grant is not means-tested or taxable.  This increase goes some way towards acknowledging the role family carers play in our society.<\/p><p>The working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement, is a weekly tax-free supplement available to employees with children.  It gives extra financial support to people on low pay.  Section 12 provides for a &euro;10 increase in the weekly income thresholds of the working family payment for families with up to three children.  This allows parents to earn more and still retain the payment.  This section will come into operation on 7 January 2021.<\/p><p>Section 13 provides that the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment may continue for a period of six weeks after death in certain circumstances.  This will bring the payment in line with other social protection payments for the unemployed, including jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit.<\/p><p>Sections 14 and 16 provide for increases in the qualified child payment.  The weekly rate for a qualified child will increase by &euro;2, from &euro;36 to &euro;38, for children under the age of 12.  It will increase for children aged 12 and over by &euro;5, from &euro;40 to &euro;45.  This means increases in respect of 419,000 children.  Sections 14 and 16 also provide for an increase of &euro;5 in the living alone allowance.  This will benefit more than 221,700 pensioners and people with disabilities.<\/p><p>Section 15 provides for an increase of &euro;7.30 in the weekly payment of the island allowance, bringing the rate to &euro;20 per week for people living on an offshore island.  It is an increase to the weekly value of certain social welfare payments.  The intention of this is to compensate for the additional costs of living on the islands when compared with people resident on the mainland.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The intention of this is to compensate for the additional costs of living on these islands when compared with people resident on the mainland.

The programme for Government commits that the planned increase in the State pension age next year will be deferred.  It will remain at 66 years pending the report of the Commission on Pensions.  The Commission on Pensions has been established and will report by June 2021.  In the meantime, the Bill provides that the State pension age will remain at 66 years and not increase to 67 years on 1 January 2021 or 68 years in 2028.  This will allow the Commission on Pensions to consider State pensions policy issues fully and make recommendations for the future unfettered.  Section 18 provides for the Short Title to the Bill and its construction and collective citation with the Social Welfare Acts.<\/p><p>In the context of a budget that has to be constrained due to dealing with the public health crisis caused by Covid-19 as well as the potential consequences of Brexit, we have focused on the vulnerable groups in society who are most at risk.  Given the environment we are operating in and the major economic challenges we are facing, it was simply not possible to do everything we wanted in budget 2021.  We have sought to target resources to support our most vulnerable, including those who live alone, carers, people with disabilities and low-income families.<\/p><p>As we speak about the Social Welfare Bill, and the many positive measures contained in it which will take effect from 1 January 2021, it is important to reflect on the year gone by.  I wish to take this opportunity in the Seanad to acknowledge the extraordinary work of the staff of the Department of Social Protection during this unprecedented year.  As public representatives we all engage with the staff of the Department at local level through our constituency offices.  I know the Members will agree with me in acknowledging the extraordinary effort the staff in the Department have put in this year at a time of national crisis to ensure payments were issued to those who needed them.  To date, under the pandemic unemployment payment, the Department has issued over 13 million payments to 800,000 people.  Let us put that into perspective.  It is the equivalent of seven years' worth of jobseeker's applications in eight months.  That gives Members some idea of the scale of the task with which the staff were faced.  In the past ten days alone, over &euro;500 million issued between the Christmas bonus and the arrears on the pandemic unemployment payment.  That included &euro;389 million issued to over 311,000 people as part of the Christmas bonus and a further &euro;130 million in pandemic unemployment payment arrears issued to over 286,000 people.  These are enormous numbers in financial terms and in terms of the number of people impacted in that ten-day period alone.<\/p><p>What is sometimes forgotten is that the Department of Social Protection and its staff have managed to do all that work this year on top of everything else that they do as part of their normal day-to-day work.  This includes processing pensions, disability and carer's allowances as well as applications for all the other payments.  It is sometimes easy to take for granted that everything will run smoothly and that payments will be made every week.  However, a great deal of work goes on behind the scenes to make that happen.  It really has been an extraordinary effort across the board by staff in every county this year and I wish to acknowledge those efforts in the Seanad today.  I imagine all Senators will join me when I say a big \"thank you\" to the staff of the Department of Social Protection.  They too have been front-line workers during this pandemic.<\/p><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators on the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#CC00400","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  It is great to have her here to discuss the Bill.  The tone in which she ended her contribution was very important.  The work that has been done by social welfare staff throughout the country has to be acknowledged.  It has been an unbelievable year in so many ways.  We have gone through a health crisis and we have Brexit pending in the back of people's minds as well.  The Minister's staff in the Department have done so much good work.  They drafted a Bill and got it up and running in less than a week.  The pandemic unemployment payment has provided so much security to people.  That was an amazing achievement.  The volume of work done at a departmental level to make sure that people got over the horrendous first lockdown has to be acknowledged.  What society went through in those seven or eight weeks and the way in which the Minister's Department reacted so swiftly is a credit to the people who work in there, and the Minister and her predecessor.  That should be acknowledged in the Chamber.<\/p> <p>The Bill brings so much to the table.  A budget of more than &euro;25 billion is significant for society, and there are many positive provisions in it.  It is important we acknowledge that.  The pension debate has been ongoing for generations.  It is important we are having the debate again and that we are stepping back.  We now have a date for the review.  That is an important step for society and will give clarity to people.<\/p> <p>The Minister has responsibility for the islands.  One of the key measures she mentioned on budget day and again today is the significant increase to the allowance for the 600 people who live on the islands.  Many of them are from my part of the world.  We have several islands off the coast of County Cork that are vibrant with great communities living on them.  They got a great bounce not alone from the financial support the Minister's contribution has made but also in knowing they were remembered and acknowledged and had not been forgotten.  That was a really important step.  For an allowance not to change in more than two decades and then for it to change so significantly was something the people in the island communities really appreciated.  I recall budget day well because of the number of phone calls I got from west Cork in particular and from the islands saying \"Jesus, we got a mention in the budget\".  It meant so much to a really small sector of society.  It is very important we acknowledge the offshore island allowance, which has gone up quite considerably from &euro;12.70 to &euro;20.  This is about symbolism and letting people know that we have not forgotten them and that they are a part of our plans.  That is a really important step forward in how we will regenerate those island communities, which have so much to offer.  When one visits them, one really understands their viability.  They really want to be a very important part of our communities.<\/p> <p>As for the Bill, the Minister has gone through the sections in detail, and many Senators will contribute to the debate on them.  This is significant legislation.  It is important it gets passed before the end of this week because the payments are time-sensitive.  It is important that these issues be looked at and, I hope, delivered on between now and next Friday.  I will do what I can from this side of the House to make sure we get this very important legislation and these amendments through the Houses so we have this Bill on the Statute Book when the new year comes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#FF00100","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and join colleagues in congratulating her, her predecessor and her officials.  Without doubt they have taken on a mammoth task and performed above and beyond the call of duty.  It was amazing to hear the Minister outline the figures.  Figures tend to baffle people, and we tend to switch off when we hear them, but today she delivered them well, and they give us some idea of the mammoth task she has undertaken.  I wish her well for the most part as she goes forward.<\/p> <p>I have one slight issue with the Bill, namely class K PRSI.  I hope to table an amendment on this, which I hope the Minister will consider.  The social insurance system operates through the Social Insurance Fund, and contributions are paid into the fund to finance a range of contributory social insurance benefits, pensions and other payments.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also provision for the Exchequer to subvent the fund if expenditure exceeds income.  Since 1979, the term \"pay-related social insurance\" has been used to describe the social insurance within the Minister's Department.  Five social insurance schemes fall into three categories, namely, contributory social insurance schemes, non-contributory or mean-tested schemes and childcare benefits.  Social assistance arrangements are on a means-tested basis and do not form part of the Social Insurance Fund.  Similarly, the child benefit payment does not form part of the Social Insurance Fund.  I wish to focus is solely on contributory social insurance schemes, particularly class K.<\/p><p>The only people subject to class K PRSI are Oireachtas Members and holders of public office.  We have already had to go to the courts regarding class K PRSI for city and county councillors.  Thankfully, it did not result in a court case.  Rather, the Government moved to change county councillors onto class S PRSI.  For most people in this House, class K PRSI means nothing one way or the other.  We have a good job with a good salary and are well looked after while we are here.  However, not all Members will be here for the full 20 years' service needed in order to acquire a pension.  Not all Members will be here after serving their first term.  It is the ones who are not here, those who lost their seats in the election, about whom I am most concerned.<\/p><p>We are in the middle of a pandemic; that is for sure.  Some former Members of the Oireachtas lost their D&aacute;il or Seanad seats last February or last April.  Having lost their seats, they found that they had no social insurance to fall back on.  They had no welfare entitlements other than those under the means-tested allowance system.  It is pretty horrendous to think that, after four years' service to the State, one has nothing to show for it and nothing to gain from it.  It is not just the individual Members of this House who lose out; it is also their families.  It is about the long-term impact that class K PRSI has inflicted on those of us who serve the State through the Oireachtas, the Judiciary or various other forms of public office.  At the end of one's period in office, such as if one serves only one term in the Oireachtas, for example, not only has one damaged one's social protection record in terms of entitlement to payments, one has also damaged one's entitlement to long-term payments such as the contributory old age pension, maternity entitlements and entitlements to various optical and dental benefits.<\/p><p>This issue simply was not examined properly back in 2011.  Indeed, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, raised the issue in 2011 when he asked what class K gives us?  Absolutely nothing.  There are no benefits from it.  We are paying exactly the same amount of our income as a person on class S or class A.  That is simply wrong in every sense of the word.  Former Deputy Sandra McLellan asked a similar question of the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton.  The response of the then T&aacute;naiste was that there is jobseeker's allowance.  There may be jobseeker's allowance, but if one moves onto a jobseeker's allowance, it does nothing to the damaged record one leaves behind and it does nothing to the loss of income one's family is suffering as a result.  I know the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is very much up to speed on this issue and is concerned about it.  One must remember that holders of public office are well paid, but when one loses one's seat, one has nothing.  It is really depressing to speak to some former Members of this House and to see how desperately impacted they have been as a result of Covid-19.  They are not even able to look for a job now. <\/p><p>I do not wish to impede the passage of the Bill.  I wish to support the Minister in every way I can because there are hundreds of thousands of people depending on the Bill and the way it is driven through the House.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Gerard P.

We are talking about a tiny number of people in the grand scheme of things.  I do not believe that any Member of this House or any public office holder should fail to make a contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.  We should and it is quite right that we do.  Those who are unfortunate enough to lose their seat after one term should be able to fall back on the benefits to which they are entitled and their social welfare record must not be damaged.  That is the most important aspect of this.  <\/p><p>There is a discussion to be had in this House with respect to how we manage the pension entitlements, for example, of Members who have served.  We cannot have a situation where somebody leaves the Oireachtas on a full Oireachtas pension and also has an entitlement to a contributory old age pension.  That would be anathema to those on much lower incomes and those who depend solely on the State pension.  There is a discussion to be had on that but we need to do something straight away for those who were unfortunate enough in February and April to lose their seats.  It is distressing to think that people who held a position of high esteem in the nation are suddenly unemployed but not entitled to any payment.  I believe the Minister cares about this and perhaps we can work on it without requiring an amendment to be brought through the House.  I am willing to discuss it with her.  I know she has an interest in it and wants to ensure that everybody is treated equally in this country.  That is my sole issue of concern.  <\/p><p>I compliment her on everything she has provided for in the Bill, especially for the islands.  I spent a lot of my youth visiting the islands with my father and compliment the Minister on the provisions in the Bill for them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#FF00200","speaker":"1645","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes this Bill, which gives effect to unprecedented levels of expenditure in budget 2021.  Aside from the enormous levels of expenditure, the Bill also provides that the change to the State pension age previously planned for 1 January 2021 will be deferred.  The pension age will remain at 66 pending the report of the commission on pensions.  The planned increase from 67 to 68, which is scheduled to happen on 1 January 2028, is also being repealed so that the commission on can consider matters relating to the State pension age unconstrained by any prospective changes scheduled in legislation.<\/p> <p>Regulations are also being brought forward so that 65 year olds who are required to or choose to retire early can achieve an early retirement allowance or pension at the same rate as jobseeker's benefit without a requirement to sign on.  Many Members have been contacted by people who worked all of their lives and when they retired, they had to go through a process, unfamiliar to them, of attending their local social welfare office.  This caused huge upset and anger among many who had paid taxes all their lives.  There will not be a requirement to sign on, to partake in any activation measures or to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  <\/p> <p>Other measures in the Bill provide for hugely welcome increases in the carer's support grant, the living alone allowance, the fuel allowance and the working family payment threshold.  It also provides for the removal of the one-parent family earnings threshold.  These are all very welcome provisions, especially in light of Covid-19 and the year we are having.  The pandemic has had a significant impact on social welfare expenditure as we know, with &euro;27.3 billion spent by the end of November.  This is almost &euro;8 billion ahead of the Estimates at the start of 2020 or 41% higher than originally planned.  No Government has ever spent as much on social protection.  This spending is happening in the context of a one in 100 or even 200-year event, a global pandemic that hopefully we will not see the likes of again.  <\/p> <p>As the Minister said, this budget does not go far enough for everyone and I agree.  The basic rate of social welfare was not increased for many people, so nothing has changed for them.  They remain on the same social welfare rate but the cost of living has increased massively.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Ardagh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We know the public service obligation levy will be increased by nearly 130%, a huge increase of nearly &euro;90 annually in the cost of people's electricity bills.  This is just one item on which we spend our money.<\/p><p>It is really important to consider the cost of living inflation and look to a future where the basic social welfare levels are harmonised with the cost of living inflation.  People on a set income - those on social welfare, and especially the long-term unemployed or people on the State pension that will not see an increase - have no capacity to gain extra income.  It is really important we do not leave people behind and we must not widen the gap between rich and poor.  We must ensure our poverty levels do not go through the roof.  Some people have stated the cost of living will go up by 5% or 6%, for example.<\/p><p>I raised the question of the fuel allowance before.  We very much welcome the increase in the fuel allowance but there has been no increase in income thresholds so that more people can benefit from being in receipt of the fuel allowance.  We all know the fuel allowance comes with many ancillary benefits, and one of the main benefits that people in Dublin get is the wrapping of homes in insulation.  This fantastic and successful scheme has been done in conjunction with local health boards.  Many people were just above the income threshold and did not qualify for the fuel allowance and were unable to get that benefit.<\/p><p>It is important to consider these thresholds for the fuel allowance, especially as we are in an era of just transition from fossil fuel use.  We are also looking at carbon taxes and modifying homes to ensure they are of a higher standard.  The fuel allowance is currently being used to retrofit homes and it may have a larger role to play in the just transition.  I would like to see an increase in income levels so more people could qualify.  There is a public service obligation levy on the provision of electricity.  It may be worthwhile seeing if those in receipt of the fuel allowance could be made exempt from this as it is a huge amount each year for people but it would not amount to much more for the Department.<\/p><p>I congratulate the staff in the Minister's Department as any time we make queries, they are very efficient.  I thank them for helping me.  They put seven years of work into a few months, as has been mentioned, and that is just unbelievable.  They should be commended as people can be very slow to commend the people working behind computers.  On my behalf and that of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I say that we are very grateful to the Minister and her staff in the Department.<\/p><p>During the pandemic, we saw many food banks open and volunteers working in them.  It is a pity that we are again seeing them open around Christmas.  I know the pandemic unemployment payment filled a space but there is a huge gap arising because people need basic essentials and food items.  I do not know if the Department has looked at food credits or some extra way in which people could purchase food on top of the PUP or a social welfare benefit.  It amazes me to see the amount of need and the type of people who attend food banks looking for a food hamper.  These are people we might not think need such hampers.  We need to be cognisant of the issue.  It is not ideal that people have to attend food banks but it is happening so we must see if there is something we can do to help people a little more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#HH00200","speaker":"1630","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House I thank her for the considerable work she and the Department have done, particularly in recent months.  The Labour Party will be supporting the Bill, as we have done previously.<\/p> <p>There is an important inclusion in this Bill, which repeals the section on the pension age, as other Members have said.  I thank all those involved in the Stop 67 campaign.  They insured that this important issue for so many of our fellow citizens was centre stage on the political agenda and received the amount of coverage that such an important matter deserved.  I want to use this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to the National Women's Council of Ireland, Age Action, Active Retirement Ireland and SIPTU for their work and time on this important matter.<\/p> <p>In addition to repealing the increase in the pension age, it will become important that we address the need for those who reach the age of 65 to sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  In recent months, I have been contacted, as have other Members, by women and men who have worked all their lives and now face the prospect of standing in a queue to sign on.  This is something that so many of them have never done before in their lives.  They also face the prospect of being called to participate in a job activation scheme.  I am aware that the Minister intends to bring in regulations which will formally remove the current requirements for people aged 65 and over to sign on, participate in activation programmes or give an undertaking that they are genuinely seeking work.  This will be welcomed by those who I have spoken to in recent months.  The Minister might confirm the timeframe involved in bringing forward these important matters.<\/p> <p>I welcome the inclusion in this Bill of the extension of the limit on the PUP to &euro;960 for self-employed workers over an eight-week period, particularly for musicians, taxi drivers and all tradespeople.  I acknowledge a recent presentation we received as members of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands from Senator Black on this important matter on behalf of those in the music and entertainment industry and I acknowledge the many representations I have received from those in this industry.  It is an issue I have highlighted through the committee, along with fellow committee members.  Musicians and artists have struggled with previous limits and with holding on to their PUP.  I agree that this will give them a chance to maintain this payment.  We want to see our musicians and artists back playing and working under some sort of normality.  I sincerely hope this change will make a difference to many of them until we see that normality return, hopefully quickly.<\/p> <p>I wish to highlight the need to change the PUP to allow those workers under 18 to qualify for the payment, should they need to do so.  I have previously raised this in the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and I know it forms part of the recommendation on the PUP sent back to the Minister following the review of this payment by the committee.  It is an issue that has been brought up with me locally several times.  It must be reviewed so that those of this age who pay their taxes and PRSI and currently do not qualify will qualify.<\/p> <p>Another area of this report that I would like to ask the Minister to consider is the issue of those who are self-employed and over 66 who are not eligible for a State pension.  We must acknowledge those who wish to work beyond their 66th birthday but we must also assist them.  These citizens should be deemed eligible for the PUP but I understand that currently they will not qualify for it.<\/p> <p>There was a lost opportunity to increase the income limits for the carer's allowance in the last budget.  I have raised this with the Minister previously and I cannot let the opportunity pass without raising it once more.  Figures I have received, along with Labour Party colleagues, tell us that 50% of all applications for carer's allowance are being refused.  One of the biggest reasons for this over a long period of time has been the income limits.  I am dealing with a case in which a family are &euro;5 above the limit.  They had been refused twice before they came to see me.  I have appealed this case and there is no doubt but that the loved one being cared for would be in State care if her daughter did not carry out the 24\/7 care she is providing at this time in looking after her mother.  She is like so many of the carers of the country who save the Government so much.  This was recently estimated at &euro;20 billion per year.  It is time to reassess these limits and beyond time to increase them.  The income limits have not been changed since 2012 and over 30,000 carers are being locked out of payment, according to figures recently released by Family Carers Ireland.  We must increase these limits.  Those caring must be paid for their work.<\/p> <p>There is an acknowledgement in section 11 of this Bill of the magnificent work being carried out by those who are in receipt of carer's allowance through a &euro;150 increase in the carer's support grant.  I welcome this increase and as I have said previously, those involved in providing care go above and beyond each day.  It is right to recognise that through an increased grant payment.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mark Wall:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As has been mentioned, there is also a welcome increase of &euro;3.50 in the fuel allowance.

Social protection and the Minister's Department may have to play a greater role when we eventually fully understand the consequences of the pandemic.

I, too, wish to start by commending the staff in the Department of Social Protection on their work and dedication.  Their commitment ensured those who were worst hit during the pandemic received vital financial supports in time.  I know many staff worked above and beyond to ensure the first wave of the pandemic unemployment payment was paid as quickly as possible.  They were front-line workers.  I know many recipients also received their arrears in the past two weeks and I hope all outstanding claims will be dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>This Bill is being debated on the last sitting week before the Christmas recess in a year in which more citizens than ever have had to engage with the Department.  We are also only several weeks away from January when many 65-year-olds will have to sign on the dole instead of being allowed to retire at that age.  Most of these citizens have already put in a lifetime of work.  People who have worked non-stop since their early teens will be forced to sign on the dole in January.  When we come into this House and talk about the progress we have made as a society, we should not forget that people who were mostly involved in manual labour and services have brought us to where we are.  Speaking as a young person, I believe many of my friends would identify with this issue, which is close to their hearts.  The Government should recognise this and afford these people the dignity of enjoying a well-earned retirement, if that is their choice.  I welcome that the legislation providing for an increase in the retirement age has been suspended pending the outcome of the pension commission's deliberations.  I do not believe there is a need for a commission.  There should be a commitment that no person will be forced to work past 65 years of age.<\/p> <p>I am disappointed to see JobPath has been extended into 2021.  JobPath is a bad system and a bad scheme.  It was set up with little consideration for workers trying to find employment and it has been a cash cow for two major companies in particular.  If a good news story were to come from this Bill, it would be that of ending the JobPath scheme.  These companies make &euro;311 for each of the more than 280,000 people who have been referred.  That is &euro;311 for being referred, not for securing lasting employment.  Some 33,000 people have been referred more than once and the companies get a referral fee for the same person twice.  The scheme has cost the taxpayer &euro;250 million and has a 7% success rate in securing permanent employment.  The Government is asking us to renew a scheme that is costing millions and has a success rate of 7%.  In the coming months, I hope many workers will return to the workforce.  JobPath is not the solution.  It is part of a legacy of austerity and should be scrapped.<\/p> <p>I thank the Deputies in the D&aacute;il, including Deputies Kerrane and Joan Collins, and also the Minister, for their engagement with the live music industry.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Fintan Warfield:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Amendments were successfully passed that will ensure musicians will not have to face losing the pandemic unemployment payment due to accepting casual gigs.  I thank the Minister for accepting those amendments on Committee Stage.  The engagement with the industry was crucial to understanding and communicating the exceptional nature of their work.  For instance, March is a busy month for musicians with St. Patrick's Day and over that weekend.  They have to make hay as the sun shines and they would do multiple gigs a day on a weekend whereas April is relatively quiet.  Prior to the amendment, musicians would have had to limit their earnings in March to &euro;480 whereas now they will be able to earn up to &euro;960 in that month whereas April is quiet.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister to move to provide some certainty around the future of the PUP before January for artists and musicians to be able to plan into next year.  They need to know this very basic support will still be available.  As she will know from her engagement with them and her time in the Department with responsibility for culture, the ability to plan gigs and performances for several months ahead is vital and without this certainty many of them will be facing very difficulty decisions over the next few months.  We cannot lose the talent that continues to create the culture in our communities and on this island.  There is much more to be done for artists and musicians who are still facing a period of uncertainty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#LL00200","speaker":"1686","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her well with the passage of this important Bill.  I congratulate her on the tremendous work she has done over a  difficult period in recent months.<\/p> <p>I support Senator Craughwell in what he said regarding Oireachtas Members.  I would add that while we pay PRSI at the K class, which is the same rate as an S class, there are no benefits to us from it.  It does not even qualify a person to sign for credits.  A person who lost his or her seat in the Seanad or the D&aacute;il at the last election or previous elections cannot even sign for credits.  That is an outrage.  It leaves some of them in a very poor state because, as we have seen with the pandemic, there are no jobs available and there are no places for them to get a job.  The Minister needs to closely examine this area.  <\/p> <p>I want to raise another issue with the Minister regarding the two weeks pay per year of service in redundancy that must be paid.  I refer in particular to self-employed people and sole traders.  When a business closes down there is no protection for the sole trader or the self-employed person.  There are protections for a person who is involved in a company or who owns a company.  The company can go into liquidation or voluntary liquidation but there is no such protection for the sole trader.  In 2003, an Act provided that two weeks pay per year of service had to be paid for each member of staff if they were been laid off either through redundancy or the closing of the business.  However, at that time there was clawback of 60% or 70%.  However, around 2014 the then Minister, Michael Noonan, got rid of the clawback which means self-employed people, whether they close their business or downsize it, have to pay two weeks salary per year of service for each person they had employed.  Since I raised this issue, I have received considerable correspondence from many people who were self-employed and from those in employment.  When the downturn came they had to downsize or, in many cases, close their businesses.  As a result of the pandemic, many businesses will not open their doors again.  The consequences for those people is that if they cannot pay their employees' redundancy of two weeks per year of service, the State will pay it for them, but the State will come looking for its pound of flesh at the end of the day.  What can the poor unfortunate person do in those circumstances?  The only asset they have left is the family home, which will be taken from them after they die or whenever.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paddy Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will introduce a Private Members&rsquo; Bill providing that the family home should be excluded in those circumstances.  The best way to proceed would be to bring back the clawback provision because the current position has serious consequences.  A man contacted me who could not keep his business going, he got rid of some of his staff and had to cash in his private pension to cover their redundancy payments.  He still was not able to make a go of the business and had to make a further allocation, which the Government paid because he had pleaded inability to pay, but now the State is looking for it out of his estate.  I raised the matter with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor and was told when the man dies or when his wife dies, that money will be taken out of his estate.  This issue has many of consequences in that there may be other family members in the home or children with disabilities and if the family home is sold that will have consequences.  It could have other consequences where the fair deal scheme could come into play for elderly people.  I ask the Minister to examine this area or she might support the Bill I intend to bring forward.  How does an employer make provision for something like this?  Any person who is self-employed or a sole trader can run into difficulties.  They can have many staff employed.  How do they plan for providing for staff ten or 20 years down the road when a huge sum of money may have to paid out?  There can be many consequences.  The Minister's Department has said that it will consider the Bill I will bring forward when it is published.  I thank the Minister and wish her well with this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#MM00200","speaker":"1636","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":115,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to the House.  I join others in thanking her and the Department for the manner in which they deal with their correspondence.  All Members have ongoing public representations to make.  I have always found the officials in the Department to be professional, timely and responsive and I ask the Minister to relay that to her senior officials.  It is important to acknowledge that.  We cannot say that about every Department but I can certainly say it about the Department of Social Protection.  When one makes a representation, one gets a receipt in a few days and there is a follow-up a few days later.  It is impressive and important, particularly in the area of social welfare and social protection where people are vulnerable.  They are hanging on for word of whether they are entitled to a benefit.  It is a tough business and I am conscious the Minister is not there to stand in anyone&rsquo;s way or stop people from getting what they are entitled to.  She would love to be in a position to be doubling up all of this.  I know where she is coming from and the budgetary constraints on her and on the Government.  Sometimes we forget the Minister is setting out what has been provided in the budget and that is as far as she can go.  I thank her for her enthusiasm and positivity within her Department, which needs to be acknowledged.<\/p> <p>I want to deal with sections 9, 11, 15 and 17.  I welcome the increase provided in section 9 for the widowed or surviving civil partner grant from &euro;6,000 to &euro;8,000, which is a substantial increase of &euro;2,000.  That is an important mark.  For the purposes of the widowed or surviving civil partner grant, will the Minister confirm whether a qualified child, that is, a child up to the age of 18, who is normally resident in the State and is still living with their parents will qualify for that money?  There was a suggestion that a child aged between 18 and 22 who is normally resident in the State continues to be a qualified child provided they are in full-time education in a recognised school or college.  The Minister might confirm that.  That is my understanding but I just wanted to check it with her.  She might also confirm when these measures will come into effect.  Will they come into effect on 1 January 2021?  <\/p> <p>Section 11 provides for an increase of &euro;150 in the carer&rsquo;s support grant, raising the payment to &euro;1,850, the highest level at which it has ever been.  That must be acknowledged.  That is a positive.  The carer&rsquo;s support grant is an annual payment for carers who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We would all like to give more.  It is a contribution and a recognition of what is needed.  Of course, we would like much more because there is no better place for people to be than in their communities and homes receiving carer support.  The increase is significant, however.  I know it is not enough but it is going in the right direction; it is not remaining static.  That is important.<\/p><p>I am concerned that carers cannot take up education or training opportunities of more than approximately 18.5 hours.  I believe it was a bit less last year or the year before.  This means that there are restrictions in the context of carers taking up such opportunities.  I am also conscious of the conflict regarding how carers can be pursuing education or training.  Many people must do both.  The Minister should address that.<\/p><p>The Minister has responsibility for the islands.  I am aware of her commitment to them.  The allowance of &euro;7.30 has increased now to &euro;20 per week.  The reality is, however, that people on the islands are experiencing difficulties and are at a slight disadvantage.  I ask the Minister to keep this matter under review going forward into next year.<\/p><p>Finally, the repeal in respect of the increase in the State pension age under section 17 is positive.  I heard a previous speaker stating that they had an issue with the Commission on Pensions.  I welcome its establishment.  I note, from a press statement she sent out, that the Minister was at one of its gatherings in the past few days.  This is a positive development.  There was a massive campaign about this issue in the run-up to the general election and now something is being done.  I acknowledge the work the Minister did in order to set up the commission.  She might address the timeline relating to it.  I believe it is supposed to report in June next year.  We need to keep the focus in this regard.  The commission is a response to an outcry from many people who wanted the matter in question examined.  The Minister might touch on how its work is going.

As she mentioned, it is wonderful to hear how the officials and staff from the Department with responsibility for employment affairs and social protection, who work in each and every county, stepped up in such heroic fashion to support people who literally found themselves, from one week to the next, with no income when we entered into lockdown.  The lockdown impacted mostly on young people and those in sectors such as retail, hospitality and tourism.  The Minister mentioned that more than &euro;13 billion is going to 800,000 people.  In terms of the processes, project management and commitment needed in this regard, the efforts of the Department of Social Protection have been Herculean.  We owe the Department a huge debt of gratitude.  When one thinks about it,182,000 people were on the live register in February.  That is one of the lowest numbers ever.  Huge numbers were in almost full employment in February and then the Department, which was previously under the stewardship of the Leader, Deputy Doherty, somehow turned the position around in the context of dealing with the lowest number of recipients ever to dealing with three times that number.  At present, the Department is providing payments to 535,000 people on the live register and the PUP.  I am honestly in awe of how that was done in such a fast turnaround time to provide support to people.<\/p> <p>The role of public representatives is, in particular, to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves.  The role of Government is to provide leadership and a lifeline to those in need in a crisis.   With the support and the budget secured by the Minister, the Department has given a lifeline to people and families in need.  The leadership and immediate response of the previous Government resulted in impressive achievements in the area of social welfare.  Fine Gael wants a just Ireland in which those who are most vulnerable will be protected.  We need to support people in need in this crisis.  The reason we can do so is that we are in a position to borrow at low rates.  The latter has meant that we can provide the PUP and fund the TWSS.<\/p> <p>I was proud to hear the Minister state that more than &euro;300 million has been allocated in targeted measures to vulnerable groups.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Aisling Dolan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of the measures mentioned by the Minister, one of the most crucial is payment of sick leave on the fourth day.  This is an immediate response to Covid-19.  We, as a Government, are asking people to stay home from work if they show any symptoms.  They will now, however, have support because sick pay is urgent.  The Minister mentioned that there is a consultation process with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We need all stakeholders to take part in that because sick pay should be a statutory right.  It is provided for in other countries in Europe.  That reduction in waiting time from six to three days, however, means a person will get some form of income if he or she cannot turn up to work.  In asking that person to stay home, stay safe and help protect others, we are now doing something to help and support them and their families.<\/p><p>Being able to earn up to &euro;960 over eight weeks on the PUP scheme means our artists, creatives, craftspeople, musicians, tradespeople and self-employed have an option to retain their PUP payment and also work.<\/p><p>The carer's support grant is close to my heart.  During the election campaign, I saw a presentation from the Family Carers Ireland group and the amount it does in saving the Exchequer money by the service it provides in homes really hit home.  This &euro;150 increase in the carer's support grant is welcome and raises the payment to &euro;1,850.  The Minister also mentioned that more than 130,000 carers can benefit from this increase next year.  Increasing our support towards carers, however, is something I will examine and work on in the years ahead.<\/p><p>I very much welcome the living alone allowance.  I was heartened to see funding last week under the Covid-19 stability funds from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, as well as the age and opportunity funds that went out to active age retirement groups.  There is huge loneliness and isolation for older people living at home.  We are asking them to stay away and stay at home, and yet, in this time, it is tough.  I, therefore, very much welcome the increase of &euro;5 for people living alone.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister, her teams, the Department and the officials.

To listen to some of the naysayers, one would think the previous Government did nothing.  I remind the House of Mr. Seamus Coffey, the eminent University College Cork, UCC, academic who has written on the issue of income and inequality.  The reality is that income growth and inequality is falling in our country at this time and as Mr. Pat Leahy wrote recently in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, people are getting richer and we are becoming more equal.

Qualified child payments, the living alone allowance, the offshore island allowance, as Senator Lombard mentioned, and the widowed or surviving civic partner grant have increased.  There has been a reduction in waiting times for illness benefit, an increase in the carer's support grant and the working family payment threshold and a removal of the one-parent family earnings limit.

I hope that the pandemic unemployment payment can be extended, if necessary, to people who are badly affected in the new year with the onset of the vaccination.

This increase is mainly for the pandemic unemployment payment and jobseeker's supports.  This is a clear example of the Government reacting to changing circumstances, and most importantly, being able to react.  We are able to react because of the work that previous Governments have done since 2011 to restore the economy and good name of this country and to enable us to borrow at low rates.

The commission will have to deal with an issue we have not been able to grapple with for some time.  In 2010, the then Government under the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, Lord have mercy on him, and the then Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Hanafin, produced the national pensions framework.  That report stated:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe inescapable fact is that for every pensioner we have now there are another six people at work to support them; by 2060, that figure will be less than two.  The sooner we face this inevitability, the better prepared we will be to meet it. <\/blockquote><p>The pensions commission has serious issues to deal with.  The decision not to go ahead with the increase in the pension age from next year is welcome because there are many people who are not able to work past a certain age because they are physically not able to work.  I am talking about tradesmen, whether it be plumbers, blocklayers or plasterers, who have jobs that are tough on their joints, knees, backs and necks.  It all impacts on their ability to continue working past 66 years of age and some of them who are younger than that unfortunately have to carry on if other supports are not available.  These are very difficult issues for some people but it is an issue the pensions commission will have to grapple with in terms of providing a sustainable footing for our pension system to ensure that people pay into it and that they can reap the reward in their old age.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#QQ00200","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":123,"content":"<p>I welcome the &euro;25 billion social welfare budget.

Would it not be fantastic for their learning and well-being if they were able to have a hot meal at school?<\/p><p>Let me refer to an initiative that I am not sure gets as much recognition as it deserves.  Schools that participate in the school meals programme were able to transfer from school meals to food parcels during the pandemic.  The parcels were given out weekly and contained food such as milk, fruit, vegetables and non-perishable goods.  It made such an incredible difference in the lives of recipients.  If taken up on in the way I envisage, it would benefit 250,000 children and 1,580 schools and organisations.  The programme was extended for the summer.  In the nine-week period of the summer, the families also got the food parcels.  These initiatives make such a big difference in people's lives.<\/p><p>Having lived in the North, and having plenty of family members and friends there, I believe it is absurd that an all-island party should say a pension age of 65 is the least people deserve in the South but not in the North.  Are the people in the North not as hard-working or deserving to Sinn F&eacute;in?  Will future generations in the North not deserve the same assurances on getting a pension when they turn a certain age as the people in the South?  Before people start crying out about Westminster, they should note Sinn F&eacute;in passed legislation in both 2012 and 2014 to raise the Northern Ireland state pension age to 67 by 2028 and to bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.  The pensions issue is such a serious one.  The pensions commission has serious work to do and the security of pensions should be taken seriously.  It deserves a bit more honesty.<\/p><p>To return to the issue of the Minister's work, I thank her Department.  I very much appreciate everything she has done and look forward to working with her on the rest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#RR00200","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":125,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is my first time addressing her in her new role.  I compliment her and her hard-working staff, as colleagues have done.  What has been done throughout the pandemic by her Department has been truly extraordinary.  The budget of &euro;25 billion is colossal but it is needed in times of Brexit and Covid uncertainty.<\/p> <p>I was delighted a number of years ago when the Department's name was changed from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the Department of Social Protection because what has been engaged in throughout the pandemic has been the protection of people's income.  The pandemic unemployment payment, which the Department has administered, has been an essential lifeline for so many.  I do not know how the Department has got through all the claims and managed to pay arrears in the past few weeks.  Great credit is due to the Minister's staff for the work they have done.<\/p> <p>I echo the comments of my colleague Senator Currie on the school meals programme.  It is probably not a programme that we usually hone in on, but as a former teacher in a DEIS school I believe it is invaluable.  We should not underestimate the importance of nutritious meals for students.  There are studies that link positive student behaviour with nutritious food, as opposed to junk food.  I share my colleagues' desire to get to a position in which many more students are in receipt of school meals.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator John Cummins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I wish to single out a couple of matters that have already been mentioned.  The increase to the carer's support grant, from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850, is very welcome.  I hope this trend will continue in future years because the work carers do is absolutely extraordinary.  The injury benefit, the reduction in the number of days and the increase of &euro;2,000 for widows and surviving partners are all welcome additions and improvements to the payments of the Department of Social Protection.<br\/><br\/>I would like to flag the issue of the fuel allowance.  Senator Ardagh mentioned this earlier.  I recognise the importance of the allowance, particularly considering its link to the warmer homes scheme and its role in reducing fuel poverty, but I wish to refer to a certain case I have encountered in respect of it.  According to the Department's webpage on income disregards for the fuel allowance, payments such as the Magdalen commission scheme payments, <i>ex gratia <\/i>payments for personal injuries suffered in the Stardust fire and compensation for people who have contracted hepatitis C are all disregarded, and rightly so, but there is an anomaly concerning the disablement benefit.  This probably relates to the word &quot;benefit&quot;.  The benefit may be payable where one has suffered a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  I believe it is because of the word &quot;benefit&quot; that disablement benefit is classified as income that disallows recipients from accessing the fuel allowance.  I am dealing with the case of a lady whose husband passed away recently.  She was in receipt of the fuel allowance but now that she is on her own, her payments are being examined.  She receives a small disablement benefit payment but the Department has stated that because it is a benefit, she is not entitled to the fuel allowance.  I ask the Minister to look into this case because of all the additional benefits the fuel allowance brings.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#SS00200","speaker":"1647","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":127,"content":"<p>My contribution will be quite short because many of my points have been made.  I am glad there is a general welcome for many of the provisions in the Bill, particularly in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I compliment the Minister, whom I have known for a long time, including through my radio work.  She takes on board what people say to her.  Any suggestions we have will certainly get a fair hearing.  I know this from my experience in the entertainment sector in particular.  People in that sector have asked me to thank the Minister for taking on board every point they made.  She has made a very welcome taxation change recently about which the sector is very happy.<\/p> <p>Most Senators have spoken about the welfare package and various aspects of it.  Some referred to the living alone allowance.  We are aware that people receiving that allowance, who are mainly pensioners and people with disabilities, will receive their increase.  That is very important.<\/p> <p>The provision relating to the islands shows that the three parties in government, namely, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, have an all-island approach, encompassing all people in all sectors.  The very fact that we have increased the island allowance is important.  There are 600 people living on offshore islands.  That is a significant number.  The allowance will be very well received.<\/p> <p>I will refer to one or two more issues before I conclude, the first being the removal of the earning limit in respect of the one-parent family payment.  Currently, when a lone parent's earnings exceed &euro;425 per week, the entitlement to the one-parent family payment is lost.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eugene Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The change in the Bill, which is very good, is very welcome.  At times, quite a number of one-parent families struggle and we should remember that.  I am not one of these people who goes to criticise them.  Many of them have tried very hard to do the best for their children in challenging circumstances.  This is the type of measure I like to see dealt with and I welcome it very much.<\/p><p>The increase in the carer's support grant has been spoken about by many people.  It is fair to say we always really need to be making improvements for carers.  This has been mentioned by many people and I welcome the change the Minister has made and the increase provided for by the Government.  It is important that we look after such vulnerable people.<\/p><p>The previous speaker made a very good point about the fuel allowance.  I will write to the Minister about other suggestions I have on the fuel allowance, to which we might be able to make changes.  This would be important because a complaint I probably get most is from people who feel they should get that particular allowance but do not because of the current regulations.  All I ask is that when I write to the Minister she will take a look at it.  I know she will.<\/p><p>In general, this has been a very good package in difficult and challenging times and I commend the Minister.  The way the staff have dealt with the thousands upon thousands of representations from Oireachtas Members and local authority members has been extraordinary.  I want to express my thanks again to the Minister and her staff for doing this.  As did previous speakers, I also did so at committee.  The staff have been a major help.  For many of the people with queries the situation was simplified for them by staff and that is really appreciated.  Sometimes in social welfare it is a case of us and them but what has happened in recent months in particular is that staff have more than stepped up to the mark with this level of co-operation.  Quite a number of members of the public have mentioned to me how easy it was to deal with the staff.  I have found them to be absolutely extraordinarily caring and helpful in doing everything they could to sort out issues for people.

I compliment the Minister in particular on a personal level for the amount of work she does and the way she deals with us as representatives.  She gets back to us incredibly quickly.  She is the most consistent Minister in answering the phone and getting back to us as quickly as possible.  For someone who is a new public representative, it is very much appreciated.<\/p> <p>As almost everyone has said, the Department has been put under immense pressure for the past nine months.  The Minister's predecessor, Senator Regina Doherty, did phenomenal work at the start of the pandemic and the Minister has taken it on.  We were at a stage where we had 1.3 million people receiving either the pandemic unemployment payment or a jobseeker's payment.  The Department was able to facilitate this and work through it although it all happened suddenly.  It was not like previous recessions in which people gradually lost their jobs, it was overnight.  I compliment the work the Department has done.  Everyone has said it and everyone feels the exact same way.  It has been a phenomenal achievement.  Everyone focuses on the Department of Health and the Department of Finance for obvious reasons but one of the biggest strains this pandemic has caused has certainly been to the Department of Social Protection.<\/p> <p>I will not go into too much detail because many people have raised many measures they welcome, such as the fuel allowance increase and the living alone allowance increase of &euro;5.  Although it is &euro;5, people really welcome it and it does mean a lot of them.  It is an acknowledgement that we understand they need support and we are supporting them.  The disability allowance increased by &euro;20 from &euro;120 to &euro;140.  This is important and it is another statement that we want to support people.  The carer's support grant has increased by &euro;150 from &euro;1,700 to &euro;1,850.  This is very welcome in the community.  Councillor Richie Molloy in Clonmel does an awful lot of work for family carers in Tipperary.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Garret Ahearn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is always a need for more support but certainly it is a large increase and it is very welcome.<\/p><p>I do not know whether other Senators touched on this but I have an interest in it from my perspective.  I want to acknowledge the increase in the parental leave benefit from two weeks to five weeks, an increase of three weeks.  There have been issues with getting it implemented and I compliment the work the Minister has done to make it happen.  People will now be able to take the extra three weeks' parental leave from the start of 2021 although the payment will not be made until the start of April.  Parents who have had children in the past 12 months will now be able to take leave.  They thought they might have been able to take only two weeks but now will have a total of five weeks' parental leave.  It is a very important statement by the Government that we support families and parents and that we support the structure of giving parents and guardians as much time as possible with their children at the very early stage of their lives.  The statement made by increasing the leave from two weeks to five weeks, with financial support from the Government, is hugely welcome.<\/p><p>We could go through many measures to welcome and acknowledge them but I will not do so.  It is a very good budget.  To think we are putting &euro;25 billion into the Department of Social Protection is phenomenal and the responsibility for the Department is huge.

Like all Members of the House, I meet people regularly through my constituency work who absolutely depend on their weekly social welfare payment.  We are coming to the end of what has been an extraordinarily difficult year and the scale of the supports the Government has put in place this year is unprecedented but they were absolutely needed.  Between Covid and Brexit we simply have not been able to do everything we wanted to do but in the circumstances we are in we have sought to target the resources where they are needed most.  The measures in the Bill will seek to make the social protection system work better for people who are unemployed, pensioners, carers, people with disabilities and lone parents.<\/p> <p>I thank all of the Members for the tributes and thanks to the staff and I will certainly pass them on to the staff in the Department and the wider social welfare staff up and down the length and breadth of the country.

Senators Lombard, Boylan, Kyne and Murphy all mentioned the islands.  I had the pleasure of visiting Arranmore during the summer.  The previous year I was at a wedding on Clare Island.  Even though I did not have responsibility at that stage I took the opportunity to speak to some of the local people on both occasions.  There are certainly challenges when people are living on an island.  The one that struck home for me is that when young people living on Arranmore want to go to the cinema, my goodness they really have to make the effort.  They have to get a boat then a car and then drive the whole way to Letterkenny.  I know this is to help certain categories of people on social welfare payments but I am very conscious that the islands are part of the whole country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Just because one must get on a boat to reach them does not mean that we should forget about them.

Senator Craughwell also tabled an amendment that, unfortunately, I cannot accept but I will certainly give it consideration and will ask my officials to look at it.  I agree with the Senators that some Senators and Deputies with young families who lost their seats earlier this year have been unable to get a job, possibly due to Covid, so have been left with no income.  Regardless of what party they belong to, that is a very tough situation for people who have worked extremely hard and cannot even sign on for credits.  People who lose their seats receive a severance payment, which must be considered when looking at the issue.  The matter should be referred to an Oireachtas committee for consideration because whatever recommendations, and Senator Craughwell has a Private Members' Bill-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#VV00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I called for a rapporteur's report to be prepared by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#WW00200","speaker":"1645"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":134,"content":"<p>We need to consider the matter using an Oireachtas committee with which I am happy to engage and lend my support.  However, it is important that the issue has cross-party support.<\/p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Warfield and Wall raised the issue of the pensions commission and the pension age.  The pensions commission has been set up and is comprised of 11 very capable people from various backgrounds, particularly employer groups, business groups and pension experts.  The commission has met three times.  It has a huge body of work to do and I hope that it will be able to report to me in June.  I have given the commission terms of reference to consider the State pension in its entirety because we must consider the impact that it has, both on those who retire now and especially young people who will retire at some stage in the future.  Interestingly, a Deputy asked the chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council last week about the possibility of reducing the pension age to 65 years.  The chairman was very clear about the impact such a move would have on the young people of today, which we must bear in mind.  It is important that the young people of today enjoy the same benefits as those who retire today so we need to make sure that we consider the intergenerational issue.  I am satisfied that the pensions commission will consider of the different aspects and make recommendations that take account of everybody's interests both young and old.  <\/p> <p>I have considered the issue concerning payments to 65-year-olds.  I will introduce regulations that will formally remove the current requirement for people to sign on.  The administrative practice has been in place whereby people do not have to sign on and just fill up one application form.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People do not have to sign on.  They do not currently have to stand in dole queues.  They do not have to be actively seeking work and they will receive a payment of &euro;203 per week for 12 months.  I am now signing off regulations that formalise the arrangement that we currently have in place that was introduced a good number of years ago.  For people who had worked all of their lives, it was demeaning for them to have to apply for the jobseeker's allowance so this issue has been dealt with and the current arrangement has been in place for some time. <\/p><p>Many Senators mentioned the fuel allowance.  It has been increased but we need to consider it in a broader sense.  There are a number of supports available through the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications that will help people to make the necessary changes to make their houses more energy efficient.  A lot of grants are available and we are considering the retrofit scheme as well.  I am happy to engage with the Senators on the issue and I know that it has been raised here several times.  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through the combination of supports that I have mentioned, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency and the energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  Indeed, one of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling house through proper building and household insulation so the warmer homes scheme, which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, is designed to do that.  I take on board the points that have been made and I will consider the fuel allowance in the context of next year's budget.<\/p><p>The next issue is the pandemic unemployment payment for people over 66 years.  Last March, when the previous Government established the PUP, people aged over 66 years were never entitled to it because the PUP is there to provide a basic level of income for people to live on.  The &euro;350 rate is the equivalent of the jobseeker's payment plus a qualified adult.  A person in receipt of a contributory pension of &euro;248 will get a qualified adult payment of between &euro;165 and &euro;222.  Depending on his or her partner's age that could mean a person receives up to &euro;470 per week overall, which is well in excess of the top PUP rate of &euro;350.  Of course we would love to be able to give everybody more money but we must target our resources, which I am sure Senators will appreciate.  The PUP was created to look after the people who have no income because they have lost their jobs.  To date, we have spent almost &euro;4.5 billion on PUP and it has served as a safety net for hundreds of thousands of people during the pandemic.  I appreciate that there are people who receive a pension but continue to work and are still in business.  The restart grant is available to them if they own their own premises.  <\/p><p>The next issue is the means test for the carer's allowance.  I wish to point out that the means test for a carer's allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system in that &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or co-habitating is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  This means that a couple can earn in the region of &euro;37,500 yet qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am informed that some 92% of the recipients of carer's allowance have no means or means of less than &euro;760 per week.<\/p><p>I will address the broader issue of carers.  They have had a particularly difficult year with Covid because they have not been able to avail of some of the day services or the supports that are normally available.   As a recognition of that, I wanted to improve the carer's support grant.  The role of the Department is to provide a basic income; it is not our job to pay people for the important job they do.  In terms of carers, that also involves the Department of Health, which carries out an important role.  The Department of Health has a responsibility for the national carers' strategy so there needs to be a joined-up approach.  I said in the D&aacute;il that we should consider both sectoral committees coming together to do a study on the role of carers and how we can support them in the fantastic work they do.  We know some carers have a greater burden than others and we are well aware of those situations.  That is something we need to have a discussion on and I am happy to engage with the committee in looking at that issue.  We all realise there are those who are doing it 24-7 and those who have a less demanding role.  I am happy to work on that.<\/p><p>We have cleared most of the arrears.  There are 6,000 cases remaining and we are working to get them cleared as quickly as we can.  We are hoping to have most of them done by the end of the year.  The main reason arrears accumulated was all the information was not provided.  We wanted to get payments to them immediately and we went back to them when we had an opportunity to get more information.  That has all been processed.  Last week, there was a lot of money paid out for arrears.  The majority of it is done but there are some that we are working on.<\/p><p>JobPath was raised by Senator Warfield.  The average cost for JobPath services at the moment is &euro;870 per jobseeker for a 12-month engagement.  It is important to acknowledge that JobPath is only one part of the jigsaw.  We have local employment services and Intreo offices.  There are approximately 200,000 people on the live register.  The number on the PUP is well down this week, thank goodness.  It is down by more than 42,000 on last week so there are approximately 306,000 people on the PUP.  Now is not the time to take away any of those job activation measures because people need the support to reskill, take up other jobs or help them in any way we can to get back into employment.  People want to get back to work.  JobPath is only one part of the jigsaw and I am expanding the local employment services and job clubs and these contracts are being extended into next year.  I have spoken to the local development companies because they play a big role in the local employment services.  We are working with those as well.   <\/p><p>Senator Burke raised the issue of protection for sole traders in the event of closure of their business.  This area of responsibility now falls under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He suggested that family homes should be excluded from the clawback for redundancy payments made by the State.  I am happy to take up with him on the individual case he was referring to but the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for redundancy. <\/p><p>Senator Boyhan commended on the Department and I thank him for his kind words.  The Department is here to help people and we are not trying to put obstacles in their way.  That is important to say.  The Senator raised an issue related to people aged between 18 and 22 who are in full-time education.  \"Yes, from 1 January\", is the answer to his question.  He mentioned carers and I have covered that.  I have covered the pensions commission as well.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Heather Humphreys:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2308\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Senator Dolan and Senator Buttimer mentioned carers as well.  This time last year we were in full employment and we were in a different world.  Having said that, I am confident that 2021 will be the year of the recovery.  It is important we give people hope and there is no reason it cannot be.  Many supports have been paid out and I hope people will spend them locally and support their local businesses.  We know the value of the local shop from when we were in the depths of this lockdown and one was able to go and get what one needed there.  We should not forget about them as we move on.  <\/p><p>Senators Currie and Cummins raised the hot school meals programme.  As the Senators said, it has been expanded.  I have expanded the numbers and increased the budget.  There is no doubt that hot meals are important to children.  As a mother of two who spent years trying to think of innovative ways to get them to eat their cold lunch and comply with the school healthy-eating policy, I assure Senators that I understand that.  I even tried sending food flasks but they were too awkward to carry so that did not work either.  I thought if they had something warm it would be good for them on a cold day.  I understand the value of the hot school meals programme.  We are expanding it and will look at it in time, in conjunction with the Department of Education.<\/p><p>Senator Cummins referred to the role of the Department of Social Protection and the changing of that name.  It was right to change it because our role is to protect and provide a basic income for people.  We will look at the disablement benefit the Senator raised and I will talk to him about that case.<\/p><p>Senator Murphy spoke about the entertainment industry.  He is very familiar with that industry and has been supportive of it in many ways.  I thank him for his comments and I was glad to be able to accept the amendment in the D&aacute;il whereby those in the industry are allowed to earn &euro;960 every two months before it impacts on their PUP.  That has been warmly welcomed.<\/p><p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the increase in parental leave.  That is welcome and the legislation is under way.  We hope to have it in operation as soon as we can.  The reason for the delay in the payment is that we have to write the computer system again.  There has been a great deal of pressure on our systems in terms of adapting them quickly to pay the PUP.  Then we had the Christmas bonus and then we had the arrears.  We are working on that and we will get it done as soon as the legislation is through.  People can still take the leave and they will get the payment once the system is up and running.<\/p><p>I think I have covered most things and, once again, I thank Senators for their contributions.  I look forward to coming back to the Seanad on Committee Stage.  At the end of the day, we are all on the same page here.  We all want to alleviate poverty where we can, to support people into sustainable employment and provide a high quality service to people throughout the country and throughout their lives.  As I said earlier, the staff of the Department of Social Protection have done that this year.  I thank Senators again and will see them on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#WW00300","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1607954400,"counter":138,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":139,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#ZZ00225","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":140,"content":"<p>Next Wednesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2020121400002#ZZ00237","speaker":"1666"},{"type":"speech","time":1607954400,"counter":141,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?
