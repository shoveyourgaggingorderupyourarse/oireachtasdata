To be fair to her, in her speech she made it clear that she did not seek to renegotiate the backstop or the UK-wide customs union she had sought in the first instance but rather she was seeking reassurance and clarity as to when or if ever it would have to come into play.  Overall, however, the impact of yesterday's decision by the Prime Minister has been to create greater uncertainty and political instability, particularly uncertainty as to the future and the particular nature of Brexit that will ultimately emerge.<\/p>  <p>  While many seasoned commentators, and I include myself among them, felt at the end of the day that a no-deal Brexit would not emerge, I believe we can be no longer be certain of that.  The scale of the opposition to the deal yesterday was quite significant in itself.  Therefore, a significant period of political and economic instability and uncertainty lies ahead.  It is in that context that we as a country must be prepared for any eventuality.  We have been saying for quite some time that it is our view, in accordance with Government data and information, that the country is not prepared for Brexit, particularly for a no-deal Brexit.  The briefings to the House have confirmed, for example, that  the majority of firms likely to be strongly impacted do not even have a Brexit plan in place.  Nearly 40% of key exporters will fear severe difficulties at the exchange rate to which sterling fell this week.  Half of exporting sectors have taken limited preparatory steps with Irish owned businesses being the most exposed.<\/p><p>Government financial aid is delayed and is so far having a negligible impact.  One can go through the various schemes that Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and others have put forward.  The take-up has been very low.  One can look at that in a number of ways.  I know the Taoiseach's perspective.  It suggests that people were hoping everything would be all right on the night and that there was a lack of real engagement on behalf of many.  Has there been discussion with the EU about the utilisation of cohesion funding and structural funding as potential state aids to help small and medium enterprises, SMEs, that rely heavily on the British market, especially the agrifood sector?  The T&aacute;naiste outlined this morning that he was bringing a memo to Government.  He called it central scenario planning.  Will the Taoiseach commit to the House that he will publish the plans about the country's readiness and preparation for Brexit?  The public deserves to know about the content of the plans and their implications.  The success of any preparation plans depends on buy-in from all concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100003#A00200","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544537100,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  We should not forget how we got here.  The United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union and its Government set out some hard red lines, that it would leave the customs union and the Single Market, that there would be no freedom of movement, and that they would not accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.  The agreement which we came to, after almost two years of negotiation, is supported by 28 Governments.  We came to that agreement by drawing it around the red lines set by the UK Government.  No other agreement can do that.  The UK-wide backstop is there at the request of the UK Government, as the Deputy rightly pointed out.  Our original proposal was for something different, with a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which would not apply to Great Britain.  Before the UK set out its red lines, there were other options such as \"Norway plus\", where the United Kingdom would remain in the Single Market and customs union but not in the European Union itself.  The agreement we have come to was crafted around the UK's own red lines and contains elements that it wanted, specifically a backstop that would apply on a UK-wide basis and not just to Northern Ireland, which was the original proposal of Ireland and the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  It is essential to point out that the backstop is not just an Irish issue.  It is a European issue too.  It is there to give us the enduring guarantee that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but it is also to protect the Single Market and make sure that the open Irish Border does not cause the European Single Market to be contaminated.  That is why there is resolute and overwhelming European support that the backstop has to remain part of a withdrawal agreement.  It is not just an Irish issue but an issue for Europe too, and the integrity of the Single Market which we are all part of.<\/p>  <p>  We have always based our plans on a central case scenario, which is that there would be a deal.  We have been doing contingency planning for a no deal scenario.  We now need to increase the contingency planning to execution for no deal.  That includes putting in place measures for both the central case scenario and the no deal scenario.  That involves acceleration of the recruitment of customs officers.  We have 200 in the recruitment process already with a panel of 3,000, so we can do that.  It also includes recruitment of veterinary officers and health officials.  It means putting in place infrastructure in our ports and airports, specifically Dublin and Rosslare, and introducing enabling legislation.  Some of that will be done through Brussels and some will be done here in the Oireachtas in the first quarter.  Some 70 Commission notes have been published already.  We will publish information as we go and will provide briefings to Opposition parties.<\/p>  <p>  Firms which do not have action plans should develop them.  Those that have action plans should begin to implement them.  There is Government support, whether through seminars, loans or advice.  We have had discussions with the European Commission about state aid and what state aid may be available to companies in the case of a no deal scenario.  Those discussions are already under way and we have some proposals under consideration as to what could be offered in state aid.  That would not kick in unless it was absolutely necessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100004#B00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1544537400,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Will the Taoiseach publish the central case scenario plan, which is a terrible name for a plan?

There is a view that people should be told the terrible implications of Brexit that might cause undue alarm and panic.  People are sensible.  If we want them to buy-in and engage they should know what the implications are.

As we are all aware, this heightens the prospect of a no deal scenario or a crash out Brexit, which nobody in their right senses wishes to see happen.  I know that this matter was discussed at Cabinet this morning and that the T&aacute;naiste has brought forward a paper.  It is important that the Government puts the maximum possible information into the public domain regarding the specifics of its sectoral contingency plans.<\/p>  <p>  There is a bigger issue.  Whatever the contingencies in the here and now for individual sectors, there remains questions around no return to a hard border, no hardening of the Border, the protection of citizens' rights and the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement.  Those matters, it should be remembered, are the reasons a backstop was crafted in the first instance.  I have repeatedly made it clear to Mrs. Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, that in the event of a crash out or a no deal Brexit it will be incumbent on her to put the question of the constitutional future of the North to the people by way of a referendum.  I believe we are on course to such a referendum in any event, but a crash or no deal scenario makes it an immediate prospect.  It is time for the Taoiseach and the Government to articulate that same position.<\/p><p>If the people of the North are to be disregarded and have their futures toyed with by a British Parliament that does not have a clue what it is doing and has absolutely no regard for this country, they must have their say.  This is a reasonable position.  It is the only sustainable and serious position and it is one that all parties in the D&aacute;il should support.<\/p> <p> The European Council agreed in April 2017 that all of the island would be afforded membership of the European Union in the event of national reunification.  Amid all the toing and froing, the chaos at Westminster and talk of hard borders, soft borders, deals and no deals, it is a fact that uniting our country would end the need for a backstop, definitively and permanently.  The debate on unity is well under way, particularly in the North.  Notwithstanding sectoral contingencies, what is the big contingency plan?  My suggestion is that it should be the Government preparing contingencies and plans for a constitutional transition and a unity referendum.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100005#C01200","speaker":"1239","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544538000,"counter":22,"content":"<p>To answer the Deputy's first question, we have no difficulty making plans public at the right time and as they are developed.  However, it should be borne in mind that contingency plans happen at two levels.  There are the contingency plans happening at European level, led by the Commission, and those that are specific to Ireland, which are led by the Government.  The plans in Brussels will not be finalised until the middle of January but we are happy to make them public as we move forward.  Indeed, it will be necessary to make them public because it will require the recruitment of staff, which must be made public, infrastructure at ports and airports, which will have to be tendered for and thus be made public, and legislation.  In some cases it will be simple legislation to add words such as \"and the United Kingdom\" beside the European Union and to make exceptions for the United Kingdom in certain circumstances.  Again, that must be made public because we will be asking the Oireachtas to enact that legislation.  It will also involve business supports, many of which are already well known.  Additional supports around state aid might be necessary after 28 March.  These things must be done in consort with Brussels.  They must all be done together and they must not contradict each other.  We will be happy to make them available as time passes.  We have already briefed the Brexit stakeholder group, on which the Deputy's party is represented, on much of this so there will not be many surprises.<\/p>  <p>  On the Deputy's central question, I disagree with her assessment.  I heard the Prime Minister's speech yesterday in the House of Commons in which she gave a robust defence of the backstop.  She accepts that there must be a backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement, that there can be no withdrawal agreement without one and that a backstop is necessary to give us the insurance policy we need whereby should Great Britain ever pursue a hard Brexit, there would not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland as a consequence.  We have been at pains to emphasise all along that special arrangements for Northern Ireland where they relate to, for example, agriculture regulations, industrial products or goods are not constitutional matters.  At the heart of the Good Friday Agreement is an acceptance that we only pursue our political objectives in Britain and Ireland by peaceful means, that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom until the people there say otherwise and that there are special arrangements for Northern Ireland.  The fact that there are special arrangements for Northern Ireland reflects its unique history and geography.  They are not a constitutional threat.  The Deputy introducing demands for Irish unity and a Border poll into the debate at this time is disruptive and destructive to trying to achieve what we seek, which is ratification of this agreement by the House of Commons in January.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100006#D00200","speaker":"1236"},{"type":"speech","time":1544538000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I do not know if the Taoiseach missed what happened at Westminster.

The issue relates to Tipperary town.  On 24 October and 20 November, thousands of men, women and their children, young and old, marched through Tipperary town to ask local government and national Government to help to put the place back on track.  I attended both of those marches and I was struck by the genuine plea for help from decent people.  They want help to rejuvenate a once great town.  People were on the streets protesting at the years of accumulated neglect.  They feel disillusioned and angry with the authorities of the State.  Based on a Pobal report that drew on the 2016 census, it is a fact that the town has been identified as disadvantaged.  The startling figures for unemployment in Tipperary are a damning indictment of Government and those which preceded it.  There is 31% unemployment among males and 23% among females.  When these figures are compared with the national average of 5.6% one can see how big is the problem.  Some 20 years ago, Tipperary town was one of Ireland's leading market towns.  Despite its current problems, it still has an enormous amount to offer and to work with.  It is imperative that the inner relief roads are built as a priority to get the heavy vehicles off the main street, which will soon be completely resurfaced.  The business community requires that its members' financial situation be taken into account when it comes to rates, levies and charges.<\/p>  <p>  The one principle lacking in Tipperary is leadership with a vision for the future.  All of our national agencies are aware of the problems in Tipperary and some of these agencies, including the county council, have available resources to assist the town but there is no overall plan that can be implemented.  Efforts are disjointed and are not co-ordinated.  Decision-making is choked by bureaucracy and stifled by the round-robin system within our State agencies.  A new approach involving joined-up thinking is required.<\/p><p>We need a strategy and a plan to reinvigorate Tipperary town.  The five primary schools in the town need extra resources for their pupils to tackle the cycle of disadvantage.  I compliment and thank the Minister, Deputy McHugh, for his recent initiative in that regard.  I ask the Taoiseach to nominate a figure with professional experience and competence to establish and lead a dedicated working group.  This individual would bring together all relevant State agencies, local business and interest groups and would be capable of delivering a renewal plan for the town.  What Tipperary needs is a new policy, new ideas and investment.

I am very much aware of the protests that have occurred in recent months.  A turnout of 2,000 or 3,000 people to protest in what is a relatively small town is a huge number and reflects the depth of feeling that people in Tipperary town have about the decline of their town over the years.  It is a concern that everyone on these benches very much shares.  The Government has been engaged on this issue.  As the Deputy knows and, indeed, at his invitation, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, met the principals of the five schools in Tipperary town to see what could be achieved in terms of additional supports, particularly recognising the disadvantage that exists in Tipperary town but also the influx of new communities, often people who do not have English as their first language, and the additional needs that they have.  In terms of unemployment, while it is high, it is falling.  Since it peaked in 2012, unemployment in Tipperary town has fallen by 52%, by more than half, and youth unemployment has fallen by two thirds, by 68%.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland is also engaged.  There are now 11 IDA Ireland companies in Tipperary, employing 3,600 people, and there are 123 Enterprise Ireland, EI, client companies.  Funding has been provided directly in recent months for Tipperary town, including a &euro;97,500 grant for the town centre plaza project to upgrade the town centre, which the Deputy mentioned.  Funding has also been provided for Tipperary town football club and other sporting clubs in the area.

I think it is fair to say that Government has been engaged at least in certain aspects of what is needed in Tipperary town.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that a new approach is needed and that a plan is needed for the town but that has to be locally led.  There are lots of areas of need in the country and many pockets of disadvantage, including many in my own constituency.  The right approach with few exceptions - in fact, only one exception because of the number of murders in the north-east inner city - is one that is local authority led and bottom up.  A very good approach that I think could be modelled is what is being done in the Inchicore-Kilmainham area in Dublin or what is being done in the Balbriggan area under the remit of Fingal County Council, which is for the local authority to identify somebody to develop a plan and then to engage with Government on it.

However, Ireland is actually going backwards.  Our commitments require us to reduce our emissions by 1 million tonnes per year, but instead they have increased by 2.1 million tonnes per year.<\/p>  <p>  Yesterday we got our latest climate change report card, the climate change performance index.  For the second year in a row - twice under the watch of the present Taoiseach - we are ranked bottom of the class.  Ireland is the worst performer on climate action in the EU.  It is embarrassing, disgraceful and shameful.<\/p>  <p>  Despite all the years of talk and Government announcements about the need to transition to a low-carbon economy, it has been a case of more talk and glitzy announcements than any real action.  The report stated: \"The long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well-below-2&deg;C pathway results in a very low rating for Ireland&rsquo;s national policy performance\".  That is basically a technical way of saying that Ireland may talk the talk and spin the spin, but it certainly does not walk the walk, which is the responsibility of the Taoiseach.<\/p>  <p>  Leaders must lead and the people do not want to see our country continually trailing in climate action.  It is an unfair reflection of their concerns.  The people are way ahead of Government on this.  The Government is out of sync with Irish and global concerns and the demands for real climate action.  It is all well and good to produce plans, roadmaps and recommendations, but they are of no use if they are not followed and if they do not have cold hard figures to back them up.  If the Government were serious about climate action, why would it launch Project Ireland 2040 when it has not been climate proofed?  Everything in the plan is wonderfully vague when it comes to climate impacts.  Whenever I or one of my colleagues on this side of the House asks the Taoiseach or anyone in government for information on how they plan to tackle climate change, we get the same response: that &euro;1 in every &euro;5 under the national development plan is being spent on climate action initiatives.  However, the climate action committee has been told that 60% of that &euro;1 in &euro;5 is already committed energy expenditure, meaning that the &euro;1 in &euro;5 appears to be a sham.<\/p>  <p>  Today I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the other &euro;4 in &euro;5.  How does he know what the impact of our greenhouse gas emissions of non-climate related spending under Project Ireland 2040 will be when there are no real numbers in the plan?  There are no projected emission reductions, no identification of any real climate proofing.  I ask the Taoiseach to give me the number for our projected emission reductions under Project Ireland 2040.  I do not want vague plans and more announcements today; I want real numbers.  If the Taoiseach does not have the numbers, does he intend to do that analysis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100009#G00200","speaker":"1242"},{"type":"speech","time":1544539200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Only a few days ago the Environmental Protection Agency released its report on greenhouse gas emissions from Ireland in 2017, last year.

It is for that exact reason that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has been tasked with developing an all-of-Government climate action plan.  That is being developed at present and will be ready in the first quarter of next year.  It will follow a similar model to the one he pursued with his action plan for education, which, everyone accepts, has helped to bring about vast improvements in education in recent years, and the Action Plan for Jobs, which helped to get us where we are today, moving from high unemployment to almost full employment.<\/p>  <p>  We estimate that the implementation of Project Ireland 2040 will bring us approximately one third of the way to meeting our greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.  It is only part of the solution and other solutions will also be required, including regulation, investment in technologies, taxation and behavioural change.  Nobody is suggesting that Project Ireland 2040 on its own will solve climate change.  We acknowledge that some projects may actually contribute to climate change, including, for example, some of the road projects listed.

It certainly will not do so when it has not even been climate-proofed, which is the main point.  The EPA's recent report states that emissions have decreased.  I am glad the Taoiseach accepts that this is due to the mild winter.  Another reason is the reduction in fuel tourism because of Brexit's impact on the pound.  The underlying trend is that we are still way off target but at least the Taoiseach has not tried to take credit for the weather, which would be a whole new level of spin.  The recent reductions are certainly not due to Government action.  We are 3 million tonnes off where we promised to be under European effort-sharing agreements and at the current carbon market prices, this would cost us some &euro;60 million.  That cost is only going to increase, year on year.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of plans and the all-of-Government plan to which the Taoiseach referred, at this stage people are suffering from Government climate action spin fatigue and plan fatigue.  Under the national mitigation plan for this year, only 21 of the 40 actions have been completed.  As I said, the national development plan has not been climate proofed.  The national energy and climate plan must be submitted to Europe by the end of the month but, as recently as last week, Departments were unable to outline any additional measure being undertaken to close the emissions gap.<\/p>  <p>  The current national development plan is not fit for purpose.  Restoring Ireland's reputation will require that the new national energy and climate action plan replaces Project Ireland 2040.  This should include a new land use element which commits us to a new future for Irish farms, forestry and bogs.  It should promise a radically different transport system which promotes walking, cycling and public transport ahead of road construction.  Of course, we also need to divest from fossil fuels.  This would ignite our economy but it requires leadership.  Everybody matters in making this just transition, which is why my party has published a just transition Bill.  If it can be done, it will only be done if the Taoiseach and his Government changes track and gets serious about this.

I reiterate that in the past few days the issue of the impact of historical ownership models within the health sector has come to light in the context of Holles Street.  For the sake of moving forward with critical improvements to women's healthcare in Dublin in particular, but also throughout the country, I hope this will definitely be resolved immediately.  I put this forward not from ideological perspective but from a governance and capacity perspective.  It points to a failure in recent years to have a more structured and comprehensive approach to patronage and ownership in an era where religious groups no longer have the capacity to effectively manage institutions.  Years were wasted on an adversarial approach where arbitrary targets were announced.  Progress basically dried up as we know, particularly in education.  We had all the talk of divestment and nothing happened as a result.  Has the Taoiseach proposed any new systematic engagement with the churches about their roles within education and health and the wider social services?<\/p><p>As we talk about constructing new hospitals, where existing sites are sold, the funding should only go to new hospitals.  We are in danger of losing many positive contributions if we do not have a more systematic approach.  Furthermore, the churches, to be fair, were pillars of the peace process and were able to maintain a dialogue with the men and women of violence even when they were at their destructive and sectarian worst.  Nothing could have been achieved without brave members of religious communities who worked night and day for peace.  In this context, it has to be a deep concern that many religious leaders today are very worried about the direction of events in Northern Ireland.  They believe that the political deadlock imposed by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in is dramatically escalating tensions and that a dangerous atmosphere is developing.  Has the Taoiseach had any recent meetings with religious leaders about their concerns about Northern Ireland?  Has he sought their co-operation to try to find a pathway forward to the restoration of democratic politics and a more energised civic dialogue within Northern Ireland, which has been suppressed for far too long?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100017#P03000","speaker":"1224","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544543700,"counter":174,"content":"<p>The new National Maternity Hospital to be housed at St. Vincent's has been mired in controversy.  Public opinion is clearly that it must be owned and operated by the State.  Some 19 months have passed since the Sisters of Charity announced that they were to end their involvement in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Last week, the Minister for Health confirmed that the withdrawal of the order from St. Vincent's had yet to be finalised.  Alarmingly, the Minister acknowledged that he has yet to ensure that the hospital will remain in public ownership or that its board will include a public interest director.  Over the weekend, as the Taoiseach may know, hundreds of women gathered in Dublin to voice their concerns about the ownership and ethos of our new maternity hospital.  Hours later, Archbishop Diarmuid Martin stated that citizens do not have to obey laws that are contrary to their Catholic faith, an assertion which I, as a Catholic, found alarming and extraordinary.  The Taoiseach can understand the heightened concerns that women and their families have regarding their healthcare.  It is clear that the January deadline, as committed to, for the provision of abortion services will not be met and we have the Archbishop of Dublin publicly encouraging a revolt by anti-choice medical professionals with regard to the referral provisions in the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill.  Dr. Rhona Mahony, as she ends her term as master of Holles Street, is concerned that the new maternity hospital project is in danger of falling apart.  Will the new maternity hospital be owned in full by the State?  Will the Taoiseach reassure women and their families that there will be no involvement at board, management or ownership level by the Sisters of Charity or any other religious order?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100018#Q00200","speaker":"1239"},{"type":"speech","time":1544543700,"counter":175,"content":"<p>I am asking this question on behalf of Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Last Wednesday morning, I had the opportunity to ask the Minister for Health the same question about ownership of the new National Maternity Hospital and I got no answer.  I do not think it is good enough that the public, especially women, are, until the 11th hour, when the deal was supposed to be signed off on on Friday, not being given information.  Some 25 months ago, discussions commenced on the ownership of the hospital and we still do not have accurate information.  I was one of the people at the protest on O'Connell Street.  I was not there for the fun of it.  It was a cold, wet day but I was there because the answers being given here by the Minister for Health are not acceptable.  They are not answers.  Women are genuinely concerned about the future of maternity care for many reasons, not least the legacy reasons of the role of the church in healthcare.  The Taoiseach has said on many occasions, as has the Minister, Deputy Harris, that he wants to see the full separation of church and State in health and education.  Now is an opportunity for him to ensure that happens.  Will he guarantee here today that what will probably cost the State at least &euro;350 million, not an untidy figure, will belong to the people and will be governed and run in a purely secular manner that can guarantee women in the post-repeal era 21st century maternity care?

The Taoiseach and Minister for Health have consistently refused to come out completely clearly and show how that will be done by the State.  The nuns have announced that they have stood back but none of us is clear as to whether or not the commitments they have given are adequate.

Many new schools are being built around the country.  Many are community national schools, Educate Together schools or are under education and training boards, ETBs.  Some are under relatively new religious patronage bodies such as Le Ch&eacute;ile or Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  These new builds on new sites are publicly owned by the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a divestment programme, which is slow but it is happening.  That relates to a number of locations around the country where the parents of pre-school children are being surveyed and polled about what type of patronage they would like to have for their local school.  In time, that will lead to quite a number of diocesan national schools being transferred to the patronage of the local ETB.<\/p>  <p>  In healthcare, a former chief civil servant in the European Commission, Catherine Day, has prepared a report on patronage and voluntarism in our health service.  I do not think many people in this House will dispute, with regard to voluntarism in the health service, that many hospitals around the country, including the Mater, St. Vincent's or the National Children's Hospital, formerly on Harcourt Street, or the Mercy in Cork, were founded by religious bodies or charities, often being paid for, built and staffed by them and they did the country a lot of service.

The Minister for Health is bringing together two existing hospitals on the same site.  These are hospitals with their own legal personalities, boards and staff and, in some case, their own debts and various other liabilities.  It is important to get the governance and ownership right.  It is intended that the hospital will be owned by the Government and that any procedure or service that is legal in this State, including tubal ligation, abortion, IVF, will be available in that hospital, the law of the land will apply, and the ethical principles that will apply are those of the Medical Council and medical ethics not any other ethics.  The hospital will also have its own board and governance separate from St. Vincent's Hospital but the hospitals will require a degree of integration.

The Central Bank has said it is already impacting on key parts of the economy.  The budget documentation issued by the Minister for Finance two months ago states that the fiscal situation is exposed to a failure to achieve an orderly Brexit.  Nearly half of exports are to the United Kingdom and critical sectors have said they would face severe difficulties with the exchange rate that was reached yesterday.  The Government's data show that the majority of firms are simply not ready for Brexit.  Given the events of yesterday and the Taoiseach's statement that he has decided to ramp up preparations for a no deal scenario, something he has said many times previously but he has not done, can he tell us what the likely implications of a no deal scenario are for our economy next year?  If there is a failure to have a deal which comes into force at the end of March, what are the working assumptions of the impact of this on our economic and fiscal situation?  While the European Union has published a no deal guidance, as has the United Kingdom, there is no Irish specific guidance, or at least no such guidance that is publicly available.<\/p>  <p>  There are 108 days left until the Brexit day set down in UK legislation.  At what point will we see any of the no deal preparations which we are told are on their way and, in particular, the memorandum brought to the Cabinet today by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade?

However, the point I made on Leaders' Questions still stands - there must be a far more comprehensive and long lasting response in the event of a crash and that revolves around resolving the constitutional issue and removing the Border.<\/p>  <p>  In respect of the economy, the Taoiseach was questioned earlier about climate change.  The performance index published by the UN Climate Change Conference in Poland yesterday made grim reading.  We are ranked as the worst state in the European Union when it comes to addressing climate change.  According to that report we will miss our 2020 and 2030 climate change targets.  This will cost us.  It will cost the State in terms of environmental consequences, and missing our emissions and renewable energy target means the State will also face huge fines.  This is not acceptable.  We have moved beyond the point of taking small steps.  We need vision and action.  Ours is a small state in global terms but I believe this island can lead by example.  This means action being pursued cross-departmentally to tackle climate change.  A range of commitments have been made over the years to get to grips with our lacklustre performance but they have not been kept.<\/p>  <p>  First, is the climate change agenda central to the work of the economic committee?

Restrictions have been lifted by order of the Minister.  My question relates to planning and economics, because one cannot have one without the other.  Did the Department of the Taoiseach have discussions with NAMA at any stage?  Did it inform NAMA of the likely impact the lifting of height restrictions would have on any planning permission application that might be submitted by developers and, most importantly, on the value of sites that NAMA was selling?  When it discussed how the remaining sites and loans could be important to deal with the housing crisis and be utilised directly by State agencies to build social and affordable homes, was this just an example of NAMA gobbling up very lucrative lands in advance of the restrictions being lifted?  There are two sites where this took place.  One of them is in Dublin north docklands near Mayor Street on Castleforbes Road.<\/p><p>One of the last remaining prime development sites in the docklands was sold for &euro;110 million.  The planning that was granted for that site could be scrapped and they could go back to issue new planning.  If they had any sense they would.  This would mean that developers have gobbled up public land owned by NAMA at a very giveaway price.  I want to know if there were any discussions by the Minister or the Department with NAMA and with developers about this move to lift the restrictions on building height.

That information coincides with a report from the Economic Social Research Institute, ESRI, that says despite the Government pledging to cut taxes the Government's budget will actually leave households, and in particular the lower income households, paying more tax.  Lower income households include large numbers of younger people who are being absolutely stung for rising rents and who are beginning to feel that they will never be able to afford a property.

This is likely to be followed by a number of other countries, as indicated by the Chancellor in the United Kingdom and by Spain.  If they introduce the digital tax has there been any analysis of the impact of this measure on Ireland's tax base?  I would be interested in hearing it.

In the event of a hard Brexit are there contingency plans to increase the capacity of our main exporting ports, especially the ports of Dublin and Rosslare?  Will the Taoiseach clarify if the Government has plans to identify vessels that might be chartered in the event that the land bridge is so congested by the backlog in ports such as Dover that it would be useless to us?

No country has ever left the European Union before.  There have, however, been a number of analyses and I refer Deputies to the Copenhagen Economics report that was published a few months ago, which gives at least an estimate of what the impact will be in different scenarios including a no-deal scenario.<\/p>  <p>  No-deal preparations are not a big secret, nor are the central case plans.  As I explained earlier, they happen at two levels; at European level and at national level.  At the European level, 70 notices have been issued already and seminars are ongoing.  The seminars will continue until mid-January.  With regard to national level preparations we have had Brexit preparedness seminars also.  The preparations involve a number of elements including the hiring of staff such as customs' staff, veterinary inspectors for sanitary and phytosanitary controls, SPC, environmental health inspectors and property professionals.  The preparations include additional infrastructure at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Port.  It also involves a suite of legislation that we will have to put through the Houses of the Oireachtas in the first quarter of the year, some of which is very simple legislation and some very complicated.  IT systems and customs' training for business are already under way.  There are other planning measures too and we will be happy to publish those as we go along.  We are not going to publish Government memos but we are happy to make public the information as we go along.

I have already identified areas where some capital programmes are unlikely to spend their full allocation this year.  For example, while LEADER activity is ramping up and a healthy pipeline of projects has been approved, the programme will not require its full allocation this year.  I have been proactive in reallocating resources where possible.  For example, I have already expanded the community enhancement programme this year, increased investment in libraries, and provided additional support to fund the local improvement schemes, LIS.  I have also supported the development of Coillte trails, Tidy Towns, agricultural shows and men's shed organisations.  The progress being made with regard to payments is clear.  Almost &euro;35 million in capital expenditure was paid out in October and November.

I was delighted to announce the first group, totalling 18 projects, to be supported by the fund last month.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also continuing to support the many vibrant towns and villages across rural Ireland through a range of other schemes and supports.  The evidence of impact can be seen in growing opportunities for employment and improved quality of life across rural Ireland.  Of particular importance for those towns and villages most disadvantaged in terms of access to services are the CL&Aacute;R programme, the community enhancement programme, the town and village renewal scheme and the funding being provided to public libraries.<\/p><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Additionally, funding delivered through the community services programme, LEADER and SICAP provides supports tailored to the specific needs of individual areas.<\/p> <p> The Government is continuing to explore ways to sustain the viability of the post office network into the future.  In October last, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment launched a new Digital Assist pilot initiative with An Post.  Ten locations across the country will act as pilots for the provision of new services and I am delighted that my Department has been able to provide funding of &euro;80,000 for this programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100027#Z01200","speaker":"1334","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544549700,"counter":369,"content":"<p>The dismantling of the rural post office network continues across the country.  We lost two important post offices in south Kilkenny at Mullinavat and Glenmore, and another is to close within the next two months at Kilmoganny.

If it had the foresight to implement the recommendations contained in the Kerr report when it was furnished in 2016 regarding the need for additional services to be made available to post offices, places like Mullinavat and Glenmore would have had the chance to increase their footfall and maximise their commercial viability.

Among many other things which are of great concern to me and other Deputies are the significant underspending, the fact that fewer measures are actually being delivered to the community, that there was no single database, that many of the reporting requirements set out in the legislation were not met, that there was insufficient incentive to undertake dormant account measures and that there was no awareness or communication strategy with regard to selling this to the public.

The Cooley Peninsula was also included, on the basis of the serious difficulties caused in that area by foot and mouth disease.  The average population loss in the original CL&Aacute;R regions over the period 1926 to 1996 was 50%.  In 2006, an analysis of the 2002 census data was carried out by the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis, NIRSA, at Maynooth University and the programme was extended to include areas with an average population loss of 35% between 1926 and 2002. <\/p>  <p>  The CL&Aacute;R programme was closed for new applications in 2010.

As he knows, I have raised this issue a number of times since I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  There are only two counties outside of Dublin which are excluded from the CL&Aacute;R programme - Kildare and Wexford.  That is partially because the CL&Aacute;R programme is still based on the 2002 census.  We have had three censuses since then.  A number of areas in Wexford would have been eligible for the CL&Aacute;R programme but have been excluded because of the reliance on the 2002 census.  That has been deeply unfair to Wexford especially as it is consistently and unfortunately the third or fourth worst county in any assessment of disadvantage or socioeconomic assessment.  To be excluded from a source of income is quite unfortunate.<\/p>  <p>  To highlight another matter, CL&Aacute;R sometimes masks areas of concern.  In areas along the south coast and into Wexford where there has been depopulation of young people, the overall population tends to remain stagnant because many retirees move down.  Those retirees are very welcome but they can sometimes mask depopulation due to the departure of young people.  Without young people our rural areas simply cannot progress.

As the Minister, Deputy Ross, rightly knows, ice and snow bring a Christmas thrill but not to many motorists, cyclists or pedestrians for whom icy conditions are a time of anxiety for many people who go about their business, often in scary driving conditions.  The Minister might pardon the pun but any public representative worth his or her salt would tell him that, apart from the public complaints about potholes and poor road surfaces, at this time of the year as temperatures plummet many become justifiably frustrated.  Constituents call our offices complaining about there been no salting of the roads, not to mention the irate parents who often ring to say their child has just written off his or her first car.<\/p>  <p>  My purpose in raising this matter in the season that is in it is to hope that winter gritting programme would be publicised more widely in terms of how it works and to make road users more aware of how it operates and to offer an exchange in terms of the ways in which the programme could be improved and expanded to be responsive and more impactful in the interests of safer driving with fewer accidents and a more co-ordinated approach and understanding of the way local authorities can respond.<\/p>  <p>The IceCast system, as I described it, is now known as the Vaisala road DSS manager &ndash; it is difficult for people to get their tongue around that.  One can call it what one likes but all we need to know is that there is an effective and efficient system and that the road user who pays his or her motor tax, property tax and income tax achieves equity in reaching his or her destination in the shortest possible time on the most suitable salted route.  The aim of the programme is to keep the major routes as free as possible from hazardous road conditions but with the current process, which involves weather forecasting in terms of the Vaisala system I referred to, the system is only 85% effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100031#DD01300","speaker":"1332"},{"type":"speech","time":1544551500,"counter":448,"content":"<p>Deputy Breathnach has raised most of the issues.  We have all seen practical examples, despite all the technology used now, where the system has failed road users on certain mornings.  The Minister is very familiar with the N11, which we often see being gritted in the evening and late into the night.  However, we have had significant rainfall overnight recently and a refreeze but at that stage it is too late to grit.  The cars are on the road and the damage has been done.  We have seen that happen quite a few times in recent years.  While technology has brought more advances, it is about getting the grit quality right, the density of the grit and so on.  All of that is improving.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of the regional and local roads, different standards apply and there is a different approach to the regional roads.  I recall getting a call from a constituent at 6.30 a.m. one morning to say that the long hill was completely covered in ice.  That was because the road had been gritted but it rained and the surface froze over the gritting.  The long hill was an ice rink that morning and by the time word got to the local authority to get the staff back out on the roads, almost two and a half hours had passed, which caused major problems.<\/p>  <p>  Many national roads, including the M11, have been taken over privately in terms of providing maintenance, which is contracted.  There is a different contractor on the M50 but the two roads inter-link.  Is there co-operation between them to ensure all of them spread grit at the same time and with the same consistency to ensure the road user knows that the road will be cleared from one end to the other?

Within its current and capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of expenditure is a matter for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act.<\/p>  <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority.  The selection and prioritisation of works, including winter maintenance programmes, are also a matter for each local authority.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputies will have heard previously, Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance of national, regional and local roads places significant demands on local authorities.  Each local authority prepares an annual winter maintenance programme which outlines its plans for managing winter operations, including gritting.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, TII operates the IceNet road weather information system, previously known as IceCast, to assist local authorities in the management and delivery of each local authority's winter maintenance activities.  TII operates a network of road weather stations across the national road network, providing up to date information on road weather conditions.  In addition, in conjunction with Met &Eacute;ireann forecasts, the IceNet system provides weather forecasts for the national road network.  This information is also used by local authorities to plan their treatment of regional and local roads.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from TII that the system has been continuously improved and upgraded since the road weather information system was first developed in the 1990s.  In the period since the severe weather episodes in 2010 the number of weather stations has increased from 60 to 100 and about 75 of those stations now have cameras installed with infra-red lighting capability.<\/p>  <p>  Each year, in advance of the winter season, TII convenes an annual winter maintenance conference, attended by all local authorities.  After that, decisions on delivery of winter maintenance activities, including the prioritisation of routes for salting, and where necessary snow ploughing, are operational matters made by local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Local authorities will make the call-out decision having considered the forecast, prevailing road conditions and local information provided by the relevant roads engineers and inspectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100031#DD01500","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1544551500,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his response.

There is no clear policy across local authorities of how to manage and grit local roads.  Some local authorities put boxes of ice on dangerous hills or corners.  Other councils do not bother.  There are many inconsistences across the nation with local and regional roads.  I would like to see if we can move forward to make it standard for a certain level of facilities to be provided on all local roads.

Local authorities are responsible for providing engineering staff, operational staff, drivers, helpers and yard staff, plant including trucks, demountable salt spreaders and snow blades, and managing the drawdown of road salt.  Winter treatment of the motorway network is the responsibility of the relevant public private partnership, PPP, operator or motorway contractor.  In addition to providing the Vaisala road weather information system, RWIS, the role of Transport Infrastructure Ireland is to co-ordinate the annual winter operations programme.  The authority provides support, back-up and funding to the local authorities each year in advance of the winter season.  The authority convenes an annual winter maintenance conference, attended by duty engineers.

I want to read a statement from Olwen Rowe from Wexford, the sister of Kenneth Rowe, who took his own life.  Kenneth was a good friend to two of my sons.  The statement reads:<\/p><blockquote>Families and friends live many nightmares when a loved one dies by suicide.  When there is no warning, the shock and the pain are immense, beyond words.<br \/><br \/>But sometimes, there are warning signs and there's the unthinkable nightmare of seeing your loved one decline, seeing their distress, and repeatedly trying to access professional support for them, but hitting wall after wall.  You watch your loved one fighting for their life without the professional help they desperately need.  You try to believe the experts [who] say that you are over-reacting but you are terrified you&rsquo;ll get the call, or the Garda&iacute; will come to your door, and then that day comes, and your world falls apart.<br \/><br \/>Kenneth was 32.  He was independent, private and self-reliant but when he hit a crisis, he knew he needed help.  With the support of Kenneth&rsquo;s GP and others, Kenneth tried to get help.  My parents spent countless days and nights sitting with Kenneth as he battled his anguish, wrapping him in the light of their love.  They worked tirelessly to get him the care he needed.<br \/><br \/>It was like watching a train hurtle towards an abyss and begging for help from the experts only to be told we were exaggerating, we were overprotective, he&rsquo;d be fine, it was Christmas and there were no appointments, he should get back to work, work stress was normal, he should drink less coffee and get more exercise, he should take the increasing number, and doses of medication he was being prescribed, all without any ongoing support.<br \/><br \/>Kenneth was failed by both public and private mental health services in this country.  It is difficult now to meaningfully engage with those who were asked to provide care for Kenneth, to see why these health systems failed him: whether it was individual failure, shortage in resources, lack of expertise, lack of compassion, lack of understanding.<br \/><br \/>We heard University Hospital Waterford was under pressure for beds, that patients were being admitted and kept in chairs.  Can you imagine how awful it is, hoping a family member would be admitted for psychiatric care and being terrified of whether or not that service would be fit for purpose?  Whether the hell that he was living through, as he tried to get on with his daily life was better than the hell of being admitted to an overstretched mental health facility?<br \/><br \/>Kenneth was sent home from Waterford Hospital 3 times in 5 days.  Imagine our despair that in spite of an urgent referral from Waterford to Summerhill Community Mental Health Services, Kenneth&rsquo;s appointment was for six weeks later.  The wait was impossible.  We were told Kenneth couldn&rsquo;t access mental health services in another public hospital.  As Kenneth&rsquo;s crisis deepened we attempted to access private mental health services at St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Dublin.  This was another disaster, another failure.  There was nowhere else to turn.<br \/><br \/>Kenneth fought so hard to stay alive for everyone and everything he loved.  But he didn&rsquo;t make it.  He ended his life 19 days before his appointment at Summerhill.<br \/><br \/>The Taoiseach gave the opening speech at the Pieta House &ldquo;Darkness Into Light&rdquo; event.  Yet his government has failed to give adequate funding to mental health services.  Suicide rates in Wexford are a lot higher than the national average; yet no emergency mental health services exist in Wexford.  Charities like Pieta House and the Samaritans do good work; but their supports cannot replace the complex psychological and psychiatric care that should be provided by HSE mental health services.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100032#EE00400","speaker":"1355"},{"type":"speech","time":1544552100,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The Deputy will have a further two minutes in his supplementary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100032#EE00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1544552100,"counter":457,"content":"<p>I will just finish.

We have to deal with the issue.  I do not doubt the Deputy's sincerity and integrity about the issues he raised.<\/p><p>I can assure him that tackling suicide is a priority for the Government.  Under the care of my Department, a cross sectoral steering group was established to assist the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in implementing Connecting for Life - Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide.  This is a six year strategy running from 2015 to 2020.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is part of the HSE and was specifically established to co-ordinate suicide prevention efforts around the country and to implement Connecting for Life.  To support NOSP, funding was increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;12 million.  An additional &euro;275 million was provided in 2015 for additional resource officers for suicide prevention and for priority actions under Connecting for Life.<\/p> <p> Wexford&rsquo;s local Connecting for Life plan was launched in January 2016 and is aligned to the national strategy.  As suicide affects each person in the community, this local plan is a collaboration by individuals and statutory and non-statutory bodies in the communities throughout Wexford.  It has built on work already begun in Wexford since the initial countrywide plan was launched in 2004.  The work of NOSP has helped to reduce the number of suicides in Ireland from 495 in 2010 to 392 in 2017.  It must be noted that the 2017 figures are provisional and by their nature are subject to change and so should be interpreted with caution at this time.<\/p> <p> The NOSP efforts in suicide prevention include training programmes such as safeTALK and ASIST.  In addition, the Little Things campaign focuses on measures we can all do to protect our own mental health and to support the people we care about.  Children and adolescents who present with suicidal ideation in Wexford, depending on their presentation, may be referred to a number of services, including a school counsellor; teen counselling services in the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service, FYDS; the HSE child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, in Wexford; the HSE primary care community psychology services and the HSE self-harm intervention programme, SHIP.  In addition, the report of the national task force on youth mental health contains a number of recommendations on youth mental health that have been incorporated into the service plans of lead agencies and priorities for 2018 and 2019.  Additionally, the Pathfinder project, which will be the first of its kind, will bring together officials from a number of relevant Departments to form a unit focused on youth mental health.  This work will include the implementation of the recommendations of the national task force on youth mental health.<\/p> <p> I accept the Deputy's point that nothing will bring back Kenneth Rowe, the lovely young man about whom he spoke, or take away the sadness in his sister's heart.  We must develop mental health services that will help young people, in particular young men like Kenneth.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100032#EE01200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544552700,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I do not wish to personalise this or to blame any one Minister for the problem.

The people of Wexford are of the view that there are not adequate services available to them.  Young people are dying because the help they need is not available to them.  In the last month, a 13 year old boy and a 15 year old girl committed suicide in Wexford.  Wexford has the highest rate of suicide in the country.  There is a serious problem there.  Kenneth's sister believes that the Government has failed to adequately fund mental health services in Wexford.  I am sorry to have to say it, but that is the truth.  This Government and its predecessor failed to hit the mark in terms of mental health service provision.<\/p>  <p>  People in Wexford are constantly ringing and texting me asking why nothing is changing, what the Government is doing to address this issue and if the Government cares.

The Deputy is right in what he said.  According to the three year moving average rate of suicide per 100,000 population by county of residents deceased between 2004 to 2017, the national average was 8.8%.  In Wexford, its is 11.1%.

We become much more exercised about traffic at Christmas time but this Topical Issue is about traffic congestion all year round and specific issues that the Minister might consider addressing.<\/p>  <p>  At Christmas time, people like to be relaxed but at any given time of the day there is intense traffic and pedestrian movement to and from the city or major shopping centres such as Dundrum shopping centre in the Minister's constituency, The Square in my constituency or in Liffey Valley and Blanchardstown centres as people attempt to do their Christmas shopping and enjoy the festive spirit.  There is nothing worse than being stuck in a car or on a bus that is not moving, aggravated by weather conditions.  One of the principles behind what was previously known as Operation Freeflow but is now known as Operation Open City is that all road works and so on are curtailed or undertaken during less busy commuting hours.  At the entrance to my estate on Scholarstown Road, an area which the Minister previously represented, there is a roundabout at which major works are being carried out.  This roundabout is 200 yd. from the M50 and thus there are never ending tailbacks.  This work is due to continue until 17 December which means there is no Operation Open City in this area.  I would like the Minister to whom I can appeal under Operation Open City to take action in this regard, particularly at this time of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to comment on a couple of issues.  The Minister and I have previously engaged in this Chamber on the cost of congestion to the city annually, which is currently &euro;300 million and is expected to increase by 2030 to approximately &euro;2 billion annually.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Dublin Chamber discovered that one of the matters that frequently cheeses off commuters and deters them from using public transport is the reality that bus journey times are uncompetitive with car journey times.<\/p> <p> I travel in a number of ways, be it walking, cycling, driving the car and occasionally on the bus.  The bus lanes are not policed adequately.  Does the Minister, the NTA or the councils have any plans for this?  I realise that it uses up many Garda resources but if they were policed, the benefit would be twofold.  A number of bus lanes do not operate on a 24-hour basis but when they are operational, cars simply fill up the space.  That habit has been allowed to form because there is a lack of observational police control over it.  However, if they were properly policed, many more people would have confidence in using the bus to commute to and from town or other areas.  This is one matter in which the Minister could take a particular interest.  There are others.  We could try to facilitate a number of park-and-ride facilities on the outskirts of the city and in the suburbs by using existing car parks that are not used during office hours.<\/p> <p> These are just a few ideas for the Minister and I welcome his feedback on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100033#FF00700","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544553300,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his constructive suggestions.  Congestion is a feast that keeps on giving.  It must be wonderful to be a transport spokesperson or spokesperson on Dublin in the opposition and wonder what to have a go at on a given day.  One could talk about congestion every day until kingdom come and one would still find problems.  We admit that it is not optimal.  There are problems with congestion and it is easy to tackle it from the Opposition.  The Government is not ashamed of the strong measures it has taken to relieve congestion.  It is a little odd that when we do something right at Christmas, the complaint becomes, \"Why not do it all year round?\" rather than, \"Well done, it is working at Christmas\".  It is a short and sharp attempt to tackle the traffic challenge around Christmas.  Thankfully, it is successful even if there still is congestion.  The Deputy acknowledges it and I am grateful to him for that.<\/p>  <p>  It is a matter of Garda enforcement.  While we welcome what the garda&iacute; are doing, it would be difficult for them to do it all year round.  I guess that is because of resources.  I do not know because Garda enforcement is not in my portfolio.  However, the Garda makes an extra special effort with extra manpower on the city traffic flow and it tackles that with some success, but I assume those resources must be deployed elsewhere or are not available during the rest of the year.  I congratulate the Garda on what it has been doing around Christmas.  I share the Deputy's aspiration that we could have perfection or near perfection all the time, but we will not get that in respect of the traffic flow and congestion in Dublin for some time to come.  That does not mean we are not tackling it; we are doing that constructively.<\/p>  <p>  Operation Open City aims to help people get about their day's business, and enjoy the seasonal festivities, by facilitating the movement of public transport in Dublin and minimising traffic disruption to the general public through high visibility and enforcement activity.  The operation is led each year by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A number of different agencies are involved in supporting the work of the Garda such as the National Transport Authority, NTA, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, the Dublin local authorities, transport providers and the business community.  However, the issue of congestion in our cities, while it may become more acute over the Christmas period, is a challenge all year round.  As can be seen from Operation Open City each Christmas, that challenge requires a multi-agency response.  I assure the Deputy that such an approach is being adopted in Dublin city and the wider greater Dublin area.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA, Dublin City Council and TII, in conjunction with public transport operators, are progressing various measures to ensure efficient functioning of transport within the city centre.  These measures can be found in the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as well as the 2015 Dublin city centre transport study which was prepared by the city council and the NTA.  Not surprisingly, a key thrust of both is to significantly improve public transport infrastructure and services, as well cycling and walking facilities in the city.  A number of recently completed projects have served to improve both capacity and quality of service.  These include the opening of Luas cross city last year, the reopening of the Phoenix Park tunnel for commuter trains to and from Kildare at the end of 2016, the introduction earlier this year of ten minute DART services, investment in cycle routes and public bike sharing schemes and the renewal and expansion of the PSO bus fleets.<\/p>  <p>  This week, new timetables came into operation across the commuter rail network, which provide for extended services throughout the day.  Next year, the PSO bus fleet in the city will increase by approximately 70 and the fleet has expanded by 17% in the past couple of years.  The Luas green line capacity enhancement project will continue in 2019 with the delivery of extended trams expected toward the end of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100034#GG00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1544553300,"counter":473,"content":"<p>The Minister started by saying it must be wonderful to be in opposition and raising traffic congestion, which is the gift that keeps on giving.  It does not give me any pleasure to do it because it is a problem on which he does not appear to be making an impact.  I have not seen a significant Garda presence on the street.  However, let us keep the focus on positive matters.  Did the Minister call the representatives of all the agencies to his Department, because if I was in his position I would do this a month or two months before the Christmas period, and have a discussion with them, push them hard on the measures they could take and ask them if they look at international experience?  It would be a logical first step for a Minister with responsibility for transport to hear from them at first hand and also to offer some suggestions.<\/p>  <p>  Perhaps the Minister would abandon the script for his response to the next issue, which is the bus lanes.  This could benefit people all year round.  If they are policed adequately, particularly the important ones, and if people are penalised when they drive in a bus lane, they will learn a habit that will continue over the rest of the year .  It is not about penalising them for being in a bus lane but because the bus simply cannot proceed when there are cars in the bus lane.  The buses are held up and do not meet their timetables so the public is less inclined to take public transport.  This would be a real public transport initiative.<\/p>  <p>  There is another issue.  On the next occasion the Minister meets the representatives of Luas and Dublin Bus could he ask them why all vehicles must start at a terminus?  I have raised this with Dublin Bus.  In Dundrum and Sandyford in the Minister's constituency, is there some technical or logistical reason that Luas cannot dispatch the occasional empty tram at peak times that passes a few stops and starts at Dundrum and is able to pick up everybody on the platform instead of starting every Luas at the terminus?  It is similar with buses.  Many people in different areas complain that if a bus was allowed to start boarding passengers four or five stops into the route, it could absorb the capacity and there would not be the problem of packed buses passing people queuing at bus stops.<\/p>  <p>  These are two or three simple solutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100034#GG00300","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1544553300,"counter":474,"content":"<p>It is difficult to respond without being too detailed, which is not in my brief.

However, I meet representatives of the NTA, Luas, Dublin Bus and the other bodies the Deputies mentioned regularly and I express the type of concerns he expressed regularly.  They are aware of that.

I am disappointed the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, is not in the Chamber to take the Topical Issue matter.  Perhaps there is a reason for that.  I will address it with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who is designated in the Minister's place.<\/p>  <p>  There is a very frustrating situation currently where community groups have been awarded grants for community CCTV but they are not in a position to draw down the grants.  Mullaghmore, Woodenbridge and Mountmellick community alerts in Laois are all shackled at the moment.  Those groups have raised thousands of euro towards a CCTV scheme through voluntary efforts but they are in a situation where they cannot put their plans into action because of a dispute over who is the data controller.  I have raised the issue previously in the Chamber, and I raised it at the Laois local joint policing committee, JPC, of which I am a member.  The policing committee asked me to raise the issue with the Minister, and I have spoken to him about it.  I am trying to get greater clarity on it but we do not seem to be getting any closer to a solution.  We need to push on to solve it and crack this nut.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on September 25 and he told me he was anxious to sit down with the remaining handful of local authorities with a view to dealing with the issue.  At that stage 26 out of 31 local authorities had agreed to be data controllers.  Some people in local government believe the role should be taken on by the Garda, and I will return to this point shortly, but information that has since come to light shows that the responsibility is with the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue again in the Chamber with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 29 November during questions to the Minister.  The Minister replied with greater clarity and he set it out very clearly that 28 out of 31 local authorities across the State had taken on the job of data controller for local CCTV schemes.  Three local authorities, however, are refusing, including Laois County Council.  The Minister also stated that \"the Data Protection Commissioner does not have any concerns about the legislative basis for CCTV.\"  The Data Protection Commissioner is happy with it.  The Minister also stated the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV, that he expected findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and, in particular, to local authorities and that his Department was engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association.  In reply to another question the Minister clearly stated that \"the legal requirement for local authorities to act as data controller for the purpose of community CCTV schemes has been in place since 2006.\"  That is in black and white.  It is useful that the Minister nailed that information in the D&aacute;il Chamber when I asked that question but we are no further on.  There are meetings in Laois on issue - I am sure it affects other counties - to try to get a solution.<\/p>  <p>  What has happened since the commitment was given in September that the Minister would sit down with the handful of remaining local authorities?  Has he sat down with the remaining local authorities?  Have his officials sat down with the local authority chief executive officers to see why they are holding this up?<\/p>  <p>  On 29 November it was stated that the Department officials were again meeting with the CEOs of the local authorities.  Has there been progress as a result of that?  The Data Protection Commissioner does not have any concerns about the legislation and that the data controller would be the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The community alert groups, such as those in Mullaghmore, Woodenbridge and Mountmellick, are all shackled despite having raised thousands of euro.  They cannot move ahead to implement the scheme.  It is very disappointing because Laois has a motorway running through it and people there are particularly vulnerable.  There is concern about the issue in all those neighbourhoods.<\/p>  <p>  People are trying to work with the Garda and there is good co-operation with garda&iacute;.

I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this very important issue and I recognise his serious interest in the matter.  The Minister and I have heard from many groups of their desire for CCTV in their local areas and we know the sense of security that it can bring to many communities.  Responding to this demand, the Government has made significant funding available to assist groups wishing to establish community CCTV in their areas.  The grant aid scheme administered by the Department of Justice and Equality is intended to run for three years, with &euro;1 million available each year.<\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that there are a number of legal requirements around establishment of CCTV.  CCTV systems installed for the purposes of crime prevention and as aids to policing in areas to which the general public routinely have access, such as town centres, fall into two distinct but complementary categories, namely, Garda CCTV systems and community-based CCTV systems.  Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.  Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006.  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must: be approved by the local joint policing committee; have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner; and have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.  I emphasise that this is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from the Department to assist in their establishment.<\/p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, the vast majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes.  This has been the case either in the course of the current grant aid scheme administered by the Department of Justice and Equality, during the previous grant aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, has informed me that, based on his Department&rsquo;s engagement with the Local Government Management Agency, the number of local authorities that have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide, as Deputy Stanley already said.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has, on 29 November of this year, issued a guidance on data protection and community CCTV.  The guidance, which is available on the Data Protection Commission website, confirms that there is a legal basis for community based CCTV and that the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, does not introduce new barriers in that regard.  In particular, the Data Protection Commissioner's guidance states:<\/p><blockquote>Data protection legislation does not stand in the way of the roll-out of Community based CCTV schemes that have been authorised by the Garda Commissioner.  Once the local authority in the administrative area concerned is willing to take on and deliver on its responsibilities as a data controller for the schemes concerned, there is no legal impediment under data protection legislation to the scheme commencing.<\/blockquote><p>The guidance covers a number of other issues also - for example, confirming that local authorities are not required, as a result of their role as data controller, to monitor CCTV live feeds on a continuous basis.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is confident that this and other clarifications in the note will be of significant assistance to local authorities in how they carry out their role in relation to community CCTV.<\/p><p>The Data Protection Commissioner is also currently conducting an audit of issues, including the practice, operation and governance of CCTV.  Again, it is to be expected that the more detailed findings of that process to be of assistance to all concerned and, in particular, to local authorities.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Department of Justice and Equality is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association to clarify any queries arising.<\/p><p>A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems and, as I said, the Department of Justice and Equality is administering a grant aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas.  Eligible groups can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV scheme, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  I am informed that to date there have been 27 applications to the scheme, with 20 applications approved for grants totalling more than &euro;500,000.  A further four applications to the scheme are currently being assessed and considered.  The remaining three applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to supply the information necessary to qualify for grant aid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100035#HH00600","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1544554500,"counter":481,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.  His reply brings further clarity to the situation.

That is clear and has been established.  He also said that he has received feedback from the Data Protection Commissioner, who confirmed that there is no issue with local authorities doing this in respect of the new GDPR regulations.  We are removing the roadblocks.  I want to be fair to the CEOs of the local authorities.  Perhaps it is an issue of resources, finance or IT staff, particularly for the smaller local authorities.

The Minister has indicated that he considers it important that communities are able to make decisions to enhance their own sense of security.  Community CCTV schemes are one way in which communities choose to do this.  With Garda approval and local authority co-operation, communities can play a real role in making themselves feel safer and be safer.  We are confident that the guidance issued recently by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding data protection and CCTV will be very helpful to all concerned, as the Deputy has outlined, and particularly to local authorities as they carry out their role.  The Minister has asked me to put on record his thanks to local authorities that have supported such schemes and to assure them that his officials are doing all they can to further streamline and simplify the process.  Officials in the Department of Justice and Equality are available to provide initial guidance on the application process for grant aid and I encourage the Deputy and other colleagues to join the Minister and me in encouraging interested groups to take advantage of the scheme.  I will bring back the request that the Deputy has made to the Department and the Minister.  Only three local authorities have not signed up to this.  They probably have their own reasons.

The amendments we hoped to move, which were ruled out of order, provided that there would be a certain conditionality on that.  We agree with section 1 but we want conditions put on it.  While for the purposes of pressing those conditions, they have been ruled out of order, it is entirely in order to say that the decision of the D&aacute;il to expand the loan capacity of the Irish Film Board should be conditional.  I seriously appeal to the Minister and the Department to examine the conditions relating to this significant public funding for the film industry, particularly in the areas of the extent to which the loans and grants that are given out by the Irish Film Board are helping to develop the industry and to create quality employment and training in it.  That should be the point of public funding.  In 2016, this stream of funding resulted in &euro;12 million being distributed in loans.<\/p><p>It varies from &euro;12 million to &euro;16 million depending on the year.  That is a lot of money.  In addition, there is the section 481 tax relief that comes via Revenue.  I was just at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight at which this matter was also discussed.  Last year, that tax relief amounted to &euro;100 million.  There is &euro;100 million in tax relief and &euro;12 million to &euro;16 million coming through the Irish Film Board.  Most of this money goes to approximately 12 film production companies, with the bulk of it going to about seven of those.  It is very good that the State is funding the Irish film industry.  I want to see more funding for that industry, whether it is via Revenue or through direct grant aid.  However, we need to ask what we are getting out of it.  At the meeting of Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the representatives from the Parliamentary Budget Office, who are independent people, stated there is a real problem with us evaluating public expenditures.  We allocate money every year but we are not so good at scrutinising what we get in return.<\/p> <p> In the film industry, what is the result of &euro;300 million of public funding via the Irish Film Board and probably another &euro;1 billion through section 481 tax relief?  What tangible results do we get for that level of public investment?  Even though most of the money has gone to approximately 12 companies, those companies employ almost nobody.  There may be a few administrative positions in some of the bigger ones, but there are no jobs.  What film infrastructure does the State own?  The answer is almost none.  Even though we finance these companies, they have not created any long-term employment and the State owns virtually no infrastructure.  That is a problem.  I want to see the investment, but where is the net result?<\/p> <p> I just came from a meeting of actors and performers which, unfortunately, coincided with this debate and at which the topic is that they are the working poor, living a completely precarious existence.  That echoes some of the stuff I heard from the film industry.  This is another area of the arts where the performers are saying they are living in dirt poverty.  A dancer who is very prominent on the international stage is living on &euro;12,000 a year.  She asked what kind of future she has.  At the age of 20, 21 or 22, she might have been happy to sustain that for a while, living with six people in a small apartment, but where is her future?  The answer is that she has no career progression, which is a problem.  For all this public money, there has to be a career progression and some sort of future for people who work in the industry.<\/p> <p> Although the amendments have been ruled out of order, I appeal to the Minister.  I welcome the great engagement in recent weeks by Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  I have brought workers in with me to meet officials.  That is a great improvement and positive signals are coming from the Government.  This is not a criticism of the Government, but we need to address the issue of employment in the industry.<\/p> <p> It would be wrong for the film industry to run purely on a for-profit or commercial viability basis because we need to subsidise the arts.  However, let us consider the figures for the loans being given out.  In 2007 &euro;16 million in loans was given out.  The amount recouped from these loans was &euro;1.1 million.  The following year &euro;17 million was given out and &euro;1.3 million was recouped.  In the year after that &euro;15 million was given out and was &euro;738,000 was recouped.  It is pretty much the same picture each year, with less than 10% of the money recouped.  A lot of money is being loaned out with very little coming back.  One could say that this is acceptable because we need to subsidise the film industry.  However, how much are we getting back in tax revenue from the sector?  Is that maximised?  Much of the employment is precarious, with people being forced to work as contractors, freelancers and so on.  They are not getting direct employment and there is resistance from the production companies to employ people directly as PAYE workers.  Not only do they face an existence where they do not know from job to job if they have a future in the industry and are very vulnerable, but if they look for their rights, ask for PAYE employment, try to get overtime rates or anything like that, they will be told they will not be coming back for the next production because they have asked about these things.  That is bad for them but it is also bad for Revenue because, generally speaking, it would get a considerable amount of money from PAYE employment.  The Revenue Commissioners would get a higher yield of tax through PAYE than they tend to get when the whole thing is freelance and self-employed.<\/p> <p> We need to link this public funding more closely with creating quality employment and training.  The workers need career progression and a properly structured system of training.  That training needs to be linked to trainees on productions and not just training in the abstract.  The Irish Film Board runs some courses, but what is the relationship between that and trainees working on productions?  People are categorised as trainees, but it is never clear when they cease to be a trainee and become a qualified professional.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100036#JJ01900","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544555100,"counter":500,"content":"<p>We can ask the Minister if she can deal with those questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100037#KK00200","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544555100,"counter":501,"content":"<p>I have not finished.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100037#KK00300","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1544555100,"counter":502,"content":"<p>All right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100037#KK00400","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1544555100,"counter":503,"content":"<p>We need to have those things.

These are things we need.<\/p>  <p>  At one of the meetings I attended with officials from Revenue and the Department of Finance, the workers from the film industry actually showed that in the past there was a register of trainees.  There is no longer such a register.  We actually had some of these things in the past but we do not have them now.  Why is that the case?  If we did have them, we could know who the trainees are and could track if they are progressing from production to production so that we are developing the skills base of the industry.  This has relevance when we talk about attracting inward investment.<\/p>  <p>  Internationally, film production is ramping up very significantly with organisations such as HBO, Netflix, Amazon and others, but how much of this stuff are we getting?  I think we are not getting enough and part of the reason we are not getting enough is that there is not enough stability in the skills pool.  When they come here it needs to be clear to that them we have the infrastructure and people skilled in all these areas.  However, it is too precarious for the workers.  It is also too fragmented in terms of what potential investors might be looking for.  We need those registers of employees and we need direct PAYE employment.<\/p>  <p>  This issue was discussed with the officials from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I know they are looking at it.  The Irish Film Board should be expanded.  It needs stakeholders from across the industry and not just the producers.  Of course, we need producers on the Irish Film Board, but we also need workers on the board and people who will evaluate how the money is being allocated, and the extent to which the State is getting a good return based on criteria such as employment, building up infrastructure and cultural impact.<\/p><p>All of these factors need to be assessed independently and not just by producers.  We need to look at issues like potential conflicts of interest whereby producers on the film board are lending money to their own production companies.  I am not saying that those producers should not be on the board but we must be very careful about this kind of thing.  As I understand it, there was a very substantial revamp of the film board in Britain.  The British got rid of their film board and created a film commission which has a much wider industry stakeholder involvement, including workers as well as producers, performers and others.<\/p> <p> I hope to hear more from the Minister on this and I also believe that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have a role to play in this area.  Revenue and the relevant Departments must work together to progress these matters, which would be to the benefit of the entire industry.  It would also be very much to the benefit of those who work in the industry to have direct employment and the full application of all of their employment rights, which many would say is not happening currently.  It would also help to draw in more investment from some of the big international producers of film and television in the audiovisual sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100037#KK00500","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544555700,"counter":505,"content":"<p>I also submitted an amendment to section 1 which was ruled out of order.  My amendment sought to address some of the concerns raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The amendment, which should still be accommodated by the Minister, calls on her to produce regulations which would rule out certain work practices and govern terms and conditions of employment in the film industry.<\/p>  <p>  The State has invested an enormous amount of money in this sector.  Tax relief is tax forgone which means that the Irish people have not enjoyed that money because it has been invested in the film industry rather than being collected in taxes.  What do we have to show for that?  What are the consequences and benefits of that?  Certainly from an artistic point of view and in terms of our international standing and the films that have been made here, the results are obvious.  While terms and conditions of employment and the skill set of those working in the Irish film industry have also improved, we still do not have the register to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred earlier.  As with many other industries, many of those working in the sector have gone overseas.  The film sector, like many others, is experiencing a brain drain.<\/p>  <p>  As I have said, we are investing in the sector through both grant aid and tax forgone.  In that context, we need to be sure that the Irish taxpayer and this Parliament are getting a bang for our buck and I do not just mean getting international exposure because we have contributed to the production of a very good film and to the enjoyment of millions who watch it.  We also need to see the industry achieve sustainability.  When I was first elected, I was lobbied very heavily in 2004 on section 481.  The lobbying campaign was absolutely brilliant in its execution.  Those working in the industry as well as their family members were involved in writing individual letters.  It was not like the campaigns we see nowadays, with the same email sent multiple times.  The letters were from individuals and their families who appealed to Deputies to retain the aforementioned section 481 tax relief in order to keep themselves, their brothers, uncles and so on in employment.  I had absolutely no problem with that at the time and I still have no problem with it.  However, 14 years later it is hard to stand over the benefits since then.  There is no State-owned infrastructure as a result of this investment.  We do not have terms and conditions of employment here that would be considered second to none in the film industry.  Indeed, we lag very far behind in that regard.  Quality employment is not being created and quality training is not being provided.  Certainly, new workplaces and new film studios are being developed but they are not State owned.<\/p>  <p>  I raised the issue of continuity of employment when we last discussed the film industry.  It is not too difficult to know what film is coming next.  While there will always be some sort of gap in terms of when people with different levels of expertise are required on a film set or in film production, it should be relatively easy to work out how many people are working at a given point in time.  What we have seen is people being counted twice or three times over the course of a year so that the figures for employment in the industry are inflated.  Figures are often announced by F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann or the Department which are exaggerated.  That is not the fault of F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann or the Department which are getting these figures from the industry.  The figures should come with a caveat because some people will work for two months on one film set, for three months on another and for six on a third set.<\/p>  <p>  These are matter which should have been dealt with in this Bill.  My amendment has been ruled out of order because it has been deemed to be unrelated to the aims of this Bill.  However, it is related because if we are jumping from an allowable spend of &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million, we should be able to attach caveats or rules to that.  That is what we tried to do with our amendments.  We also raised these matters during the Second Stage debate.  We know what F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann or Screen Ireland spends.  That is clear and is increasing, which I welcome.  However, we have not seen problems in the industry being addressed and if they were addressed, we might not even need amendments to legislation.  In my amendment, I was trying to give the Minister some leeway in allowing her to introduce regulations.  As with other similar legislation, the Minister would be making regulations.  That said, I would prefer that any regulations would be presented to the relevant Oireachtas committee before being signed off.  In this instance, given the short period of time involved and the lack of pre-legislative scrutiny, we did not have a detailed discussion on this.  I also did not want to delay the Bill unnecessarily.<\/p>  <p>  The funding of films here is done by way of the creation of special purpose vehicles which, of itself, can create problems.  I have already mentioned the fact that many jobs in the industry are precarious.  People are given work for a week here and a week there.  If they raise any concerns or complaints, they are guaranteed that not only will they be put off the set on which they are currently working, but that they will not get work on another set and in some cases, they will not work on a film set in Ireland ever again.  People might be trying to look out for colleagues on a film set.  They might raise matters related to bullying or ask about compensation for working over and above hours for which they are contracted to work or for which no advance notice was given.  A lot of people to whom I have spoken have said that at some points in their careers, they were almost expected to work for nothing.  We are all aware of the scandals related to unpaid internships in the past.  Employment in the industry is precarious with many people on zero hour contracts.<\/p><p>That ties in with the need for greater liaison among the Minister, the Department, F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure people who work in an industry from which we all benefit have some type of a financial net between periods of employment in the film industry.<\/p> <p> There are a number of other issues which need to be considered.  Will the Minister give an undertaking to return to the issue of films?  We will not oppose the legislation at this point but there are concerns, and we need some indication at some stage that she will seriously address the concerns that have been raised with me and other Deputies, whether through regulation or other legislation, to ensure this industry is properly regulated?  We have similarly asked in the Chamber for other industries to be properly regulated in order that there is not abuse and that there is some mechanism of redress, which does not now exist.<\/p> <p> The Minister raised the point that a worker can be blacklisted in the film industry.  When workers come forward to Deputies as whistleblowers, they do not want their names mentioned in the House for fear of losing the job in which they have spent many years working and gaining expertise.  In some cases, these people are the best in the industry, yet they fear for their job even though there might not be anyone who can match them in this jurisdiction or on many others.  They fear for their job because it is precarious employment.<\/p> <p> We have a reputation for being favourable to art, artists and those working in the arts.  That reputation is generally justified but not in regard to the concerns I have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100038#LL00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544556300,"counter":507,"content":"<p>I will not take long because I covered many of the points I wished to make when I spoke on the Bill last Thursday.  It is regrettable that amendments which could have had a positive impact on the industry have been ruled out of order.  Whatever about the increase in the loan capacity from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million, the extension of section 481 and the increase to &euro;100 million in the maximum tax relief for the film industry, the promotion of equality and fair employment within the industry was attached to the introduction of those measures.  Equality and fair employment is provided for by the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 or the Organisation of Working Time Act, but the Acts are not having the desired effect.  <\/p>  <p>  As I explained last Thursday, I have spoken with workers in the industry who have worked in it for 20 years.  These workers were on registered lists of employees or trainees when they entered the industry.  They have seen the way the industry has gone over the past 14 or 15 years.  They are not mad, agitators or difficult people.  Rather, they are trying to ensure the job in which they work gives them the money to at least pay mortgages, bills, for their children's upbringing, food to put on the table and for all the things that are expected.  Section 481 is supposed to ensure equality and fair employment within the industry, but we are not seeing it.  Surely the best way to approach this is to provide for regulations attached to the section to examine registers of employees, trainees and apprenticeships in order that they can be checked against the figures that the industry claims.  <\/p>  <p>  I support the amendments, in particular, Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment, which provides for the reconfiguring and expansion of the board of Screen Ireland to include workers representing various parts of the industry, such as actors and people work with props or in production.  It is important the Minister produces the report outlined in the amendment.<\/p>  <p>  Section 481 requires employers to ensure equality and fair employment in order to be eligible to receive the &euro;100 million but if there are no checks on how it is working, it is a failure of the Oireachtas and the Government.  If it is the case that there is equality and fair employment, where are the people and where are they on the list?  Do they work full time, pay PAYE and provide money to the Exchequer through their taxes?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100039#MM00200","speaker":"1306"},{"type":"speech","time":1544556300,"counter":508,"content":"<p>I do not wish to obstruct in any way the passage of the Bill, but in the context of shortly proceeding to Report Stage, I demand the Minister consider the three amendments before her.  Two of the amendments are related to reports, while mine proposes that a committee be established under the aegis of the board.  The creation of a committee is in order because the Title of the legislation is the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill.  It is perfectly in order, therefore, to amend the Irish Film Board for a purpose with which the Minister probably agrees, namely, to ensure that the way in which the Irish Film Board carries out its work includes a committee to provide insight into and oversight of the terms and conditions under which people work in the industry.  It is also important to consider the training provided in respect of the industry, as we discussed in a previous session.  Some of it is provided at third level or used to be provided at FETAC level, and much of it is done in public educational facilities to degree or master's standard.  It attracts a significant number of students every year.  By discussing the amendment I tabled on behalf of the Labour Party, I intend to give the Minister breathing space for an amendment, which is perfectly in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100039#MM00300","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1544556300,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to intervene but we may not discuss an amendment that is not in order.

When I was T&aacute;naiste and Fine Gael was in government, it agreed at my request to introduce and advance the issue of workers' rights through registered employment agreements and the establishment of a pay commission to ensure fair pay, protection of the minimum wage and a movement to a living wage.  Those are all facts and Fine Gael signed up to them.  On its own, however, Fine Gael seems to have backtracked and reneged on the notion of protecting workers' rights.  That is reflected in our Constitution and in our laws through various structures established by the State.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>This is another State board and as with other State boards, it has the inherent capacity, with the agreement of the Minister and the Department, to provide mechanisms, committees and subcommittees of a board that are a standard feature of State boards and to allow for the proper regulation of employment conditions and the proper examination of the appropriateness of training and education for the industry.<\/p> <p> This is important for two reasons.  We want young, creative people to be trained and educated to work in this industry.  Many of them are  not just creative but they have a great love for and interest in the industry.  They may be writers of screenplays, actors or technical people working in the support of production.  What I have put forward is perfectly legitimate.  We heard much talk the last day, and we have heard comments at committees, that there is much difficulty and strife in the industry.  The industry has, as a consequence, ended up with a difficult reputation in some countries.<\/p> <p> It is the responsibility of the Minister to assist the industry.  In a way, the Minister is doing this by increasing the loan capacity of the board, which I support and do not wish to obstruct.  I am offering, as a person with much of experience of Government and      of different Departments, a mechanism to her which will allow her and her officials to offer leadership in addressing what is clearly a problem in the regulation of the sector, in particular in regard to the terms and conditions of employment that apply in it.  It is as simple as that.  The Minister would be doing a very significant thing for the progress and viability of the industry.  It is a global industry and we are competing against many other countries for this highly regarded and valuable enterprise.  We are prepared to support it with significant State funding, both directly, although that is not under discussion in the context of this Bill, and by the provision of loans to allow films to be made.  I do not understand why the Minister would resort to creating a financial barrier in this regard.<\/p> <p> The other issue in this industry, which has been covered worldwide and which was referred to in the Labour Party amendment, relates to providing a mechanism to address practices relating to gender pay equality in the industry.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and Fine Gael supported as recently as last week.  The Minister should not tell me she is not aware of serious difficulties in gender pay equality for women in the industry in Ireland and globally because almost everyone who is prominent in the industry has spoken about it in recent times.<\/p> <p> This House has been debating, as has the Seanad, the fact that in this 100th anniversary of votes for women, support for gender pay equality.  That is the wish of the people as well.  On the 100th anniversary of votes for women, the Minister, as a woman in this Department, should provide the structures whereby gender pay parity in this industry could be both examined and progressed.  It is very simple.<\/p> <p> I have not asked the Minister for a detailed report, as the other amendments have, because if she established a committee within the remit of the board, she could address a series of questions which would enable the Department to look at the proper development of the industry alongside the existing supports provided.  This would ensure that women get proper opportunities and that they get pay parity and, ultimately, respect in the industry.  When talking about women's issues, these are the very views the Minister has expressed and supported.<\/p> <p> There are other structures in Ireland, which the Minister and the board can consult, such as Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  In the private sector of education and training, as I am sure the Minister and her officials are fully aware, a lot of fees are being paid and it is reasonable that students would know that the courses they and their parents are paying for are quality courses that will enable them to get employment in Ireland and abroad, if that is what they wish.<\/p> <p> We are looking at a sustainable film industry.  I refer to when Yeats and Lady Gregory established the Abbey Theatre.  Some of the earliest archival material that is available relates to early film.  When Joyce was writing in Dublin, as the Minister is aware, he also had an interest in a cinema on Talbot Street, the Volta, if memory serves me correctly.  When one looks at the greats of Irish literature and theatre, all of them professed a very strong interest in what was the whole area of cinema.<\/p> <p> \"The Quiet Man\" is still shown on a rainy day in Connemara and it is still very recognisable to anyone interested in the history of film in Ireland.  Moving on to the more recent films, we can see some of the extraordinarily talented people that this country has produced.  Let us support and endorse that creativity by examining and ensuring that, as far as possible, a fair regime is established which allows for proper training and qualification, for appropriate experience and which looks at the regulation of employment contracts, salaries, pay and conditions.<\/p> <p> Everybody is aware that the film industry is based on films, so in essence it is project-based for the period of time that it takes each film to be made.  I am really disappointed in this regard.  On the two reports, the late Brian Lenihan, as Minister for Finance, agreed to my request that reports be allowed on the Finance Acts, a much more difficult area than this area of film where we are all largely in agreement.  However, somebody in the Bills Office has kiboshed this.  We know that the Bills Office and the Department contact each other.<\/p> <p> Has the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, a point to make?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100039#MM00500","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544556900,"counter":512,"content":"<p>The Deputy has the floor.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100040#NN00200","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1544556900,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I did not have time to mention Deputy Joan Collins last week, but I thank her for her contribution.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments were ruled out of order on the basis that they dealt with subject matter unconnected to the Bill.  I wish to make clear that the committee itself decided not to go ahead with pre-legislative scrutiny.  It informed the Department of the decision on 18 October.  That is the reason we are here in the D&aacute;il today.  There was no conspiracy in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, this should be a straightforward Bill.  It is a simple Bill to increase, subject to the normal Estimates and budgetary process, the limit for the cumulative capital expenditure of Screen Ireland, F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million.  There is an increase of 14% in 2019 to F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, increasing its allocation to &euro;20.4 million and there was an increase of &euro;2 million in funding to Screen Ireland this year as well.<\/p>  <p>  I will respond to some of the points that have arisen.  In general, there is a ten-year action plan for the audiovisual sector and, under the plan, a steering group will oversee the &euro;200 million investment of taxpayers' money, which is targeted at this sector in the national development plan.  It will also examine funding models, regulatory reform and other supports in addition to general oversight.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies Boyd Barrett, Burton, &Oacute; Snodaigh and Joan Collins mentioned training.  Earlier this year Screen Ireland set up a sub-committee of its board to oversee training.  It also employed a new director of its training division, Screen Skills Ireland.  In the Government's audiovisual action plan, which was published last June, there were a significant number of recommendations and actions to be undertaken in the training area, including the matching of skills with production growth and partnering with third level institutions in skills development.  Reference was made to the unrest in the film industry.  I am acutely aware of that and I would welcome any suggestions from Deputies on a way to remedy it.  There are issues of inter-union rivalry currently, which are stymying any progress and it is very important that we get to the bottom of them.  It is unseemly to have worker representatives at loggerheads with each other on these matters.  Some Deputies are aware that officials from my Department are available to meet with all industry stakeholders and they do so.  Last year, the international consultants, Olsberg SPI, with Nordicity, carried out 90 separate consultations, evaluated 180 data sources and collected data through surveys for their report.<\/p>  <p>  Several contributions related to section 481.  This section excludes broadcasters from applying for the tax relief in their own right and a broadcaster has to partner with an Irish company to qualify for the relief.  A company must also have a record of being in the jurisdiction for 21 months to be paid relief.  That is not an unreasonable provision because it acts to protect the taxpayer.  To obtain tax relief under section 481, each producer company is required to provide proposals to my Department on its planned training to fulfil its requirement under section 481.  The producer company must provide those in its application for the tax relief in advance of the project.  The Department can accept the proposals or request changes.  To monitor the provision of training, each producer company is required to provide a return to the Department on training within four months of the completion of the project.  The return must include the trainee name, the training role, the mentor role, the period of training and the amount of compensation paid to the trainee.  The information provided to my Department is for the purposes of monitoring compliance with the conditions of the award of tax relief under section 481 of the Act.  It contains significant personal information as well, which is subject to data protection requirements, and it cannot be universally disseminated.<\/p>  <p> With regard to legal protections for workers in the film industry, it is important to note that employees in every industry and sector are entitled to all existing legal protections.  As Members will be aware, legislation is being introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 should improve the insecurity and unpredictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours.  Employment law in general should also have a role to play in terms of existing legal protections.  There are also institutions for reporting abuse of employment legislation.  I am satisfied that the industry works in general to a high standard.  My Department is working with all partners to ensure that all sectors of the industry comply with their obligations.<\/p>  <p>  I mentioned the audiovisual action plan that I launched last June.  There is a steering group to implement the plan.  This is a whole-of-Government approach to the audiovisual industry.  Deputy Burton mentioned female representation in the film industry.  Screen Ireland has committed to address gender inequality in Irish film-making.  Screen Ireland is doing all it can to work towards achieving the target of 50:50 gender parity by 2020 in creative talent working in screen content.  There has been a significant increase of 62% in applications received from female talent and an 82% increase in funding awards for female talent in 2018 in comparison to the 2017 figures.<\/p>  <p>  Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Boyd Barrett, Burton and Joan Collins referred to people working in the film industry in general.  My Department has published additional information on its website, which is now available on the audiovisual sector, in the form of a technical annexe to the audiovisual report.  As I mentioned earlier, there were 90 separate consultations.  We must ensure that all the information is taken into account.<\/p>  <p>  The promotion of the Irish film industry in general is the responsibility of Screen Ireland, which was formerly the Irish Film Board.  It is fair to say that it has undergone major change and development both domestically and internationally in recent years.  It has a vision for a vibrant, creative, and sustainable Irish film, television and animation industry with diverse voices, talent and opportunities.  It promotes Irish film and animation in a number of A-list international festivals and markets, as well as promoting Ireland as the location for internationally mobile film production.  The overall audiovisual action plan was launched last June and the key points of the plan include the extension of section 481 tax relief, a regional uplift of 5%, an increase in business skills development, matching the skills with production growth and partnering with third level institutions and skills development.  It is important to note as well that the plan was underpinned by an economic assessment of the audiovisual industry by Nordicity with Olsberg SPI consultants.<\/p><p>They said Ireland's film, television and animation sector could, in a period of five years, double employment to over 24,000 full-time jobs with a gross value of nearly &euro;1.4 billion, and I hope that will happen.<\/p> <p> The loan facility was mentioned by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Burton.  The assistance given by the Government through its various agencies is usually by way of non-repayable grants.  Screen Ireland is unusual in that it awards grants by way of loans which are repaid if and when the project is successful enough to make a profit.  The repayment of any loan allows Screen Ireland to increase the level of loans given to projects.  This system of support operated by Screen Ireland allows Irish indigenous film and television projects to be made which would not otherwise be made.  This means profit is not the only consideration in the support of the audiovisual sector.  As is the case with some statutory bodies that receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay when the Irish Film Board Act was enacted in 1980.  That is why we have to change the limit from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million, as Deputies know.<\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett is right that we need good data to evaluate our investment in the audiovisual sector on an ongoing basis.  As I mentioned, we are going to look at this in the context of the ten-year audiovisual action plan.<\/p> <p> I discussed the question of broadcasters.  There is a balance to be struck.  They are not all international, although I know some international broadcasters have lobbied to have the broadcaster exclusion dropped.  We will examine this to see if there is a disincentive in this regard.<\/p> <p> Deputy Joan Collins referred to Screen Ireland and section 481.  In fact, Screen Ireland has no involvement with section 481.<\/p> <p> Deputies Burton and Joan Collins raised the issue of board appointments.  Nomination to the board is subject to the guidelines for the appointment of members to State boards.  If anyone wants to apply, it is done through the PAS system.  The board of Screen Ireland is not a representative board but it is skills-based under the Act.  There are seven members under the Act and I accept this should be looked at as it is probably a very low number for a board.  Screen Ireland has a robust policy for dealing with conflicts, which is important.  I hope I have covered most of the issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100041#OO00200","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544558100,"counter":521,"content":"<p>I want to-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100042#PP00200","speaker":"1238"},{"type":"speech","time":1544558100,"counter":522,"content":"<p>No, Deputy.

I talked to the person in the Bills Office this morning and she was very reasonable and gave me an explanation.  However, I am just making the point that this is a very important issue.  Some of us believe the continued operation of the film board, which is imperative for the Irish film industry, should also be accompanied by changes to the benefit of the film industry and those who work in it, and in order to ensure the best return for the State for the considerable amount of public funding that goes into it.  That is the context in which we are trying to put in amendments.  They have been ruled out of order on technical grounds, not on political grounds, but I still think it is entirely justifiable for us to use the opportunity to make those points.<\/p>  <p>  To be fair, we often have \"bash each other\" sessions in here but I am not here to bash the Government.  The Government, the Department and the officials have engaged not just with myself but with other stakeholders.  Nonetheless, I would like there to be clarity about where that process of engagement is heading in regard to the film industry, the film board and so on.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to the Minister, and to put it succinctly, those who get the public money should be responsible for delivering the quality employment.  Currently they are not because of the SPV structure.  There are cases in the courts and at the Workplace Relations Commission in regard to trying to look through the SPV structure to the parent recipient, or whatever we want to call it, behind that structure but it is difficult to establish who are the employers and where are the employees.  If the condition of section 481 is quality employment, then a fairly elementary point is to ask who are the employers and who are the employees.  It is not quite clear who is responsible for employees and who are the employees.<\/p>  <p>  One interesting and curious comment came from one of the workers who was, let us say, harshly treated in the recent \"Prime Time\" programme on RT&Eacute;, when he said he did not mind being harshly treated by RT&Eacute; because at least it proves he exists.  He was making a point on these issues.  For example, how do we establish who are the people who work in the industry?  How do they prove they exist?  What rights do they accumulate from one film to the next?  How can it be that somebody works for 12, 15 or 20 years in the industry yet they have no employer and have not accumulated any rights whatsoever?  It is the hope that the Minister will look at these issues.<\/p>  <p>  It is very positive to hear the Minister say she accepts we should look at the size of the film board.  Part of improving that situation would be to have worker representatives, that is, PAYE workers, represented on the board so the workers as well as the producers and the others on the board would have a real input into it, which would make the board more representative of the stakeholders in the industry.  It is not a question of making it bigger but of making it more representative by being certain we have workers on it.  While I do not expect the Minister to say right now that she is definitely going to do that, I would like to hear her say it is a reasonable thing to consider.  We have it in other State bodies and we should have it here.<\/p><p>It would help to resolve some of the problems to which we are referring.<\/p> <p> We should also press ahead with the stakeholder forum.  While one wants to bring everyone on board, at a certain point the Government should establish the forum and put it to people that if they want to have their say on the industry, they should attend.  If they do not want to have their say, they need not attend.  The contributions made at that forum will inform our policy, which is important.<\/p> <p>  The following is a very reasonable thing to ask the Government to consider.  If people are in receipt of public funds and they are found to be in breach of the working time directive, employee rights and so on, we have to consider applying penalties, withdrawing the public funding or holding them to account in some other way .  While there have been some changes in the section 481 relief, we must zone in on it and make it clear that it is not going to be acceptable to behave in this way.  We should expect employees to be categorised correctly.  In most areas where there are allegations of bogus self-employment, the control test is simple to apply.  If someone is told what hours to work, when to have lunch and is subject to someone telling him or her what to do, he or she is an employee.  He or she is not a contractor or self-employed entrepreneur but is, rather, a worker and should be categorised as a PAYE employee.  If a person is miscategorised, he or she will not be given his or her rights.  In the bulk of the situations we are talking about this evening, the majority of workers should be PAYE employees.  If they are not, there is probably something amiss.  We know this from the construction sector.  That is not to say there cannot be some legitimate contractors in these areas.  Of course, there can.  However, one would expect the bulk of people in this situation to be PAYE workers and to accumulate rights.  One would expect to see a transfer of those PAYE employees and trainees from one production to the next and to see the companies receiving the relief taking responsibility for their workers.  Those are reasonable things and if they happened, it would resolve many of the problems.  It would improve the industry and its output and improve the lot of those working in it.  I am encouraged by the Government's response over the past while.  I hope it will follow through in the new year with the forum and the establishment of proper employee and trainee structures and ensure the full application of employee rights for the workers in the industry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100042#PP01300","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544558700,"counter":534,"content":"<p>The Minister might be able to explain a technical point.  I am trying to figure out why the opportunity was not taken to change the reference to the Irish Film Board to F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, or Screen Ireland.  It is strange when that is its name as set out in legislation and we are dealing here with an Irish Film Board change.  There may be some technicality I have overlooked.  I will not delay much as I have asked some of my questions already.<\/p>  <p>  Screen Ireland provided funding of &euro;281.66 million for the Irish film sector in 2017.  How much of that went to training or is there any separation out of that part of the funding spent on training?  That is one of the key issues.  We are trying to ensure that there are proper training and facilities but also that trainees will have proper contracts at the end of the process.  I have heard no one argue against the intent of the Bill or the changes to section 481.  All I have heard is Members seeking to ensure that any employment in this industry is quality employment.  If we have quality employment, we get a return on our investment.  Those who work in the industry would then have proper terms and conditions and benefits and it would improve things.  We are not trying to restrict or hamper small Irish companies availing of up to &euro;500 million in grant aid from Screen Ireland.  I have been informed that it should be easy to capture some of the abuse by way of a proper interrogation of the budgets submitted to F&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann.  It ought to be possible to identify whether a film's budget is realistic.  While we know some films run over schedule, a film should generally take a certain length of time to make and one should be able to identify the number of people employed on it.  From that information, it should be possible to work out if they have been paid the proper rates of compensation and the other standard contributions we expect in every other industry.  One should be able to determine whether it is a company designed to make a profit for the owners first and foremost rather than to look after the key workers on the film in question.<\/p>  <p>  A number of recommendations were made by the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I will not go through all of them.  Some of what I was trying to do involved allowing the Minister to try capture some of those by means of regulations, reports or one of the proposals in the three amendments.  I hoped one of those would be acceptable to the Minister to ensure that there is an ongoing understanding that we are not willing to accept a continuing failure by an industry which has been grant-aided and subsidised by tax relief to address the problems which have been exposed.  Some of those problems were set out in the report.  There may be merit in the Minister reconsidering and reverting to the House with a new Bill to address other small housekeeping aspects of the film industry, including its tax treatment, in the near future.  At least then, we could get properly to grips with the future of the film industry in Ireland, whether at the point of pre-legislative scrutiny or on Committee Stage.<\/p>  <p>  The industry is supposed to support the employment of nearly 17,000 people but I am informed that the latter is a huge exaggeration and that the number of persons employed in the industry is far lower.  Within that 17,000, I understand some people have been counted twice if not three times due to their employment across a number of film or television productions within a 12-month period.<\/p><p>It is a pity the amendments were ruled out of order.  If they had been accepted, we might have had a more specific and structured debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100043#QQ00200","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544559300,"counter":536,"content":"<p>The Minister, as the responsible office holder who is enabling funding for this industry to be increased from &euro;300 million to &euro;500 million, has failed to answer in any reasonable way in respect of areas for which she is responsible and which are currently the subject of significant scandal.  This scandal has the capacity to damage Ireland's international reputation at a time when there is general agreement in the country that we should support the film industry and seek to have it expanded.  It goes without saying that, for the sake of the people who train for, are educated for, and work in the industry, this funding should be increased in a way which looks at and faces the issues.  When one is a Minister, one is responsible for facing up to the problems in the sector and for seeking to alleviate and remedy them.  We have already seen an extensive programme devoted to the industry on RT&Eacute;.  We know from conversations we have had with different people that there are issues.  There is a common, united view in the House that this industry is well worth supporting and that it is really important for culture and identity both for Ireland and for newcomers to the country.  It is a powerful agent for projecting a vision of Ireland and our ambitions for what will happen to young people and older people.<\/p>  <p>  Despite this, the Minster has been completely silent as to how she is prepared to respond.  In a significant acknowledgement, she indicated that, with just seven members, the Irish Film Board is possibly too small.  I assume she means that it is therefore unrepresentative.  My guess would be that it is not sufficiently representative of the wide range of people who work in the industry, including people who are employed in the industry.  That is what we are talking about.<\/p>  <p>  I find it really strange that the two amendments relating to reports have been ruled out of order given that the Department of Finance has no difficulty dealing with reports.  Perhaps members of the Business Committee and other committees of the House should look at that because it is a very bad ruling.  It should be possible for the Oireachtas to seek to have reports dealing with pertinent issues which have been raised laid before us.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister did not say much at all that was not in the material included in the report on the industry in 2017.  I am certainly a very strong supporter of the cartoon industry.  It has done some great work and produced some wonderful films here.  It is for the Minister to be open to addressing legitimate issues in the industry in a creative way.  I am just not clear as to whether she has any standards at all.  She indicated that she acknowledges that people have legal rights.  She stated that they have these rights but this Bill deals with extensive access to funding and with how the industry is organised.  The context of the industry has been expanded to include, as the Minister outlined, audiovisual areas, cartoons and so on, but that is in response to what has actually been happening.  A huge amount of talent in the fields of film and cartooning has been nurtured in Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  What is the Minister saying to students who are going to graduate this year and who really want to work in this industry, which they love?  Will they have any opportunity to work under proper terms and conditions?  What we are asking for is in no way radical or revolutionary.  It simply makes sense.<\/p>  <p>  We are all equally aware that films are project-based.  This allows for a great deal of change in a creative industry, but it results in responsibilities to ensure that the people who are employed in the industry and the young people who are coming into it to make names for themselves are genuinely treated fairly and given good opportunities.  There is a responsibility to ensure that the quality of training and education in the industry is up to date, modern, and empowering because we want all of these people to be able to develop and use their talents to the maximum extent.<\/p>  <p>  I am very disappointed in the response of the Minister and her officials.  It is not the officials who make the policy, however.  It is the Minister who is responsible to the D&aacute;il for policy.  We are talking about an area in which it is known internationally that there is a policy problem.  We have all said how we might reasonably go about addressing that problem.  If the Minister is now thinking about expanding the board, perhaps she could tell us a little about how she sees that happening.  Is she to allow herself a period of reflection so that she can then expand the board and set up proper structures?  She has offered that.  Would the board be expanded to 11?  That would be four extra people.  Would she have people from the education area of the industry on the board?  Would she include people from the training and experience areas of the industries?  Would she include producers working in different areas of the industry?  The Minister has acknowledged that the board is somewhat small.  As there are only seven members and as it is an international industry, is it difficult to get many members of the board to attend meetings?  I would not be surprised if that was a problem.<\/p>  <p>  There should be a sub-committee.  People who are not members of the main board could also be appointed to the sub-committee so that we would really get decent oversight on this issue, which has caused some difficulties for the industry.  We all have goodwill towards expanding funding and loan capacity in the industry but we also want to see those areas - which, as I have stated, have been the subject of a great deal of discussion and a fair amount of scandal - addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100044#RR00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speech","time":1544559300,"counter":537,"content":"<p>A number of matters were raised.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to employment issues.  I have already mentioned the normal employment legislation which is there for any worker in any industry.  I also mentioned the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection's legislation which will be coming through and which should protect workers, namely, the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017.<\/p>  <p>  I am not sure whether it was Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh or Deputy Boyd Barrett who mentioned PAYE.  People in the audiovisual industry are employed under many arrangements.  There are employers, PAYE workers, sole traders, the self-employed and freelance workers.  As long as the arrangement is legal, all of these are legitimate.  Many people choose to work as non-PAYE workers.  They have a right to do so without fear or intimidation.<\/p>  <p>  I acknowledge Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments on the board.  I remind Deputies that we are looking at Screen Ireland this evening rather than at section 481.  The issues are being examined by Screen Ireland and my Department.<\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned capital expenditure, which typically is loans while current expenditure is administration costs and training.  I will arrange for information on training to be forwarded to him.  <\/p> <p> I disagree completely with Deputy Burton's comments.  I do not agree there is any scandal attached to this particular industry other than the workers matter, with which I will deal.  The Government is fully supportive of the industry.  That is clearly demonstrated by the significant commitment to it of &euro;200 million in the national development plan.  On my own behalf, I ask that the Deputy not personalise her comments.  I note the other Deputies did not do that.  Her comments such that I am not clear as to whether I have any standards are not necessary in a debate of this nature.  I am happy to answer questions but I would beg her indulgence not to personalise her comments.  <\/p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned the issue of employment by a qualifying company.  In order to apply for section 481 relief, there must be a qualifying company, which is also known as a designated activity company, or DAC.  The DAC must be a wholly owned subsidiary of a producer company and must incur, on the production of the qualifying film, at least the eligible expenditure amount as set out in the certification for section 481 tax relief.  When the project is completed a compliance report must be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners and following the submission of that compliance report, the DAC must continue in existence for at least 12 months.  After that, the company may be wound down via by members by a voluntary liquidation or a voluntary strike-off.  If there were outstanding liabilities or a claim against the DAC, an orderly wind-up of the company could not proceed until any outstanding liabilities were addressed.<\/p> <p> I agree with Deputy Burton about the quality of the graduates from Ballyfermot College of Further Education.  They usually have employment before they finish their studies.  I am confident they will enjoy excellent employment prospects in the sector into the future.<\/p> <p> Those are the main issues.  I thank the Deputies for their impassioned and valued contribution to this debate.  I know it is of extreme importance to all the Deputies that have contributed here this evening.  I was happy to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100044#RR00300","speaker":"1243","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544559900,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544559900,"counter":540,"content":"<p>Three amendments have been tabled by Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh, Burton and Boyd Barrett and others.

On the SPV structure, the problem is that it appears and it disappears.  That is a problem in terms of people's employment rights.  We need to re-examine that.  I just want to make that clear.  I am not going to elaborate the point as the officials understand it.  It is a particular structure.  There are reasons at one level that we should have it but it causes a problem in terms of the normal relationship between an employer and an employee that should exist.<\/p>  <p>  On the issue the Minister mentioned regarding people having the right to be freelancers and so on, my response to that is \"Yes\" and \"No\".  There is a control test.  There are documents which have been produced and I probably have one of them among my papers.  There are rules about the way employment, as against self-employment, is defined.  It is not a case of somebody saying he or she is a freelancer or a lone trader.  If a person's relationship to an employment ticks certain boxes that person is an employee.  That person is not a lone trader or a self-employed entrepreneur.  It is not accurate to say that.  These issues are set out in a code for practice for determining employment or self-employment.  We need to examine this area.   <\/p>  <p>  I understand that in some jurisdictions, such as France, at the beginning of a production officials from the equivalent of Revenue and the state ask the people involved what they do, what are their terms and conditions and they set out the way they will be categorised.  That is how it is done.  They go through every single employee and set out the way it is defined.  I will not go through them.  The officials will be aware of them.  <\/p>  <p>  In fairness to the Government, in response to campaigning in other areas such as construction, it has taken this issue on board, and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has stated we need to deal with issues such as bogus self-employment.  There has been an acknowledgement in other areas, particularly in the construction sector, that must be dealt with.  There are at least allegations, and I believe credible ones, that this is happening in the film industry.  Therefore, it must be examined.  That is not unreasonable.  That is how we get to the truth.  In any of these situations some people will allege one thing and others will allege another.  Our job, as public representatives and as representatives of the Government, is to find the facts, establish what the rules and the law are, ensure they are being applied and to make it clear to the stakeholders in the industry that these are the rules and this is the law.  The law must be complied with.  If we have to debate whether we should change laws in certain circumstances, let us do that.  I am simply arguing, as are I believe many people in the industry, that must be applied.  <\/p>  <p>  Some information is being gathered and some has been remitted to Revenue.  However, we need more information about who is working, what they are doing and so on.  We need to know what sort of tax remittances we are getting.  I will not elaborate the point further.

I thank colleagues for their co-operation in allowing me to advance this legislation, having introduced it earlier this autumn.  I will first give a technical breakdown of the proposals by addressing the various sections.  The Bill provides that people who suffered as a result of maternal ingestion of thalidomide are not excluded from pursuing their cases because of time limits in the Statue of Limitations 1957.  The Bill amends the Statute of Limitations 1957, Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991 and Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 2000.  It inserts into the Acts that a person shall &quot;in respect of injuries suffered by that person as a result of the ingestion of Thalidomide by that person&rsquo;s mother during the person&rsquo;s gestation period&quot; be deemed to be under a disability.  This section would apply to actions referred to in subsection (1) where the action concerned accrued before or after the passing of this Act, including actions pending the passage of this Bill.  The section is in addition to and is not a substitute for section 48 of the Statute of Limitations Act.<\/p><p>It is important to state clearly that the primary focus of this Bill is to give victims of thalidomide a right of action.  Unfortunately, the statute is currently being used as the primary wall of defence by the co-defendants in this case.  However, the Bill states in section 1(2):<\/p><blockquote>Nothing in section 48B of the Statute of Limitations, 1957, (inserted by <i>subsection (1)<\/i>), shall be construed as affecting any power of a court to dismiss an action on the ground of there being such delay between the accrual of the cause of action and the bringing of the action as, in the interests of justice, would warrant its dismissal.<\/blockquote><p>The lifetime of thalidomide survivors has been blighted by the consequences of a drug taken by their mothers when they were <i>in utero<\/i>.  The survivors were born with injuries that have an exceptional level of effect.  People have had to endure significant physical and psychological consequences of their injuries for nearly 50 years.  I welcome many of the survivors in the Gallery.  Hopefully, we can finally provide some hope and justice in their long struggle against the State and the company involved, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal.<\/p><p>The background to this case is important because it demonstrates a dark past, particularly in respect of the company, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal, which marketed and promoted the thalidomide drug after the Second World War.  As people are aware, the thalidomide catastrophe is an example of a shameful cover-up by big pharma across the world.  Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal, which manufactured this drug, is still in existence and is the defendant in many of the cases currently before the High Court.  It has been argued that the Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal thalidomide catastrophe is one of the last remaining war secrets.  The chemist in charge of research was Dr. Heinrich M&uuml;ckter, who was also a medical officer in Poland during the Nazi occupation of the country.  The founder of the company, Hermann Wirtz, came from a prosperous family which had been given two Jewish firms in the 1930s as part of the Aryanisation programme and emerged with the cash and contacts to establish this company, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal.  In the 1950s, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal ignored German regulations about new drugs and appropriate testing, carrying out only limited clinical trials.  A culture of profit superseded safety to the detriment of thousands of people born across the world who were left with disabilities.<\/p><p>In 1956, long before thalidomide was marketed in Ireland, concerns were raised about the drug when the baby of a Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal worker who had been given the drug was born without ears.  Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal ignored this case, among others, to develop its blockbuster drug for profit.  This reflected the prevailing culture after the Second World War.  The company ignored warning signs for years as it pursued profits.  A German judge described the company's actions as &quot;negligent, misleading, inexcusable, unlawful&quot; and &quot;very inadequate by the standards of the day&quot;.  Unfortunately, the State  took a hands-off, <i>laissez-faire<\/i>approach in the 1960s and did not exercise its statutory functions under the Health Act to address concerns about thalidomide which had been flagged across Europe and beyond.  The drug's recall was delayed as a result and carried out in a ham-fisted manner.  Unlike other jurisdictions, the State took no action in 1961 to restrict the sale and distribution of the drug when other countries were doing so.  The Whelehan Group, the distributor of the drug in Ireland, acted in a similar manner to the State by not proactively addressing a red flag that was spreading throughout Europe.  The company took a hands-off approach to informing doctors and pharmacists, issuing a circular warning them of the emerging public evidence about the drug.  The State and Whelehan delayed the drug's recall and a lack of information resulted in ongoing use of the drug which adversely affected many people.<\/p><p>There is documentary evidence in the Department of Health which demonstrates that flags were being raised in Tullamore, Ballinasloe and other parts of the country about the effects of the drug.  The circular issued at the time did not warn people.  The effects were being seen on the ground without any action by the Whelehan Group or the State.  A confidential but questionable circular was issued to chief medical officers but there is no clarity about who was contacted and in what area, and whether the medication had been recalled and subsequently retrieved.  The evidence suggests it was left on the shelves long after the official recall.  There is evidence to suggest that the failure to properly recall thalidomide, even after the international withdrawal of the drug, demonstrated a shocking failure by the State and the distribution company, the Whelehan Group, to act quickly in citizens' best interests.<\/p><p>This is the backdrop to the ongoing struggle of thalidomide survivors.  The State's failure to honour a promised healthcare package in 1975 meant there was no follow-through on the provision of care adaptations, special equipment, education, training opportunities and healthcare supports.  The State, through the Irish Thalidomide Medical Assessment Board of the 1960s, failed to acknowledge many people who were injured through the ingestion of thalidomide by their mothers.<\/p><p>Some 50 years later, sufferers are still emerging owing to a degree of covering up of the existence of records.  Sadly, my legislation will come too late for two of the litigants before the courts who have passed away since their action began four years ago.  I hope the Government and Minister will take this on board.  This Bill gives those who are taking actions the ability to take their cases forward.  The quantification of damages in the 1970s bore no relationship to the injuries sustained or the losses incurred.  The State also failed to take the so-called settlement in the 1970s to be approved by the High Court, which was contrary to SI 72 of 1962, order 22, rule 9(2).  It is important to put that on record.  Damages proposed at the time were an insult and were generic, without proper personal injury precedents being followed, for the purpose of quantifying the entitlements of thalidomide survivors.  The effect of the absence of a court ruling meant that an Irish court has not considered why children in Ireland continue to be injured after the international date of the withdrawal of thalidomide, whether the State failed under the Health Act to regulate the distribution of thalidomide and whether the German and Irish settlements met the threshold and precedent for the quantification and extent of the personal injury and loss sustained.  As a result of the failure to rule on the settlements, many survivors have not received the benefit of the lump sum or even the healthcare benefits.  If it had been approved by the High Court as it was in the UK, it would have enforced the limited benefits that were provided for in the settlement but for many, this did not even occur.<\/p><p>The entire lifetime of thalidomide survivors has been blighted by the consequence of a drug taken by their mothers.  The survivors were born with injuries which, as I mentioned, have had an exceptional effect over 50 years.  They have shown great stoicism and bravery in overcoming their disabilities to achieve so much in their lives.  They demonstrate such courage and success.  I have met many of them in recent weeks and months.  They are very courageous and positive and they want justice.  That the Government has been trying to technically knock out thalidomide litigants with time limits in a case management action in the High Court is shameful and wrong.  New thalidomide victims who emerged since the 1960s, as well as people not acknowledged as survivors then, remain unacknowledged by the HSE and Minister for Health.  These people have never received any entitlements from the State associated with their injuries.  They should have the right to make their case if they can and they should not be locked out by a technical timing issue.  It is not right for them to be stopped from taking their cases by the Statute of Limitations.  They deserve the right to pursue their action.  Even with the proposed change, they will still have to prove their cases, which will not be easy, given the time that has elapsed since the 1960s.<\/p><p>Thalidomide survivors have been subjected to threats by way of court applications that their claims will be struck out on the grounds of timing and failure to provide medical records details.  The State is being intransigent and difficult with thalidomide survivors, which is shameful, given what befell them.  Furthermore, this House is being told that the reason the litigation is not resolved is that payments of compensation would become deductible from German or Irish state pension entitlements.  That statement is inaccurate.  These litigants have never received any compensation or pension entitlement, or any thalidomide related benefit, from the State.  A 2010 State Claims Agency report on the thalidomide controversy was fundamentally flawed and the State has held on to an entrenched position because of this.  The report did not acknowledge that thalidomide had remained on the Irish market for several years after the date of knowledge that it posed a risk.  Like the cervical cancer cover-up of this century, in the previous century pregnant women who ingested thalidomide were never told that their unborn babies could have been injured <i>in utero<\/i>.  Why Ireland neglected to withdraw and recall thalidomide in a timely manner back in the 1960s has never been explained.<br\/><br\/>In its 2010 report the State Claims Agency states it is inappropriate, in its view, to apply current principles of tort and quantum to an event which took place in the years from 1958 to 1962.  The perspective of this agency of the State that because justice in terms of quantification of losses in regard to damages did not occur many years ago and since has been delayed, the survivors have no appropriate entitlement today to losses is an insult.  It appears to the agency that justice delayed should be justice denied and, shamefully, it is defending on that basis.  That undermines an important principle of justice and due process.  When faced with the hepatitis C and HIV victims from the 1970s, the State acted in a different way.  <br\/><br\/>On 31 July 2013 the State again made a generic offer without quantification of damages and liability and tried to bounce survivors into a deal which did not address the core issues in the ongoing dispute.  This has been described by survivors as the night of the long knives.  Unlike in the aftermath of the cervical cancer controversy, no funding has been delivered to the HSE by the Minister for Health or his Department to enable it to provide the necessary medical records for thalidomide litigants.  The Minister has a conflict in this matter.  One one side, he underfunds the HSE's facilities for the provision of medical records, with the consequent effect that thalidomide litigants are placed in a vulnerable position in that their cases could be struck out for a failure to provide medical records.  On the other side, the Minister is a defendant in the very same court proceedings.  It is, therefore, within his remit to cure the issue on which advantage is being sought in terms of litigation.  The Minister and his Department need to end this regrettable and hurtful approach of sympathising with victims, on the one hand, and blocking their progress and right of action, on the other.  Actions speak louder than words, particularly for victims of thalidomide.  In this action by the thalidomide survivors, in excess of 1,100 court documents have had to be filed thus far.  Thousands of medical records have been sought by the defendants and the Minister from the survivors.  As the hospital system's ability to deliver them is very limited, the litigants are in a catch-22.  <br\/><br\/>I have given a broad outline of the Bill and the history and struggle of the victims.  They should not be left in a precarious scenario of case management and a technical knock out to prevent their cases from being heard.  It is ironic that the State Claims Agency and Gr&uuml;nenthal, a company with dubious foundations in Nazi Germany, are relying on the same defence to block genuine victims who were all failed by the co-defendants.  Justice delayed should not mean justice denied.  It is time to remove the Statute of Limitations for these victims in order that their cases can proceed and justice can be aired in the courts system.  I urge Members across the House to support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100046#TT00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544561100,"counter":557,"content":"<p>I welcome the visitors to the Visitors Gallery and commend Deputy Jack Chambers on bringing forward this Bill which deals with an issue in which I know he passionately believes.  He is a strong advocate for those who have suffered immense harm owing to the scandal of thalidomide.  He has laid out in great detail a litany of State failures not only from the 1960s but up until now and which continue to be perpetrated by the State.  The Bill seeks to rectify it and I am happy that Fianna F&aacute;il is using its Private Members' time to bring forward the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The mothers and fathers affected by the thalidomide disaster wanted more than anything to protect their babies; love them, nurture them and, above all, keep them safe.  One of the many cruelties of the thalidomide disaster was that the mothers were given a supposedly mild, safe morning sickness pill for pregnant women.  The drug, as we know, was called thalidomide.  We are familiar with the devastating effects it had on their children.  When the truth finally emerged, that thalidomide had caused severe disabilities in children, one would think the State would have stepped in and done everything it could have to help the children and their parents, but, as laid out by Deputy Jack Chambers, it did not step in to help.  Not only did it not step in to help, it quickly became part of the problem.  <\/p>  <p>  The drug was withdrawn from Irish pharmacies long after it had been withdrawn in other European countries.  The Medical Assessment Board of the 1960s refused to acknowledge many of the victims.  During the years it transpired that patient files had been hidden.  The State has been fairly accused of being involved in a serious and sinister cover-up.  For decades many of the thalidomide victims have been denied help and compensation.  To this day, the State continues to work against the victims of thalidomide to frustrate their efforts to seek justice.  The Bill before us fights back on their behalf.<\/p>  <p>  To this day the State Claims Agency is a co-defendant with the drug company.  The State is claiming that the victims cannot avail of justice through the courts because of the Statute of Limitations.  Despite causing numerous pauses in the process, in which the State was complicit, the State and the drug company are claiming that for these victims it is too late.  They are being told \"tough luck\" and \"you are out of time.\"  We say it is not too late.  The Bill seeks to provide that it is not too late.  We say it is not too late to make amends or show compassion.  We say it is not too late for the State to say thalidomide survivors' legal cases can and will be heard and will not be thrown out on a legal technicality.  It is my hope other Members of the Oireachtas in government and opposition will join us in that call and support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  We want the Government to amend the Statute of Limitations specifically and only in this case for the victims of thalidomide.  We want it to include in the existing Act one sentence that could throw open the doors to these victims and indicate to them that the State is no longer going to get in their way and that they can avail of justice through the courts.  The Bill seeks to insert the following: \"A person shall, in respect of injuries suffered by that person as a result of the ingestion of thalidomide by that person&rsquo;s mother during the person&rsquo;s gestation period, be deemed to be under a disability\".  That is all it would take to grant access to justice for these men and women.  <\/p>  <p>  There are many aspects of our past for which we need to make amends and we are discovering more of them every year.  It must never be too late to do the right thing or for victims to seek justice.  Let us offer thalidomide victims the protection and compassion they have been cruelly denied for so long.  Let us allow them to go to court and facilitate them in doing so by making sure the resources are in place in order that they can access their files or whatever else they need.  At a minimum, they deserve to be heard in court and the courts will decide in whatever way they choose.<\/p><p>Rather than tell these men and women that regardless of what happened to them and what was done to them they will not have access to justice or their day in court simply because the case has exceeded the Statute of Limitations, let us remove it in this limited case and give these men and women access to the justice they deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100047#UU00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544561700,"counter":559,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Jack Chambers for bringing forward this important legislation.  I wish to emphasise the central role of the Statute of Limitations in ensuring a fair system of litigation.  However, let us have truth and honesty in this debate and let us deal with the facts from both a legal point of view and a humanitarian point of view.  That is important.  Despite my personal view, the Government is opposing the proposed amendment for the reasons I will outline.  This Bill would give rise to civil litigation that could not otherwise be prosecuted before the courts, resulting in the appropriation of public moneys to fund the costs of the courts and other costs associated with litigation.  The Bill therefore requires a money message in accordance with Article 17 of the Constitution.<\/p><p>The Department of Justice and Equality is the sponsoring Department for the Statute of Limitations Act 1957.  The Act provides for limitation periods within which litigation can be brought.  The Act recognises that a balance must be drawn between allowing litigants to make their claims and at the same time serving the public good by setting definite timeframes within which litigation can be taken against any person in the State.  Due to the great importance of serving the public good, the Act grants extensions of time to limited cohorts who are described in the Act as &quot;under a disability&quot;.  It would run against the principle of protecting the common good to grant extensions of time to a cohort which does not meet the criteria for being granted this extension.  The Department of Health considers that the amendment proposed has the potential for significant negative repercussions for the State as a defendant in litigation, as it would set a clear precedent for diluting the criteria defining what it is to be under a disability to such a degree as to make these criteria meaningless.<\/p><p>This Private Members Bill seeks to amend the Statute of Limitations Act to deem thalidomide survivors to be &quot;under a disability&quot; for the purposes of the statute, with retrospective effect.  All of those currently recognised within the statute as &quot;under a disability&quot; are greatly impaired in their ability to take proceedings.  That is why extensions of the limitation period apply in their cases.  However, those persons whose injuries are attributable to thalidomide are not generally under severe legal disability which has impeded them from taking proceedings.  The overall operation of the law in respect of the Statute of Limitations is complex and any changes to it will have a wide impact in law.  This key area of the law is, therefore, a matter of ongoing review at the Department of Justice and Equality.  This process is taking account of the findings and recommendations of the 2011 Law Reform Commission report and intervening developments.<\/p><p>In the ongoing consideration of the overall operation of the law relating to the limitation of actions or where specific areas of policy action arise, the core objectives of the Law Reform Commission report of 2011 will continue to apply, namely, that, &quot;A balance is struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as having regard to the public interest; in particular the right of the plaintiff of access to the courts and the right to litigate, the right of the defendant to a speedy trial and to fair procedures, as well as the public interest in the avoidance of delayed claims and the timely administration of justice.&quot;  Account will continue to be taken by the Department of Justice and Equality of the commission&rsquo;s recommendations and other relevant developments in bringing forward any proposals for reforming legislation in this area including, possibly, as part of any new programme of legislation and with the careful consideration of the Attorney General.<\/p><p>With regard to some of the points made about the State not stepping forward, I will take this opportunity to outline briefly some of the background to the current provision of State supports to Irish survivors of thalidomide, which I have always supported.  Thalidomide is a drug that was marketed in this country between 1958 and 1962.  It was withdrawn from sale by the manufacturers because it was linked to disabilities in children born to mothers who had taken the drug during their pregnancy.  In January 1975, the Irish Government announced its decision to grant an <i>ex gratia<\/i>sum equivalent to four times the German lump sum and an <i>ex gratia<\/i>monthly allowance for life equal to the German monthly allowance from the Contergan Foundation to each of the children found to have thalidomide related injuries.  This decision reflected the deep sympathy with which the Government always considered the effects of this tragedy on the lives of the children and their families.  This is something I have always supported.<\/p><p>There are a number of other measures for thalidomide survivors.  The Irish survivors have a full medical card which does not take means into account and provides access to a full range of primary care, hospital and personal social care.  A HSE national thalidomide liaison provides assistance with securing HSE-provided health and social care services, access services and supports provided by other Government agencies, for example, housing adaptation grants from local authorities.  It is open to anybody who believes that his or her injuries are attributable to thalidomide to be assessed by the Contergan Foundation to establish his or her status.  Obviously the State would recognise the outcome of this process and extend them the same supports.<\/p><p>Finally, without prejudice, the Minister for Health intends to refer shortly to the Government with proposed draft heads of a Bill regarding health and personal social services for Irish survivors of thalidomide.  I look forward to the House's support for these proposals.  We listen and we will support in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100048#VV00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1544561700,"counter":560,"content":"<p>I welcome to the Public Gallery members of the Irish Thalidomide Association.  I welcome victims, family members and litigants and hope that passing this Bill will help them address the great wrong that was visited upon them and upon those who have passed, without ever knowing justice, all the while with the full knowledge of the Irish State.  More worrying, but not surprising, is the fact that yet again the Irish State tried to bury the scandal and deny these victims their voice.  It is reprehensible that we are debating once again an issue concerning a medical scandal and a subsequent cover-up that has destroyed people's lives.  To be frank, it sends shivers up my spine.  What kind of State and society are we when we repeatedly find ourselves in these situations?  When will we learn the lessons?<\/p>  <p>  Thalidomide was given to pregnant mothers in this country in the late 1950s as a sedative and treatment for morning sickness.  In November 1961, it was discovered by an Australian gynaecologist that thalidomide was responsible for causing profound deformities of body and mind in children born to mothers who had been taking the drug.  Despite most countries ceasing the use of thalidomide at that point, it remained on the market in Ireland until as late as June 1962.  This pattern is all too familiar, with similar scandals such as the anti-D product, haemophiliacs' contaminated blood products, transvaginal mesh and, most recently, the cervical cancer screening scandal.  We react far too late when these scandals are discovered and then treat the victims disgracefully.  We impose the weight of the State upon them to prevent them pursuing the justice they richly deserve.  We see the result of this tonight.<\/p>  <p>  These victims, numbering 26, who have cases outstanding are waiting more than 50 years to be compensated adequately.  The case is at a standstill in the High Court, with Mr. Justice Seamus Noonan criticising the slow pace of proceedings with no prospect of progress in the medium term.  The defendant company, Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal, is sitting behind a 1970s settlement and the Statute of Limitations.<\/p><p>I commend Deputy Jack Chambers on attempting to address this blockage here tonight.  It is a commendable piece of work that is a genuine attempt to deliver for these people.  I assure Jack and I assure this Chamber that its passage will have my and my party's full and unconditional support.  I want to record my horror at the Government's decision to oppose the Bill.<\/p> <p> I wish to place on the record an unfolding similar scandal that concerns the drug valproate, which is used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorders.  It has, similarly, caused birth defects in newborns when their expectant mothers have taken the drug.  A European-wide ban on the use of valproate during pregnancy is now in place since 31 May 2018, following a safety review carried out by the European Commission that resulted in a legally binding decision.<\/p> <p> I welcome that there are now in place an awareness programme, pre-assessments and explicit warnings for women at risk.  I further welcome that work is under way to review the diagnostic and support services required by people who may have been affected by foetal anti-convulsant syndrome, FACS.  It scares me to recognise the similarities involved in the case of valproate and thalidomide.   On 6 July 2017 France banned the use of valproate for expectant mothers.  It is estimated that 4,100 births with defects arose from the use of this drug in France.  Since late 2017 France has set up a compensation fund to begin addressing the needs of victims.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, would update the House tonight or at some point in the very near future on where Ireland stands on this drug and the mark it has left on the lives of how many of our citizens.<\/p> <p> I will conclude by once again assuring Deputy Chambers and this Chamber that we in Sinn F&eacute;in will assist in the passage of tonight's Bill through Second Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100048#VV00300","speaker":"1269","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544562300,"counter":562,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Chambers for bringing forward this Bill.  As my colleague Teachta &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has outlined, Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the Bill wholeheartedly.<\/p>  <p>  While the Bill is short and simple, it is an extremely important Bill.  It addresses issues that many people will be familiar with.  Although the group is small the thalidomide issue is very well known and the arguments very well rehearsed.  Thalidomide was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  It was withdrawn from the market in 1961 but it would be 2012 before the manufacturer, the Gr&uuml;nenthal Group, would issue a halfhearted and insincere apology.  For 50 years they were silent.  All the while people had to live with the consequences of what this drug had done to them.  Families and friends had to live with it too.  What was the role of the State during this whole process? It was to issue what at best could be called an ineffective recall of the drug once the devastating side effects became apparent.  It was only a number of years ago that a \"Prime Time\" investigation exposed that the Government deliberately did not issue a public warning about the dangers of thalidomide because it believed such a move would be undesirable.  The documents uncovered by that programme showed that the Government decided not to make a public announcement about the dangers of the drug and instead left it up to pharmacists and medical officers to withdraw it from the shelves.  Given the roles they played in the creation and perpetuation of this scandal, one would have thought that the Gr&uuml;nenthal Group and the State would acknowledge in full the damage and the hurt they have caused and that they would do all they could to set things right.  In 2018, however, with all that we know and all that we have found out, we have both the State and the Gr&uuml;nenthal Group trying to use the Statute of Limitations to deny the victims access to compensation.<\/p>  <p>  I am rarely shocked in my job, but I am shocked that the Government is opposing this Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to reflect on that and to perhaps come to a different conclusion.  It is clear that with the State and the Gr&uuml;nenthal Group using the Statute of Limitations Act 1957 to deny these victims, the correct course of action for us as legislators is to amend the Statute of Limitations Act.  I commend Deputy Chambers on giving us the opportunity to do that.  The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2018 seeks to amend the 1957 Act, specifically section 48 which relates to disability.  The State should not be in league with big pharma and it should not allow the companies to dodge their responsibilities when it comes to payment of compensation.  It is our job to fight for those affected and to hold power to account and that is what we must do in this instance.<\/p>  <p>  Speaking on this Bill tonight I am reminded of those children also affected due to the use of Epilim during pregnancy.  When the Minister of State looks back on the history of thalidomide he will see, as I did when preparing my remarks for this evening, that the parallels are shocking.  This tells me that no lessons have been learned and that we are not capable of looking back and seeing a copy of what happened.  There are so many similarities in the situations.  I echo the call made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I urge the Minister of State to examine the issue because of these parallels.  Day after day we come in here and talk about scandals of the past.  We all nod our heads and say: \"We are absolutely certain that it will not happen again.\"  We talk about the Magdalen laundries yet we have direct provision.  Now we are talking about a historical injustice but actually the same injustice is being perpetuated.  The regulators knew about the risk with sodium valproate when they were considering licensing the drug.  The women were not warned that the epilepsy drug could cause birth defects and developmental problems in their babies.  Sinn F&eacute;in is very proud to be active on this issue, which we have taken on.  I look at the history and I see that history is about to repeat itself in a very shocking way.  We should all be listening to those alarm bells.<\/p>  <p>  The victims of thalidomide should, at the very least, have the right for their case to be heard before the court.  I do not believe this is an unreasonable request.  For a group of people who have the sympathy of the general public, and for whom we all want the very best, the very least they deserve is the opportunity to have their case heard in court.  That is why we should ensure the Bill is passed.<\/p>  <p>  The State, through the now defunct Irish Thalidomide Medical Board in the 1960s, failed outright to acknowledge many of those who were injured through the ingestion of thalidomide by their mothers.  After 50 years victims are still emerging as a consequence of the cover-up of patient records.  The role of the State over the past 50 years has been despicable.  Successive Governments have failed to address this issue.  Less than ten years ago, a previous Minister for Health, former Deputy Mary Harney offered a take it or leave it package of &euro;2 million to be shared equally between the 32 survivors at the time, and a slight increase in the monthly payment.  That was not good enough for the then Minister.  It represented a continuation of the State's failure to do the right thing.  As has been pointed out previously, this is not a growing number of people.  Those affected do not have time on their side.  This group is, regrettably, diminishing in numbers so this is a very time sensitive issue.  It is wrong to use the Statute of Limitations against this group.  I know the Minister of State was very genuine in his words and I urge him to reflect on whether it might be possible to support the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I commend Deputy Chambers on bringing this short, very simple, but very important and necessary legislation to the House this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100049#WW00200","speaker":"1302"},{"type":"speech","time":1544562900,"counter":563,"content":"<p>I compliment Deputy Jack Chambers on bringing forward this very precise legislation which I have no difficulty in supporting.  I know the Minister of State to be very personable, but I, too, am shocked by the content and delivery of his speech and the ferocity with which he has told us that the Government will not be supporting the Bill.  If he is listening, I remind him that he spoke about a balance having to be struck between the competing rights of the plaintiff and the defendant.  That is precisely what has been missing.  There has been no balancing of rights.  We have had the powerful against people with no power.  The Minister of State's failure to grasp this and the content and manner of delivery of his speech are shocking.  I might have misunderstood him at the end of it, but did he say he was bringing forward legislation to be of further assistance?  That is what I heard, but perhaps I am wrong.  Certainly, if that is the case, it should have been brought forward well before now, not 50 to 60 years after the event.<\/p>  <p>  The apology given by Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal was miserly, delayed until 2012 and only given to the survivors, those suffering from thalidomide injuries.  It was never given to the mothers who had suffered on every level having given birth to children with serious defects, not to mention the guilt felt having taken the medication which was sold on the markets as being safe.  Before coming into the House, I took the trouble of looking back to see how the drug had been advertised.  It was advertised using images of the happy faces of children and mothers who were repeatedly told that it was a safe drug and encouraged to take it.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and we received an update in the past few months, starting in July.  We were told that there were 34 active thalidomide related cases.  That figure is included in the State Claims Agency's annual report.  All of the people in question were born between 1958 and 1962.  It is difficult over 50 years later to convince the Government that it should do the right thing.  Throughout his speech the Minister of State talked about the common good, but the Government utterly fails to realise what it is.<\/p>  <p>  We are dealing with a very limited number of people and a very precise Bill that simply seeks to remove one of the obstacles for a group of people who should not have to go to court in the first place.  In going to court they should not have to override this obstacle because of the passage of time.  In his contribution the Minister of State did nothing to right the situation.  There are very few grounds for opposing the legislation.  <\/p>  <p>  I will clarify a number of things that we sought to clarify at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We were led to believe, perhaps inadvertently, that mediation was ongoing and it was clarified that there had been no mediation meetings for almost two solid years, since 20 December 2016.  We know that some people who suffer from thalidomide have received absolutely no benefits; therefore, the argument by Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal that benefits would be affected and the argument by the Government do not stand up.  We know that thalidomide status is being challenged in a number of cases, which just beggars belief.  We know that the 1975 agreement was never ruled on in court and it is a very serious issue.  It seems that even the advice of the Attorney General at the time was ignored.  We know that the agreement in 2012-13, following on from a report which had been commissioned, I think, by the former Minister Mary Harney, recommended the payment of a sum of &euro;62,500.  As I understand it, the report was carried out with absolutely no consultation with the families or those suffering from thalidomide.<\/p>  <p>  We know that the State has not been innocent in all of this and that it will be for the courts to decide, but a wiser Government would make decisions in the common good and having learned from all of the debacles of the various health scandals.  However, the Government seems to be failing singularly to learn from them.  This is a golden opportunity to learn from people suffering from thalidomide because certainly they have an awful lot to teach me and the D&aacute;il about surviving with dignity and going on to lead full lives.  That their disability is not classified as a disability for the purposes of this legislation is difficult to accept.  It is difficult to accept - this is the third time I have said it - or believe the Minister of State made the speech he has made.  Some 50 years on we have learned absolutely nothing.  We are forcing people into court.  We were told initially at the Committee of Public Accounts, again, perhaps inadvertently, that it was the German company Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal that was raising the issue of the Statute of Limitations.  It was clarified that it was not doing so on it own, that the Government was also making the same argument in this case.  I have no idea why mediation has not continued, but it is important to state it has not.  I would like to think we have learned, but we have not.  I have absolutely no hesitation in supporting this limited legislation and would much prefer to see us discussing a scheme for those who have led the way with dignity and show us how things should be done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100050#XX00100","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1544562900,"counter":564,"content":"<p>I thank colleagues for their submissions and all of the valid points made, to which, of course, I listened.  It should be reiterated that it is not within the remit of the Minister for Health to amend the Statute of Limitations.  That is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality who would be advised by the Attorney General on any amendment that might be considered.  The overall operation of the law as it affects the Statute of Limitations is complex and any change would have a wide impact in law.<\/p><p>As I outlined to the House earlier, the purpose of the Statute of Limitations is to allow all persons, including the State, the opportunity to order their affairs in order that after a reasonable period has passed, persons will potential have no liability for events that occurred in the past.  The Statute of Limitations recognises that a balance needs to be struck between allowing litigants to make their claims and protecting all defendants, including the State, from old claims.  It is a very important point that the statute is properly not regarded as providing a technical defence, as reported in some media articles, but is, in fact, a central feature of a fair system of litigation.<\/p><p>While the Government genuinely has every sympathy for each person who has injuries attributable to thalidomide, it also must be cognisant of the constitutional rights of all parties in litigation.  Operating the Statute of Limitations differently in different classes of litigation could offend the fundamental constitutional requirement that the State treat such classes equally in its handling of litigation.<\/p><p>There are a number of legal claims against the State and two other parties in respect of thalidomide.  These claims were referred to the State Claims Agency which has delegated authority to manage litigation on behalf of the State.  I emphasise that the Minister for Health has no role in these legal proceedings.  The litigation is being case managed in the High Court.<\/p><p>There are different categories of thalidomide litigant.  In 2012 the Department of Health received claims from solicitors acting on behalf of 22 of the 30 Irish recipients of the monthly <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments.  Also in 2012 two of the 22 plaintiffs accepted the <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment offer of &euro;62,500.<\/p><p>In 2013, following the introduction of a revised German law, the Contergan Foundation significantly increased the German allowances payable to thalidomide survivors worldwide, including Irish survivors.  However, the German ministry confirmed that from 1 August 2013 onward, any financial payments made by other governments to thalidomide survivors will be offset against the new increased German payments.<br\/><br\/>Of the 22 Irish individuals who were in receipt of the monthly <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from the Irish State and had initiated legal proceedings, six opted to take the individual sum of &euro;62,500 previously offered prior to the 1 August 2013 deadline in full and final settlement of monetary compensation.  As two of these 22 had already accepted an <i>ex gratia<\/i>offer of &euro;62,500 in 2012, there are now 14 active litigation cases from this cohort.  The remaining nine Irish thalidomide survivors in receipt of monthly <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from the Irish State and who did not serve and-or issue legal proceedings, were offered and accepted <i>ex gratia<\/i>sums of &euro;62,500.<br\/><br\/>Additional claims have been received from solicitors on behalf of 13 persons not in receipt of monthly <i>ex gratia<\/i>payments from the State.  All of these claims have been referred to the State Claims Agency.  Of these, ten have initiated personal injuries litigation.  To the Department&rsquo;s knowledge and to my knowledge, only one of these persons has been found to have injuries attributable to thalidomide.  This person did not accept the State&rsquo;s offer of supports.  The House will appreciate that the Department cannot comment in detail on claims that are <i>sub judice.<\/i><br\/><br\/>The Government is committed to ensuring that the particular needs of survivors continue to be met in a person-centred manner.  The Government and its predecessors have sought to reflect the great sympathy of the Irish people for survivors of thalidomide by making special supports available through direct financial assistance, enhanced social supports and personal health services.<br\/><br\/>Today, 30 Irish survivors of thalidomide are in receipt of monthly payments from the Irish State for life, in addition to a wide range of health services, personal social care supports and other supports as required, for example housing adaptations and customised aids and appliances.  The range of services and financial supports provided to survivors, as outlined in more detail earlier this evening, are specifically provided to people whose injuries are attributable to thalidomide.<br\/><br\/>The Irish Thalidomide Medical Board was set up in 1973 as an independent board to undertake the examination of Irish children who claimed to have disabilities attributable to thalidomide, to assist their parents who may have a claim against the German compensation fund.  It also assessed their degree of permanent incapacity and necessary treatment.<br\/><br\/>A report of the board states that 112 children were examined by the board and the board determined that 34 Irish children had thalidomide-related injuries.  Irish children who were found to have thalidomide-related injuries were eligible for compensation from the German compensation fund in the form of a lump-sum payment and an allowance for life.  Of the original 34 persons found to have injury attributable to thalidomide, one person was accepted by the UK Thalidomide Trust, and sadly three persons are now deceased.<br\/><br\/>In 2008 the Contergan Foundation was not accepting applications from persons seeking to establish if their injuries were thalidomide related.  The Irish State paid for five persons to be assessed in the EX-Center, Stockholm, Sweden.  Three of these people had previously been assessed by the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board and again were deemed not to have injuries related to thalidomide.  Of the remaining two, one was found to have thalidomide-related injuries.<br\/><br\/>The Contergan Foundation has confirmed that since 2013 it is accepting applications from individuals for compensation for thalidomide-related injuries.  It is open, therefore, to any person who feels their injuries are attributable to thalidomide to contact the Contergan Foundation directly.  The House can be assured that any person whose application has been assessed and accepted by the Contergan Foundation will be eligible for the full range of supports, services and payments currently provided to Irish survivors by this State.<br\/><br\/>The Government welcomes this opportunity to assure the House of its continuing commitment to survivors of thalidomide and to explain in detail the reasons for the decision of Government to oppose the amendments proposed in the Private Members' Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100050#XX00200","speaker":"1359","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544563500,"counter":566,"content":"<p>The remarks my colleagues made outline how shameful and inhumane the Minister of State's two speeches tonight have been.  While he mentioned at the start he was not speaking personally, maybe he should speak personally.  Maybe he should front up as the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, and leave a positive legacy on these people's lives.  Maybe he should not have delivered that script because what we have seen from him was a continuity of the net defence, the brick wall, the reliance on the Statute of Limitations and a really shameful defence of the lack of action by the State.<\/p><p>He did not take into account what I said in my opening remarks about the quantification of damages by the failure of the State to remove the drug.  While he mentioned that the State has an ongoing commitment to these survivors, what he outlined today is very worrying.  It is an ongoing alliance between the State Claims Agency and a company with a very dark past.  This is a multi-billion euro company that sought to cover up documented evidence.  The State Claims Agency and the Minister for Health, mentioned in that court action, are rocking in and using the Statute of Limitations to block the people here from pursuing their court action.<\/p><p>While using the Statute of Limitations, the Minister of State has superseded that with the next defence - Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in can vouch for this as we have seen it at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality - the old money message.  What he is bringing to a conclusion is what we have specifically referenced in the Bill, which is that we are not prejudicing a potential court action.  I reject the Minister of State's claim that the Bill would give rise to civil litigation that could not otherwise be prosecuted before the courts, resulting in the appropriation of public moneys.  We have been very clear about giving someone a right of action.  The Minister of State is going directly to the conclusion because he knows damn well beyond the brick wall, beyond this defence, the State is exposed.  However, by allowing this defence to remain he is also allowing the brick wall to remain for that company, Gr&uuml;nenthal, a company that has failed to deliver for victims of thalidomide.<\/p><p>The Minister of State mentioned very little of the company in his two statements.  By opposing this Bill, the State is providing a defence for a company with a very dark past that was linked to Nazi Germany from the outset.  While I did not go into the detail of it, it is one of the war secrets yet to be fully detailed and discussed in public.  I will read out the text of a letter Gr&uuml;nenthal sent doctors.  <\/p><blockquote>Dear Doctors,<br \/><br \/>In pregnancy and during birth the female organism is under great stress.  Sleeplessness, unrest and tension are constant complaints.  The prescription of a sedative and hypnotic that will hurt neither the mother nor child is therefore often necessary.<\/blockquote><p>That was the cold spin that company sent Irish doctors.  That was the spin that T.P. Whelehan allowed to continue to roll around the Irish State for years after the withdrawal of the drug internationally.  That was the line that allowed the drug to remain within Irish hospitals over an extensive period.  That is what the Minister of State is defending.  That is the legacy that began post the birth of many of these children who had grave difficulties.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The Government failed to take account of the advice of the Attorney General at the time which resulted in damages not being quantified in the 1970s.  The Minister of State said this is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than the Minister for Health.  This is no more than Cabinet deflection and spin.  Has the Minister of State heard of the constitutional principle of collective Cabinet responsibility?  That principle was ignored in his address to the House this evening.  <br\/><br\/>I welcome the support of Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, O'Reilly and Connolly, all of whom spoke of the difficulties faced by victims over many years.  It is the case that previous Governments and Ministers failed victims and I am not afraid to say that.  The Bill gives the House an opportunity to give victims support and a chance to pursue their claims in court.  The Minister of State said that because of the importance of serving the public good, the principal Act grants extensions of time to limited cohorts who are described in the Act as being &quot;under a disability&quot;.  Does he not see the physical consequences for people who suffered as a result of thalidomide?  To have a Minister of State with responsibility for disability putting the words &quot;under a disability&quot; in quotation marks in his speech is quite insensitive.  Perhaps he did not write the speech but to even put that on paper and to question their entitlement, as people who have definite difficulties and disabilities as a result of what happened to them<i>in utero<\/i>50 years ago, is shameful and a poor reflection on the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State also said that it would run against the principle of protecting the common good to grant extensions of time to a cohort which does not meet the criteria for being granted such an extension.  Again, the Minister of State is questioning whether this should be granted on the basis of the disability criteria.  This reinforces the apparent alliance between the State Claims Agency and Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal before the High Court under case management.  The Minister of State went on to say that extensions of the limitation period apply to those with disabilities who need to be greatly impaired in their ability to take proceedings.  Is he aware that some of the people who took the <i>ex gratia<\/i>payment are now dead?  Does he realise that?  Some of the people who, on the night of the long knives in 2013, were forced to accept that payment have since died.  They were put under enormous pressure at that time which is why some of them accepted that payment.  For many of those involved, time is of the essence and resolving the ongoing case management is extremely important.  <br\/><br\/>The language in the Minister of State's speech is terribly inhumane and it shows that the State has learned nothing in the past 50 years.  Examples of what could occur were referenced but what we have here is the permanent government of today trying to defend permanent governments of the past.  This does not only rock the political system, but also the departmental system.  It rocks the Whitehall model we have in place here, which is based on mounting a defence, regardless of the consequences.  The Minister of State is supporting that approach when he could help these people.  I am confident that we will get this Bill passed and dispute the Government's contention in that regard.  An independent assessment will be made as to whether it requires a money message.  When the Government has to rely on the money message defence, it shows its inhumanity in dealing with people.  <br\/><br\/>Despite all of the spin about the HSE, the effect of the non-provision of services, including aids and appliances, has resulted in the exacerbation of difficulties and the deterioration of the physical health of many victims.  The Minister of State gave beautiful spin about all of the supports and wraparound services that these people enjoy.  Has he spoken to any of the victims of thalidomide?  Have they told him that they have the perfect system of supports, as outlined in his speech?  The opposite is actually the case.  Any independent assessment of the State's delivery of healthcare packages from the 1970s will find it lacking to a shameful degree, which continues to this day.  That is why court actions are ongoing.  <br\/><br\/>The State now has an opportunity to do the right thing by this cohort of its most vulnerable citizens.  To date, the Government has procrastinated, stood on ceremony and relied upon technicalities.  The Minister of State has promoted falsehoods and spin in his speech today.  The Government should not be trying to allow a company such as Chemie Gr&uuml;nenthal to gain unfair advantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>thalidomide survivors.  For this reason, it should reverse its decision, support this Bill and allow it to go through the Oireachtas so that the limited number of people involved can finally have their say and justice can prevail.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100051#YY00200","speaker":"1255","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1544564100,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Question put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1544564100,"counter":569,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 70(2), the division is postponed until the weekly division time on Thursday, 13 December 2018.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100052#ZZ00300","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2018 [Seanad]: Second Stage","time":1544564100,"counter":570,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100052#ZZ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1544564100,"counter":571,"content":"<p>I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"<\/p>  <p>  I am pleased to address the House on the Second Stage of the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill 2018.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad on 27 September 2018 and completed its passage through that House, without amendment, on 7 November 2018.  It is a short, technical Bill with only five sections.  It provides for the amendment of certain provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which relate to the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  Before explaining the Bill in more detail, I will provide the House with some background to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which this legislation seeks to amend and a brief update on its implementation to date.  The Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 17 designated health and social care professions.  Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council, HSCPC, with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland.  CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants.  <\/p>  <p>  The Act provides for a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners may register on the basis of specified qualifications.  Following this period, only registrants of a registration board, who are subject to the Act's regulatory regime, or those who applied during the transitional period and whose applications are still being determined or are under appeal are entitled to use the relevant protected title or titles.  From a public protection viewpoint, a crucial milestone in the regulation of the Act's designated professions was the commencement in recent years of Part 6 which introduced the Act's fitness to practise regime.  The regime is similar to that applicable to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.<\/p>  <p>  To date, registration boards have been established in respect of 13 professions.  The registers for nine of these professions are open and their respective professional titles are now fully protected under law following the close of the two-year transition period attaching to each register.  The registration boards for the professions of medical scientist, podiatrist, psychologist and social care worker, while established, have not yet opened their registers but are working hard to do so.<\/p>  <p>  I will also take this opportunity to update the House on the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists.  The Minister signed the regulations in April this year designating for the purpose of regulation the new professions of counsellor and psychotherapist and establishing the Counsellors and Psychotherapist Registration Board following the approval of the regulations by both Houses.  This was followed with an advertising campaign by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to recruit 13 members for appointment to the registration board.  This process concluded in late September 2018 and the Minister intends to make the board appointments in the coming weeks.  Once appointed, the registration board will give consideration to a number of outstanding issues and will advise the council and the Department accordingly.  These include titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners applying for registration in the transition period and for future graduates.<\/p><p>I am aware of other professions seeking designation under the Act.  Professions such as creative arts therapists, play therapists, athletic rehabilitation therapists, chiropractors and audiologists, to name but a few, have made a case for regulation for some time.  The immediate priority, however, is to bring to conclusion the regulatory process for the 17 professions already designated.<\/p> <p> When all the registration boards have been established and their work programmes are well under way, the Department will turn its attention to the question of how best to treat the unregulated professions.  As a first step, a risk assessment of public protection of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation will be undertaken in 2019.  It will inform decisions to be taken concerning options for their possible future regulation. <\/p> <p> In addition, the recently adopted EU directive on a proportionality test before the adoption of new regulation of professions must be taken into consideration.  The directive establishes rules for member states to conduct proportionality assessments before the introduction of new, or the amendment of existing, professional regulations to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market while guaranteeing transparency and a high level of consumer protection and public health.<\/p> <p> Its intention is that before member states introduce regulations on professions, they will harmonise the ways in which proportionality tests are carried out and the criteria to be applied in accordance with European Court of Justice rulings.  It does not, however, affect a member state's competence to decide whether and how to regulate a profession within the limits of non-discrimination and proportionality.  The directive must be transposed by July 2020.<\/p> <p> I propose to provide some background to the amendments contained within the Bill.  The Bill will amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide that all non-Irish professional qualifications which have been recognised by the Minister and by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for a health and social care profession will continue to be recognised for the purposes of registration under the Act.  This will allow holders of such qualifications to be statutorily registered and practise their professions.  <\/p> <p> As Deputies are aware, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory regulation for 17 health and social care professionals.  When statutory regulation is introduced for a profession, a practitioner cannot practise in his or her professional capacity without being registered with the relevant registration board established under the Act, one of the requirements for which is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification.  Section 38 provides that persons hold such a qualification if they hold an Irish qualification which has been approved by the relevant registration board, if they hold a European Economic Area, EEA, qualification which has been recognised under Directive 2005\/36\/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, if they have been practising the profession for not less than five years and hold certain Irish historical qualifications, or if they hold a professional qualification which the registration board decides attests to a standard of proficiency which corresponds to the approved relevant Irish qualification.<\/p> <p> As it stands, however, section 38 does not encompass EEA persons who have previously had their non-Irish qualifications recognised under a directive which has been subsequently repealed, non-EEA persons or persons with non-EEA qualifications whose qualifications have been recognised on an administrative basis using processes that mirror those of Directive 2005\/36\/EC or its predecessors.  A serious difficulty has arisen for these persons when they apply for registration.  While their qualifications may have been recognised in Ireland in the past, the legislation as currently framed does not allow for their registration.  This gap in the legislation must be resolved to allow such persons register and practise their professions.  The Bill addresses this gap by providing in section 38 that the qualification of an applicant who has evidence that such qualification has been recognised by the Minister or by a body acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for the relevant profession will be considered to be an approved qualification under the Act.  This means that there will be no requirement for reassessment of the qualification.<\/p> <p> The Bill has five sections.  Section 1 provides that the \"Principal Act\" referred to throughout is the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, while section 2 amends the definition of \"qualification\" in that Act.  Section 3 amends the registration provisions of the Act to address the gap that exists in the legislation by providing that a member of a relevant designated profession who holds a relevant professional qualification that has been recognised by a relevant person is considered to hold an \"approved qualification\".  Section 4 provides for the insertion of a Schedule to the Bill which sets out the list of relevant designated professions and corresponding relevant persons.  Finally, section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.<\/p> <p> In conclusion, this matter is a priority as without these amendments each registration board at CORU is required to undertake a detailed assessment of the professional qualifications of certain health and social care professionals whose qualifications have previously been recognised by the State.  Such persons must submit an application to CORU and await a decision, which can take a number of months as their formal training and post-qualification experience must be compared on a case-by-case basis against the current Irish reference standard.  This puts a consequential administrative burden on applicants and CORU.  For these reasons I am keen that the Bill proceeds through the various Stages of this House and is enacted as quickly as possible.  I commend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100052#ZZ00500","speaker":"1261","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544564700,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The Bill amends the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide that any non-Irish health professional qualification that was recognised in the State prior to the introduction of the statutory registration at the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, will not have to be re-recognised for the purposes of registration under the Act.  It pertains to a wide range of health and social care professions.  The 15 professions recognised under the Act are clinical biochemists, counsellors and psychotherapists, dieticians, dispensing opticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, optometrists, orthopists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, radiation therapists, social workers and speech and language therapists.  It is a valuable and important group of people for our medical and social care systems.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill provides a new route for non-Irish qualifications to be recognised and for the practitioners to be allowed, therefore, to use their professional titles.  If the foreign qualifications were recognised by the Minister or bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the creation of the new statutory registration regime, they will still be recognised without reassessment being required by CORU.  As such, those practitioners will be allowed use their professional titles.<\/p>  <p>  The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 was important legislation because it provided for quality control, registration and protection for the public in the context of this wide range of services.  Until that point, only doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists were subject to the statutory registration.  That was greatly expanded in 2005 and supported by the establishment of CORU, which also promotes standards of professional conduct, education, training, competence and more and, therefore, is an important body doing important work.  <\/p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il considers the amendment to the Act to be sensible and we will support the Bill in its passage.  While the Bill is largely technical in nature, as the Minister of State noted, new routes to professional recognition once deemed safe and appropriate are to be welcomed because we are running out of, or are desperately short of, many of the professionals referenced in the Bill.  <\/p>  <p>  The Bill covers radiographers.  A colleague of mine was contacted in his constituency in Kildare by general practitioners, GPs, who said they no longer had direct access to DEXA scanning.  It is an important bone-density scan for which GPs are able to make direct referral in many, although not all, hospitals.  We submitted a parliamentary question on the issue and I received a letter in return from the HSE through Naas General Hospital.  The letter acknowledged receipt of my letter and said the DEXA service to GPs is suspended due to a national shortage of radiographers.  It went on to say the hospital is making every effort to fill the current vacancies.  Hospitals and radiographers, as well as the consultants, doctors and nurses who work with those radiographers, will say the same thing, namely, that they cannot hire the staff.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the things we need to do is open the diagnostic suites more because there is a massive backlog of people waiting for diagnostics.  We have the machines, and in some other countries the diagnostic suites are open 24-7, or from 6 a.m. until 12 midnight six days a week.  Typically, we do not that do that, and our hospitals are open from approximately 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, although it varies somewhat.  When one talks to the hospital managers and asks them why they are not doing more diagnostics, they do not say they do not have the machines or that they cannot bring patients into the hospital.  When one talks to patients who say they have been waiting months for what could be very important scans, and when one asks if they would mind presenting at the hospital on a Saturday or Sunday, or at 7 a.m. or 9 p.m., they will reply of course they would not mind as they need the scan.  All the hospitals, nurses and doctors will tell one they cannot hire the radiographers, which is a serious matter.<\/p>  <p>  On children with special needs, the reference to occupational therapists and speech and language therapists is worth reflecting on.  I looked at the waiting lists in preparation for this session.  Although men and women are also waiting for speech and language therapy, a significant number of those waiting are children.<\/p><p>There are many adults as well with an acquired brain injury, stroke and all sorts of conditions.  Many of the people awaiting speech and language therapy in the Minister of State's constituency and mine are children.  The number of patients, men women and children, in the country waiting for initial assessment from a speech and language therapist is 14,501.  In the Kildare-Wicklow area there are more than 800.<\/p> <p> Occupational therapy and occupational therapists, OTs, are used for the rehabilitation of a wide range of chronic conditions and all sorts of other conditions.  Many of the people who use them have spinal injuries.  Many children, including children with special needs, are waiting for occupational therapy.  I took a look at these figures as well.  The total number of people in Ireland right now waiting for an initial assessment from an occupational therapist is 32,102.  In the Kildare-Wicklow area again, it is in excess of 2,800 people.<\/p> <p> On the issue of physiotherapists, there is a chronic shortage of rehabilitation facilities.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital does its very best.  It is a phenomenal place with phenomenal people but they are screaming out for more beds and proper step-down facilities.  I was very involved with one case involving a very unfortunate event that happened where a fit, healthy young man working out in a gym on the west coast had an accident in the gym.  When he woke up on the floor of the gym, his spine was fractured and he was quadriplegic.  Unless medicine evolves very quickly, that is the prognosis.  He received fantastic care in the National Rehabilitation Hospital.  From memory, he was discharged in September of last year with other people with serious injuries very much in need of his bed.  In fairness, the HSE, after taking a long time to get going, finally did row in behind us and we managed to get Andrew O'Malley his bed around May.  He was sitting in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, taking up a bed that somebody else needed, and was unable to go to a step-down facility.<\/p> <p> When one talks to those in charge of disability services, those in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, or those running the step-down facilities, they will say that they do not have enough physiotherapists.  This Bill is relevant because it is a small step in making it easier for qualified physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and a wide range of very important people in our system by removing one barrier to them being able to do their job.  The chronic shortage of these professionals, be they speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, radiographers or physiotherapists - the list goes on and on - is causing untold pain and suffering.  In many cases it is depriving people, especially children with special needs where there has to be as much early intervention as possible and it is taking three and a half years for them even to begin treatment, of leading the best future life that they can live.  It is not exactly what the Bill is about, but it is about these professionals in our country.  We need to do a hell of a lot more to keep them, reward them, and understand how to make their jobs better and more rewarding and make sure that they have the staffing ratios, pay and conditions, professional learning environments and training they need so that we can keep the fantastic professionals we train and so that we can become a place of choice of employment for these professionals from all over the world.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100053#AAA00200","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544565300,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting this Bill.  It is technical in nature and it is not the most glamorous legislation but it is very important nonetheless, providing as it does the amendment of certain provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 relating to the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications.<\/p>  <p>  There have been many Bills seeking to amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 over recent months, and important changes have been made to that legislation regarding physical therapists and physiotherapists.  The Minister of State outlined for us here the work done to date on bringing in counsellors and psychotherapists.  This is an issue that I have discussed with Minister, Deputy Harris, on a number of occasions and one that has been well rehearsed in the media.  It has relevance to the legislation we were discussing last week in that until there is regulation of what are commonly known as rogue crisis pregnancy agencies, we will still have people purporting to call themselves counsellors, experts and every other thing and telling women who access terminations that abortion can lead to cancer.  That needs to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the work that has been done to date, as outlined by the Minister of State.  I assure him of the support of Sinn F&eacute;in in anything that he does to bring some regulation into this area.  In a couple of weeks, the hope rather than the expectation is that the heat will go out of the issue of discussing abortion.  We have been discussing it for a long time.  This is one of the loopholes that need to be closed.  There are other things relating to sex education in schools and so on.  This is a very important one.  I very much welcome the work done to date and commit my party to working with the Minister of State to ensure that regulation is brought in.<\/p>  <p>  The core legislation that we are amending is important.  The Act provides for the statutory regulation of 17 designated health and social care professions by way of statutory protection of professional titles, confining their use solely to the persons granted that registration.  The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure dealing with disciplinary matters, and a health and social care professionals council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system.  These bodies, collectively known as CORU, are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in this State.  CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct, and education, training and competence among the registrants.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill is short and technical and provides for all non-Irish professional qualifications which have been recognised by the Minister and by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of the statutory regulation of health and social care professionals to continue to be recognised for the purposes of registration under this Act.  This will allow holders of this qualification to be registered statutorily and to practise their professions.  The existing legislation does not allow for the registration of non-EU persons or persons with non-EEA qualifications whose qualifications have previously been recognised here.  There is a gap to that extent in the current legislation and the Bill rectifies that.  It is important that we tie up these loose ends because the social care professionals who are affected need security so that they can register and patients also need security in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The regulatory bodies that we have in the health area comprise CORU, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, and the Medical Council.  For various reasons, I am aware of the functions of all of those boards, as no doubt is the Minister of State.  For a brief period I represented some of the workers in An Bord Altranais.  I know the work that goes on among them in terms of research, regulation, and educational support and provision.  Among the health professionals who pay a fee every year to be registered, however, there are those who often feel aggrieved.  If the Minister of State checks social media tonight, he will see a particular group feature.  That is not the reason I raised the issue as it was in my head to raise it anyway.  Such people feel there is a very heavy emphasis on regulation, fitness to practise inquiries and the punitive aspects rather than on support.  We could talk all day about these matters and I know the Minister of State will profoundly disagree with me, but I believe the Government and previous Governments have made sure that the health service is a very unattractive place for health and social care professionals to work in.<\/p><p>That is not helped by the atmosphere that can be created by paying every month or paying every year into an organisation for which one sees no real benefit.  I do not say there is not a benefit because I know that there is.  I know that the men and women who work for those boards work hard and they do a lot of good work, but very often that is not seen by the professionals who are subject to the board.  What people see on the news is the hearings.  We could discuss all day whether the hearings should be in public or private, but they are in public.  People see their colleagues on the news being brought before their professional body and it is tough on them.  I remember every single case I ever took to An Bord Altranais because of the significant toll they took on the individuals concerned.  Many colleagues of those individuals were asked to give evidence and the business is conducted with the authority of a court and it is a very formal environment for people who work hard to have to face.  Errors can happen because of a shortage of staff.  It is not the fault of the people who turn up to work.  They are the ones that are there, and it is the fault of the HSE and the Government that the health service is not an attractive place to work.  Where there is short staffing and errors occur, people are constantly worried and then they get to pay for the privilege of having a body to regulate them.<\/p> <p> Regulation is extremely important and I back it, but in discussing the regulatory bodies it would be remiss of me not to say that notwithstanding the good work they do, they are not viewed as an ally or an asset by many healthcare professionals.  They are viewed as a sort of big brother because the good work they do is rarely seen but the public trials and fitness-to-practise hearings are always visible, and the reputation and public perception of the bodies is based on that.<\/p> <p> Some years ago, An Bord Altranais put up the fees for the registration of nurses and there was a campaign by the trade union to have the decision reversed.  In every workplace I went to people asked me why they were paying An Bord Altranais.  They said their workplace was short-staffed and if there was an error, they would have to go to the board they pay for to account for things that are not necessarily their fault.  People make complaints when errors happen, which they do for a variety of reasons, but nurse after nurse and midwife after midwife have come to me to ask why they are paying for that.  They said they are working hard to earn their money, to pay money to those people who are going to regulate them, and they could find themselves accounting for something that genuinely might not be their fault and could be due to a systems error, short-staffing or any one of a number of reasons.<\/p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation.  We are actively looking forward to the legislation regulating counsellors and psychotherapists but I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to do more to promote the good work that is done by the regulatory bodies or even to have a discussion with them to bring home to them the reality of how they are viewed in their own communities because that is not always evident.  There should not be an adversarial relationship between the healthcare professional and his or her regulatory body because there is an element of support and education available and that is very often not seen by many of the people who are regulated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100054#BBB00200","speaker":"1302","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544565900,"counter":577,"content":"<p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Bill this evening.  It will provide for the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications which have been recognised by the Minister and State bodies prior to the introduction of statutory registration for health and social care professionals.  They will continue to be recognised for the purpose of registration under the Act.  In layman's terms, the Bill will allow holders of non-Irish professional qualifications to be registered and to be able to practise their professions here in Ireland.  The existing legislation does not allow for the registration of non-EU persons or persons with non-EEA qualifications whose qualifications had previously been recognised in Ireland.  Currently, we have a shortage of healthcare professionals and the Bill could help relieve the problem.  I have repeatedly called on the Government to act to reduce the long waiting lists that exist, but it is not listening.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have taken 18 buses to Belfast and the 19th is travelling next week to allow people to avail of a 15 minute cataract procedure.  Otherwise, they would be expected to wait for up to four years for such treatment on the public waiting list.  I had a constituent in his 90s who was expected to wait four years for a cataract procedure.  He was slowly getting more blind each year and I dread to think would have happened if he was still waiting on the Government to provide a cataract procedure for him.<\/p>  <p>  On many occasions in this Chamber I suggested that Bantry General Hospital or Mallow General Hospital could be utilised for cataract procedures as that would go a long way to reducing waiting lists.  In Belfast the hospitals operate a weekend model where procedures such as cataracts, hips, knees and every other imaginable operation can take place on Saturdays and Sundays.  Why can we not have a similar system here?  Why do most hospitals shut down in Ireland at 5 p.m. on a Friday evening and real healthcare only resumes on Monday morning?  We cannot continue to do that if we are to tackle waiting lists and help people who are suffering while waiting for procedures to be carried out.  It is a joke.  We know that many operating theatres, especially in rural hospitals, are not operating at full capacity.  Some of them only operate two to three days a week.  I have been told that it is due to staffing levels.  No wonder our waiting lists are at an extremely critical point in this country.<\/p>  <p>  I met the management of Bantry General Hospital as recently as last month to put forward the suggestion that the hospital could provide cataract procedures.  I keep hearing the argument that the hospital does not have enough staff or facilities for such procedures in rural hospitals.  Therefore, the sooner this Bill is amended, the sooner appropriately qualified healthcare professionals can register with the registration board and practise their professions.  It is important that happens across the health sector.<\/p>  <p>  I do not shy away from the fact that this is an important Bill.  It is vital that we have proper regulations and that there is proper accountability.  That goes without saying.  We also need to address the fact that we have an influx of returning emigrants.  I welcome them home, but I want to address the issues they face.  For them to continue in their profession they must establish that while they were abroad they gained a certain degree of professional experience.  Currently, there is undue delay in dealing with them.  A board meeting must be held to establish their level of experience among other things.  It is an inefficient system to have a board meeting.   We should consider a board having a designated officer who would operate in accordance with the established criteria of the board.  Such an officer would be a professional who would understand the board's objectives and criteria, and who could adjudicate on individual applicants, thus speeding up the process for returning emigrants who want to work in the medical profession.  We must examine such matters as we need to encourage nurses, health and social care professionals to return to Ireland.  How are we encouraging such healthcare professionals to return home when they are left in limbo on returning home?  We know there are health professionals who have returned home who have been left waiting months for their registration.  That is unacceptable.  Those people on returning home cannot immediately work in their profession because of the delay in processing their registration and they have to resort to taking up part-time, unskilled work.  That is an appalling way to treat our healthcare professionals.<\/p>  <p>  Returning emigrants from Australia, the US and England not only have to face the difficulty of applying for their professional registration, they also have the difficulty of sorting out their banking, insurance cover and driving licence.  All those are major issues for our emigrants returning home.  Why are we making it so hard to welcome people home and get them back into their old employment to do what they have been trained for down through the years?  We should welcome them with open arms.  <\/p>  <p>  I will be a little parochial, but this is an important and valid point.  Presumably the same situation is found in other places.  There are two consultant posts in Bantry General Hospital which have not been filled because the hospital cannot get consultants.  Why is that?  I firmly belief proper incentives are not being given to attract consultants to take up those positions in the hospital.<\/p><p>The Minister of State knows the importance of Bantry General Hospital to over 84,000 people in west Cork and much of Kerry.  The Minister for Health was there recently, making announcements.  He can be making announcements until the cows come home but if the consultants are not there to carry out the work, there is no point making any announcement.  In the case of Bantry General Hospital, we have to put in the foundation before we start talking about all the other things that need to be done there.  In my view, the foundation is the consultants.  The HSE has failed to provide incentives that would bring consultants to the hospital.  It has left it in a situation where the two consultants that are required have not been attracted and the posts have had to be advertised again.  Are there incentives this time to attract consultants?  If not, we are back to square one.  As the Minister of State knows, management is doing an excellent job in Bantry General Hospital but we need the HSE to wake up.<\/p> <p> We have a five-day hospital when we should have a seven-day hospital.  Many people are suffering.  I know of a young mother in west Cork who urgently needed an MRI scan at the weekend because she was suffering serious pain but she could not get it.  That is outrageous and very unfair, and issues like this have to be tackled.  We seem not to understand the system that is needed.  It is sad that I have to go to the North of Ireland to see how the system works.  If the Minister of State walks into Kingsbridge hospital in Belfast, he will see how it works, and he is welcome to come with me sometime.  It is flat out there on Saturdays and Sundays.  People are cared for, no matter what their situation or their ailments, seven days a week, non-stop.  That is the system we need to build.  We have a second class healthcare system at the moment and it will stay second class until we tackle those issues.  I will support the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018121100055#CCC00200","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1544566500,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for their constructive contributions to the Second Stage debate and their support for the Bill overall.
