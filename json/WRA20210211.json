Its function is to add certainty to businesses that funding is available for working capital and investment purposes. Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to five and a half years at reduced interest rates.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees. The Scheme is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers. <\/p>  <p>  While the State provides a guarantee on these loans, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans offered under the Scheme, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders. There are clear eligibility criteria set out in the lending terms, including a minimum impact of 15 percent on turnover as a result of COVID-19 and a return to viability in the future. These features were set by the European Commission in their State Aid Temporary Framework. The CCGS must operate in accordance with this Framework. Private finance providers have the widest network and closest relationship with Irish businesses to make these assessments.   <\/p>  <p>  Where an applicant has had a loan application refused, they may wish to appeal the decision to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks.

Since January, 19 Credit Unions and 3 non-bank lenders have successfully joined the CCGS as finance providers. More are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. This long-term policy goal of diversification will add competition in the market and ensure a wide range of loan products being available. I encourage businesses to check out the CCGS pages on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland&rsquo;s website for a full list of participating finance providers.<\/p>  <p>  I want to assure the Deputy that I and my officials are monitoring the Scheme and its effectiveness.

The complexity and interconnectedness of the SDGs requires continued and regular cross-government engagement to support effective and coherent implementation. To this end, a priority in developing the first SDG National Implementation Plan was establishing an effective governance structure that would oversee delivery of the 2030 Agenda from a whole-of-government perspective.\u00a0 A Senior Officials&rsquo; Group on the SDGs was established, and is assisted by an SDG Interdepartmental Working Group, with both groups comprising representatives from all Government Departments. Ten meetings of the Interdepartmental Working Group have taken place to date, with six meetings in 2019 and four further meetings in 2020. Further details are set out in the table below. <\/p><p>An important element of the first Plan is the SDG Policy Map and SDG Matrix. The SDG Matrix details the lead and stakeholder Department for each of the SDGs and 169 targets. The SDG Policy Map identifies national sectoral policies against the 17 Goals and 169 related targets. Both are\u00a0available as Annexes to the Plan at:<\/p><p>.<\/p><p>The SDG Policy Map enhances the ability of stakeholders to track Ireland&rsquo;s implementation of specific SDGs and associated targets, and to assess Ireland&rsquo;s response to the SDGs for potential policy gaps. It also supports and enhances cross-Government engagement in implementing each of the Goals and targets.<\/p><p>Ensuring and improving policy coherence across the Goals is a critical feature and area for consideration in \u00a0developing \u00a0a revision of the National Implementation Plan. The SDG Policy Map is currently being revised and enhanced to facilitate further engagement and coherency. As part of this process, the lead and stakeholder Departments for each of the Goals and targets is also being reviewed. The enhanced SDG Policy Map will be a key feature of the new Plan. <\/p><p>A roadmap and timeline for completion of the new Plan is currently being finalised, with publication envisaged later this year. The SDG Stakeholder Forum will remain an important feature in the development of, and implementation of the next Plan. \u00a0Scheduling of the next Stakeholder Forum meeting will be informed by the finalised roadmap.  <table>    <tr>       <th>IDWG Meeting<\/th>       <th>SDG Implementation Plan Actions\u00a0Discussed <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10\/01\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot; SDG Stakeholder Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;Communications Strategy <br \/><br \/>&middot; SDG Champions <br \/><br \/>&middot; CSO Geohive SDG Platform<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>08\/04\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot; SDG Stakeholder Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot; National SDG Champions <br \/><br \/>&middot; UN High Level Political Forum in July and Head Of State SDG Summit <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Communications Protocol <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>19\/06\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;Communications Protocol <br \/><br \/>&middot;UN HLPF <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Stakeholder \u00a0Forum <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>16\/08\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;SDG Stakeholder \u00a0Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Champions <br \/><br \/>&middot;Communications Protocol <br \/><br \/>&middot;UN Head of State SDG Summit<br \/><br \/>&middot;CSO Geohive SDG Platform<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>10\/10\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;SDG Stakeholder Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;Next National Implementation Plan<br \/><br \/>&middot;Review of Actions <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Champions <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Working Groups <br \/><br \/>&middot;Policy Coherence <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>11\/12\/2019<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;SDG Stakeholder Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;Senior Officials Group<br \/><br \/>&middot;Next National Implementation Plan<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>13\/01\/2020<br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;National Implementation Plan 2020 <br \/><br \/>&middot;UN High-Level Political Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;Stakeholder\u00a0 Forum <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>16\/06\/2020 <br \/><br \/><\/td>       <td>&middot;UN High-Level Political Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Stakeholder\u00a0 Forum 2020\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Champions Programme <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>23\/07\/2020<\/td>       <td>&middot;UN High-Level Political Forum <br \/><br \/>&middot;Stakeholder\u00a0 Forum 2020\u00a0 <br \/><br \/>&middot;SDG Champions Programme <br \/><br \/>&middot;Statements of Strategies &ndash; including SDGs<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>03\/09\/2020 <\/td>       <td>&middot;National Implementation Plan &ndash; Next steps<br \/><br \/>&middot;\u00a0SDG Stakeholder\u00a0 Forum 2020\u00a0 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting","counter":22,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB00900"},{"type":"question","counter":23,"qnumday":8,"qnumall":"[7605\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB01000","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the status of the national clean air Strategy; if this strategy will contain a ban on the cutting, selling or burning of turf for domestic heating purposes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":24,"qnumday":9,"qnumall":"[7606\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB01100","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the fact that many households, particularly in rural Ireland, still depend on burning turf as a heating source for their homes; if the cutting or burning of turf will not be prevented for domestic heating purposes in the absence of the State providing alternatives for these households; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":25,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently working to finalise Ireland&rsquo;s first National Clean Air Strategy which I intend to publish in the coming months.

However, the provision of additional data from our enhanced National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Programme and Environmental Protection Agency funded research projects also indicates the extent to which solid fuels, such as peat and wet wood, contribute to localised high levels of particulate matter and other pollutants during the heating season. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is, therefore, appropriate that we consider a new approach to the broader regulation of all solid fuels, expanding our ambition with the objective of achieving greater reductions in air pollution levels. <\/p>  <p>  The next step in this process will be a public consultation which will seek views in relation to the national application of the regulations currently applied to bituminous coal, as well as informing the development of appropriate regulatory controls for other residential solid fuels.

The review is considering impacts arising from the formation of a new Government, the outcome of Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and represents an opportunity to revise and update cost estimates. <\/p>  <p>  Work is currently underway on phase 1 to form part of the evidence base for the revised NDP and which is addressing the key impact of sectoral strategies. For transport, a key input here is our revised sectoral strategy for investment, which is nearing completion and will replace the 2016 Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport (SFILT). This is intended to ensure that investment in transport is aligned with and supports overarching Government policy, including the spatial strategy for the coming decades - as established by the National Planning Framework and articulated by the 10 National Strategic Outcomes - and our increased national ambition around combatting climate change as committed to in the Programme for Government. <\/p>  <p>  The draft investment framework sets four priorities for future transport investment, and projects will need to align with one or more of these priorities if they are to be considered for funding. These priorities are: (1) Decarbonisation; (2) Protection and Renewal; (3) Mobility of People and Goods in Urban Areas; and, (4) Enhanced Regional and Rural Connectivity.  Furthermore, the proposed investment framework establishes modal and intervention hierarchies to guide investment;  these hierarchies seek to ensure that project sponsors deploy the most environmentally sustainable solution to a given transport issue and that investment is proportional to the issue at hand.  Where projects under consideration propose solutions that are ostensibly less aligned with these hierarchies, they must demonstrate that solutions from further up the hierarchies are unsuitable or not feasible. <\/p>  <p>  I have approved the draft investment framework for public consultation.  The framework is sufficiently advanced that my Department and its agencies are applying the investment priorities and hierarchies to support and inform our consideration and prioritisation of investment as part of the NDP Review.

Last summer guidance issued to all local authorities in relation to improving the allocation of road-space in urban centres &ndash; be they villages, towns or cities &ndash; as part of the response to the COVID-19 but also seeking to ensure a multi-disciplinary approach to street design and the promotion of the principles of universal design. <\/p><p>That guidance was in turn supported by financial supports made available by my Department to local authorities under Government&rsquo;s July Stimulus and the benefits of schemes rolled out under that Stimulus can already be seen in many areas across the country. <\/p><p>As part of Budget 2021 significant additional financial supports have been made available to support active travel and as part of those supports a new Active Travel Fund was announced toward the end of last year. This funding is being used to develop a new stream of funding support for those local authorities outside of the main cities and the announcement stipulated the type of projects envisaged under the Fund, and included the development of active travel strategies in areas where none exist, as well as other potential projects for actual construction. <\/p><p>Finally, another important strand of this overall commitment was the announcement a few weeks ago in relation to establishing and resourcing active travel teams in local authorities across the country. The Deputies will, I am sure, acknowledge that the lack of sufficient resources within local authorities to oversee and deliver the design and roll-out of new infrastructure has been a real constraint in recent years, so I was particularly pleased to see progress made on this front. <\/p><p>As the Deputies can see from the above, there are a range of complementary measures underway which collectively will ensure that Government&rsquo;s ambition in this area of active travel is realised in the years ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus &Eacute;ireann","counter":63,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB04800"},{"type":"question","counter":64,"qnumday":22,"qnumall":"[7467\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB04900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if he has engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann following its decision to end discounted travel rates for passengers with epilepsy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":65,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[7468\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100047#WRB05000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the reason for the decision by Bus &Eacute;ireann to end discounted travel rates for passengers with epilepsy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":66,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.<\/p><p>As Minister for Transport I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

Some planned National Vehicle Driver File business service enhancements were not undertaken as priorities were reframed to address pandemic related issues. This accordingly delayed the RTOL IT upgrade.<\/p><p><b>B6 &ndash; <\/b>Due to the impact of COVID-19, there were delays to the asps Grant Scheme and LEVTI Scheme; on vehicle sales and motorway traffic; delays in modelling work undertaken; delays in the Purchase and delivery of Hydrogen buses; and delays in the establishment of the Alternatively Fuelled HDV Purchase Grant Scheme.<\/p><p><b>B7.2<\/b>- Progress was delayed on one of the Rural Transport \/ Local Link projects, managed by the National Transport Authority due to the impacts of COVID-19.<\/p><p><b>B8.1 &ndash; <\/b>A delay in cross-border greenway projects.<\/p><p><b>B8.2 -<\/b>Delays to various rail projects, including the delivery of 41 rail cars.<\/p><p><b>B8.3<\/b>&ndash; There were delivery delays on 2020 Bus Fleet which will now arrive in 2021.<\/p><p><b>B8.5 &ndash;<\/b>The delay is due to the timing of &ldquo;July Stimulus&rdquo; funding. The reason for the underspend has been the volume of work to be completed in a very short time frame, and the need to undertake both tendering and construction in the limited period since funding was confirmed. Multiple local authorities were tendering for the same type of work concurrently, the availability of suitable contracting resources has also proved to be a constraint on certain projects.<\/p><p><b>B8.6 -<\/b>There have been significant delays in projects drawing down expenditure due to COVID-19 impacts.<\/p><p><b>C3 &ndash;<\/b>There were delays on the IRCG Building Programme and COVID-19 related delays on the procurement of Coast Guard boats.<\/p><p>As can be seen, the Covid-19 impact is the primary reason for delays experienced. Construction delays, manufacturing delays and supply chain delays have all been contributory factors. It is hoped that impacts in 2021 will be less significant that in 2020 as multiple structures are now in place nationally to offset the impacts of the pandemic and minimise disruption. However, the risk of disruption still exists. <\/p><p>An additional reason for delays relates to the timing of the 2020 &ldquo;July Stimulus&rdquo; package. My Department directed capital expenditure towards &ldquo;shovel-ready&rdquo; projects. However, even with &ldquo;shovel ready&rdquo; projects, there is still a period required to plan and design the projects that have been approved. The result is a small lag time between funding becoming available and being invested. As a result, it was necessary to carry some of the July Stimulus capital into 2021 to allow adequate time for project design and implementation.<\/p><p>Ongoing monitoring and early identification of emerging concerns will be instrumental in identifying any underspend and related root cause. In 2021, my Department will be reporting in detail on a quarterly basis to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the progress of investment of the 2021 budget. This additional reporting is partly intended to identify emerging underspends. This quarterly reporting will take place alongside standard monthly reports. Reasons for any emerging underspends will be identified and addressed on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100048#WRC04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":117,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100048#WRC04500"},{"type":"question","counter":118,"qnumday":41,"qnumall":"[7762\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100048#WRC04600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of driver theory tests during level 5 lockdown; if extra appointments are planned due to the backlog; the number waiting by county; the length of time they have been waiting in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":119,"content":"<p>Details on the waiting time for a Driver Theory Test are held by the Road Safety Authority.

Therefore they may not be used on public roads and in public places.  However, their use is permitted on private land with the permission of the landowner.  While their use on public roads (including footways) is clearly illegal, I am aware that there has been some confusion on this matter and that commercial interests have not always highlighted the legal constraints on their use.<\/p>  <p>  The intention is to legislate for e-scooters in accordance with the Programme for Government as soon as possible. This involves identifying and developing appropriate amendments to primary legislation across a range of complex areas. The work must be carried out in such a way that it does not undermine the overall framework of Road Traffic Law or Road Safety in general. Department officials are currently working on drafting the necessary changes to primary legislation. Subject to satisfactory resolution of the necessary issues, Minister Ryan intends to bring forward amendments to the enabling primary legislation when the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the Oireachtas as soon as possible. <\/p>  <p>  Experience overseas has shown that a change of regime may have consequences for road safety, the management of roads and footpaths, the movement of traffic, public transport and goods, public health and the environment. These are all factors which must be taken into consideration when legislating. <\/p>  <p>  Until new legislation is in place, the use of electric scooters will remain illegal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100049#WRD00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":139,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100049#WRD00800"},{"type":"question","counter":140,"qnumday":48,"qnumall":"[7835\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100049#WRD00900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if there is a delay in the processing of driver licence renewals for both full and provisional licence holders; the average delay; the steps being taken to address a backlog, given the problems it is causing for persons waiting for their new licences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1576","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":141,"content":"<p>All enquires relating to driver licensing are handled by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), provided by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, thus far, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions have had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged. Stay and Spend is scheduled to operate until 30 April but the flexibility exists for me to extend its operation in 2021 beyond that date (to end 2021).  It is too early as yet to take definitive decisions in that regard.  Much will depend on how circumstances unfold in the months ahead.

There is no alternative to the implementation of these formalities and controls because they are an essential part of maintaining the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union, a vital consideration in the ability and entitlement of goods coming from Ireland to move freely within the European Union.<\/p>  <p>  In preparation for the changes brought about by the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU, I am advised that Revenue carried out significant work to increase their IT systems&rsquo; capacity to cater for the increased level of trade with what is now a 3rd country and the consequent significantly increased volume of  declarations. <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2021, I am advised that Revenue has been monitoring activity levels within their systems. They identified degradation in performance during times of peak processing resulting in delayed responses to declarations and other messages lodged by trade. One of the contributing factors for this is the growth in the business levels of large filers with lots of small consignments, a business model that has increased significantly with the move to online shopping since the start of the pandemic.  <\/p>  <p>  I know that Revenue acknowledges that a delay in processing creates difficulties for trade and business and that Revenue has apologised for the difficulties which have been caused for trade and business. I am advised that Revenue is working with its software provider to increase capacity at peak processing times. At the same time Revenue is working with large filers, to develop tailored solutions that will facilitate their business model and ensure that other goods traffic is not adversely impacted by peak load processing delays. I am informed by Revenue that this approach is working well and that processing delays at peak times have been reduced and that Revenue is continuing to focus on further improvements in the performance of its import system.<\/p>  <p>  I understand from Revenue that businesses can pre-lodge their customs declarations up to 30 days in advance. This facilitates those who are in possession of all necessary information to file their declarations well in advance of the arrival of their goods ensuring they will be unaffected by peak load processing.

The incentive gives a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation.  Section 477C of the Taxes Consolidation Act outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the Help to Buy scheme.<\/p>  <p>  One such condition is that a qualifying first time buyer must take out a loan in an amount equal to at least 70% of either the purchase price of the property in the case of a purchased house, or the value of the property in the case of a self-build house.  The valuation of a self-build is as approved by the lender as determined in accordance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s macro prudential rules.  These rules stipulate the valuation as being the site cost plus the cost of construction.<\/p>  <p>  I appreciate the particular circumstances regarding the case detailed by the Deputy. However, the rationale behind the 70% LTV condition is that those who require a mortgage below this level are generally considered to have sufficient resources to more than meet the deposit requirements of the macro-prudential rules and thus less in need of assistance from the Exchequer. Lowering the ceiling could only increase deadweight in the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  While any changes to the scheme are matters for consideration in the context of the annual Budget and Finance Bill, I have no plans at the moment to review the LTV conditions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Legislative Reviews","counter":210,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":211,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[7845\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 is achieving the objective intended by the legislation to provide greater protection to consumers whose loans were transferred on to credit-servicing firms.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":212,"qnumday":78,"qnumall":"[7846\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the definition of \"owner of credit\" in the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 needs to be amended in order to ensure that it covers entities that retain the beneficial ownership of the credit but who have transferred legal ownership to another entity.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":213,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[7847\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on whether the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 requires further amendment to ensure that the beneficial owners of credit are regulated.","asker":"1553","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":214,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 to 79, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015, credit servicing firms have been subject to the provisions of Irish financial services law that apply to regulated financial services providers, including but not limited to: <\/p>  <p>  - The Consumer Protection Code<\/p>  <p>  - the CCMA <\/p>  <p>  - the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015, <\/p>  <p>  - the Fitness and Probity Regime, <\/p>  <p>  - the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48(1)) Minimum Competency Regulations 2017, and <\/p>  <p>  - the Minimum Competency Code 2017<\/p>  <p>  The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 (the 2018 Act) expanded the scope of &lsquo;credit servicing&rsquo; to also bring the loan owners themselves directly under Central Bank regulation and supervision, and also within the scope of the relevant consumer protection framework. The 2018 Act came into effect on 21 January 2019 and expanded the definition of &lsquo;credit servicing&rsquo; in the 2015 Act to also include the following activities:<\/p>  <p>  - holding the legal title to credit granted under the credit agreement;<\/p>  <p>  - determination of the overall strategy for the management and administration of a portfolio of credit agreements; and<\/p>  <p>  - maintenance of control over key decisions relating to such portfolio.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank published Authorisation Requirements and Standards (the Standards) in December 2015. These Standards require that Credit Servicing Firms must be able to demonstrate that they are in a position to conduct their affairs in a manner that ensures the best interests of their customers are protected. The Standards were imposed on Credit Servicing Firms as a condition of authorisation and must be complied with on an ongoing basis. <\/p>  <p>  In advance of the 2018 legislation coming into effect on 21 January 2019, the Central Bank published and updated the Standards to reflect the fact that loan owners now fall to be directly regulated. The Standards provide that a Credit Servicing Firms must structure, organise and resource its business to ensure that it is in a position to demonstrate that it can comply with applicable regulatory requirements. This includes ensuring that adequate and effective control of the firm rests in the State, that all firm records are available to the Central Bank, and that the firm is not outsourcing activities to any extent that would impact on its ability to meet all applicable regulatory requirements. <\/p>  <p>  The Standards also contain additional requirements for Credit Servicing Firms which hold the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement and which engage in associated ownership activities. These requirements include that each Credit Servicing Firms must have effective processes for the development, implementation and oversight of the firm&rsquo;s overall strategy for the management and administration of its portfolios of credit agreements and the maintenance of control over key decisions relating to those portfolios. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision strategy for the credit-servicing sector has a number of elements, including: <\/p>  <p>  - Detailed data gathering and analysis, including mortgage arrears and repossession data, such as the pattern of arrears in the Irish mortgage market by entity type; mortgage arrears profile; restructuring activity in the Irish market; data on ARAs and complaints etc. Additionally, obtaining direct evidence from consumers to provide first-hand information about their experiences in dealing with the credit-servicing sector. <\/p>  <p>  - Intensified risk and evidenced-based supervision, which includes both on-site and offsite inspections. The Central Bank will continue to assertively supervise credit servicing firms&rsquo; compliance with the CCMA, to ensure that a fair and transparent process is in place for all borrowers, including those whose loans have been sold. <\/p>  <p>  - Use of its full suite of supervisory powers as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s approach to supervision of the credit-servicing sector is underpinned by an expectation of high standards and a professional and consumer-focused approach to compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Beneficial owners were excluded from the scope of the 2018 Act as their inclusion could have had an impact on entities like passive securitisation vehicles. Irish and European banks use securitisation as a matter of course to raise funds for on-lending to the real economy, mortgage borrowers and SMEs who need access to credit. This is an important and ongoing aspect of the international financial system and passive securitisation vehicles do not have any implications for consumer protection.<\/p>  <p>  If securitisation vehicles needed to be authorised and regulated, a number of unintended consequences may arise. For example, such vehicles could find it impossible to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank and therefore could be forced out of the market completely. Alternatively, they would have to take on staff and premises and adopt structures in order to meet these requirements and the costs of this would be factored in the price that buyers would be willing to pay for securitisations thereby increasing costs which are likely to be passed to consumer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":216,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":215,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03600"},{"type":"question","counter":216,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[7545\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100050#WRE03700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the reason civil and public servants cannot avail of the working-from-home allowance of &euro;3.20 per week.","asker":"1491","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":217,"content":"<p>During this exceptional time, whereby a significant number of public servants are required to work from home, in line with public health advice, my Department has published central guidance on working arrangements during COVID-19 for the Civil and Public Service.

This meant that for eligible businesses, such as those in the hospitality sector, their commercial rates were funded by Government for nine months of 2020.  This was an unprecedented measure, which offered support to businesses and financial certainty to local authorities.  As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of the remaining three months of commercial rates for 2020, is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal collection procedures.  In practice, it is understood that most local authorities promote the use of direct debit payment facilities and work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options that reflect capacity to pay.  Any business with concerns in that regard may wish to engage directly with the rates department of the relevant local authority.<\/p>  <p>  In order to continue supporting businesses and other ratepayers, and in recognition of the ongoing impacts of  COVID 19 and the associated public health restrictions, the Government recently announced that a more targeted commercial rates waiver will be applied in the first quarter of 2021 to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions. &euro;160 million has been allocated to meet the cost of this waiver and details were issued to local authorities on 27 January 2021.  Automatic eligibility is extended to retail, hospitality including hotels, pubs and restaurants, leisure and entertainment, personal services such as hairdressers and barbers, health services and various other categories.  Businesses in other sectors may engage directly with their local authorities if they can demonstrate serious financial impact and may also qualify for this waiver.<\/p>  <p>  As has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, my Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and with individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic.

Section 4 of the Act and Schedule 2 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, as amended (the Regulations), set out various exemptions from the requirement to obtain planning permission.  Any such exemptions are subject to compliance with any general restrictions on exemptions set out in the Act or the Regulations and to the specific conditions set out in each class of exempted development in Schedule 2 of the Regulations. Included in the specific conditions set out in the Regulations are those applying to the installation of solar infrastructure on a variety of building types, including houses, businesses, industrial and agricultural.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the Climate Action Plan 2019, my Department is currently undertaking a review of the solar panel exemptions, and is actively engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as other key stakeholders, with a view to finalising a proposal for draft amending Regulations to reflect, inter alia, technical developments in the sector. One of the key considerations of the review is to ensure that solar panels can be erected - subject to certain siting and size conditions - without the need to obtain planning permission, thereby facilitating more widespread generation of renewable energy for self-consumption. Also included in this review are solar panel exemptions for educational and community buildings.<\/p>  <p>  The main outstanding issue that remains to be addressed in the current review is the potential for \"glint and glare\" impacts for aircraft and the need to ensure that they do not result in any real or potential threat to aviation safety. Accordingly, my Department is presently engaging with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications as well as the Irish Aviation Authority, in order to find a safe and workable solution in relation to this particular aspect of the review. The Department has begun the tendering process for this project, which will involve the development of aviation safeguarding maps for each airport\/aerodrome in the country, and has received feedback from potential tenderers estimating a timeline of up to 9 months for its completion.

Where it is not legally possible to facilitate postal voting, officials from my Department have engaged intensively with the Embassies to ensure that polling is carried out in a safe manner and in compliance with public health guidelines.<\/p>  <p>  My Department received 16 requests to facilitate the operation of polling stations by 14 foreign Embassies for elections taking place in the past 12 months, namely: Algeria, Chile, Croatia, France, Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, Moldova, Myanmar, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, and Spain. Of these, one election was cancelled before polling could take place, and in two cases polling took place exclusively by post, without the need to open a physical polling station. Polling stations were opened in the other cases. <\/p>  <p>  Under the regulations governing Level 5 restrictions, provision is made to allow for those engaged in providing, or accessing, essential services to move outside the 5km limit. The list of essential services includes &ldquo;The provision of services essential to the functioning of diplomatic missions and consular posts in the State&rdquo;. The Department of Foreign Affairs considers the operation of a polling station by a diplomatic Mission to allow its citizens to vote to be a service essential to the functioning of a diplomatic Mission in the State. <\/p>  <p>  Following written confirmation from the relevant Embassy of its ability to adhere to public health measures, my Department confirms that citizens who are eligible to vote are permitted to travel outside the 5km limit for the express purpose of accessing the polling stations. Voters travelling to the polling stations have to be in a position to present evidence of their entitlement to vote. My Department informs An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of this permission.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100052#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Consular Services","counter":346,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH00200"},{"type":"question","counter":347,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[7787\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of times consular assistance has been provided in circumstances in which an issue has arisen at an airport or other point of international travel due to the fact that a parent or guardian has a different surname from that of his or her child.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":348,"content":"<p>I can advise the Deputy that my Department places the highest priority on providing consular support and assistance to all our citizens, and particularly where a child&rsquo;s interests are concerned. <\/p>  <p>  While there may be instances where issues have arisen at airports or other points of international travel due to the fact that a parent or guardian has a different surname than their child, my Department is not necessarily informed of all of such instances and does not maintain a statistical record in relation to these specific issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH00500"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[7822\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps he is taking to prevent travellers from Dubai, Portugal and other locations from using Dublin Airport as a back door to the UK; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>All passengers arriving into Ireland are required to have a negative\/'not detected&rsquo; result from a pre-departure COVID-19 RT-PCR test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival in Ireland.

Discussions on Junior Cycle examinations will continue in these engagements.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has indicated to the education partners that any corresponding process would need to include the following features:<\/p>  <p>  -  The State Examinations Commission running both the examinations and the corresponding process<\/p>  <p>  -  Better provision for out-of-school learners in the corresponding process<\/p>  <p>  -  Some cognisance of performance in &ldquo;additional component&rdquo; elements of examinations (coursework, orals, practicals, etc.)<\/p>  <p>  -  Timely progression to higher and further education using either examinations or the outcome of any corresponding process<\/p>  <p>  All partners are committed to acting in the interests and wellbeing of students, who are at the heart of this process.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Transport","counter":377,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH03700"},{"type":"question","counter":378,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[7542\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100053#WRH03800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if Bus &Eacute;ireann made a profit from school transport in 2014 and entered this profit in the annual audited profit and loss account and balance sheet for that year; and if her attention has been drawn to information that this figure was entered in the exact same way as Bus &Eacute;ireann entered the profit and-or loss from Expressway and its other commercial business lines.","asker":"1489","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":379,"content":"<p>School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department of Education.

Registration ensures that standards of entry to the profession are maintained. Teachers may apply for registration in the primary, post-primary, further education and other sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The registration of teachers is governed by Section 31 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 and the Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Registration Regulations 2016. My Department is not directly involved in the registration of individual teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants wishing to register as a teacher in the Further Education sector must meet the requirements for registration under Route 3, as set out in the regulations, which are available on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s website at www.teachingcouncil.ie\/en\/Registration\/How-do-I-register-\/.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise members of the Council of Irish Sign Language Teachers (CISLT) to liaise directly with the Teaching Council regarding their registration.<\/p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf\/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.<\/p>  <p>  The total education spend on special education is about &euro;2 Billion - almost a fifth - of the the annual educational and training budget. This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p>  <p>  Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing. In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and\/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.<\/p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children\/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. <\/p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.<\/p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.<\/p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings, parents\/guardians and grandparents. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf\/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme in May 2018. The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017..<\/p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language. It will take some time to introduce and implement this ISL scheme. In the interim these posts are filled, on a case by case basis, through the NCSE to allocate an additional SNA post with appropriate ISL qualifications. They are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  A new undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language), in Dublin City University (DCU), launched in 2019, enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.<\/p>  <p>  Previously, there was no entry route to primary teacher education for someone who communicates through ISL and cannot meet the minimum entry requirement for Irish in Leaving Certificate. This B.Ed. allows ISL to be accepted as an alternative to Irish.

Since the beginning of January, inspectors have engaged with principals in 968 schools, including 272 DEIS schools and provided advice as necessary on how the provision for remote teaching and learning can be further developed. The findings of these telephone surveys of principals indicate that primary and post-primary schools have established and are implementing arrangements for remote provision in almost all cases. The Inspectorate has also carried out surveys of parents in a sample of primary and post-primary schools that included DEIS schools. Initial findings from these surveys  are also positive and indicate that teachers are engaging regularly with their students and that students are receiving regular feedback on their work. The Inspectorate is also working with schools to develop approaches to enable inspectors and schools to evaluate the quality of education provision in a remote learning environment more comprehensively. Further information on the Inspectorate&rsquo;s engagement with schools during this term is available in Circular Letter 0001\/2021. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners, to enable schools to facilitate the continuity of learning for all pupils\/students in a Covid-19 context.

Registration ensures that standards of entry to the profession are maintained. Teachers may apply for registration in the primary, post-primary, further education and other sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The registration of teachers is governed by Section 31 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 and the Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Registration Regulations 2016. My Department is not directly involved in the registration of individual teachers. <\/p>  <p>  Applicants wishing to register as a teacher in the Further Education sector must meet the requirements for registration under Route 3, as set out in the regulations, which are available on the Teaching Council&rsquo;s website at www.teachingcouncil.ie\/en\/Registration\/How-do-I-register-\/.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise members of the Council of Irish Sign Language Teachers (CISLT) to liaise directly with the Teaching Council regarding their registration.<\/p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children who are deaf\/hard of hearing, can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p>  <p>  The total education spend on special education is about &euro;2 Billion - almost a fifth - of the the annual educational and training budget. This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p>  <p>  Included in this provision is an extensive range of supports to assist students who are deaf or hard of hearing. In line with my Department's policy that children with special educational needs access appropriate education intervention in mainstream settings where possible, many deaf or hard of hearing pupils are integrated into mainstream classes at primary and post-primary level, while other children who are deaf or hard of hearing and have more complex needs may attend special schools or classes, which have lower pupil teacher ratios.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service includes Visiting Teachers, who are qualified teachers with particular skills and knowledge of the development and education of children with varying degrees of hearing loss and\/or visual impairment. They offer longitudinal support to children, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.<\/p>  <p>  Each visiting teacher (VT) is responsible for a particular region and is allocated a caseload of students. The VT supports children\/young people, parents, guardians, teachers and other professionals involved with the child. <\/p>  <p>  The frequency and nature of support takes into account a range of factors based on the individual&rsquo;s needs. <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE provide direct support to schools and individual teachers in as flexible a way as possible, offering telephone advice, a school visit from a member of the team, an in-service course for individual teachers, or whole-school training. Whole-school training will ensure that all teachers are equipped to cater for the pupils&rsquo; educational needs, as they progress through primary and post primary school.<\/p>  <p>  Among the courses towards which funding is provided to schools are courses in Irish Sign Language, which are available throughout the country through a variety of providers.<\/p>  <p>  Additional supports provided by my Department include funding to schools for assistive technology such as radio aids and Soundfield systems, special transport arrangements for pupils, and enhanced levels of capitation in special classes and special schools.<\/p>  <p>  Funding is also provided by my Department for a weekly home tuition service whereby tutors visit the homes of deaf and hard of hearing pre-school children and school-going pupils to provide training in Irish Sign Language (ISL) for these children, their siblings, parents\/guardians and grandparents. <\/p>  <p>  Reasonable accommodations and supports are made available to support children with special educational needs, including students who are deaf\/hard of hearing, to participate in state exams.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE published the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme in May 2018. The report recommends that Irish Sign Language (ISL) qualified assistants should be put in place to support profoundly deaf students whose primary language is ISL and that this should be aligned to the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017..<\/p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of this review and the requirements of the Irish Sign Language Act 2017, a scheme will be developed to provide Irish Sign Language support for students attending recognised schools, whose primary language is Irish Sign Language. It will take some time to introduce and implement this ISL scheme. In the interim these posts are filled, on a case by case basis, through the NCSE to allocate an additional SNA post with appropriate ISL qualifications. They are employed on similar terms and conditions to SNAs. The purpose of these posts is to enable these students attend school and access the curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  A new undergraduate programme, Bachelor of Education (Irish Sign Language), in Dublin City University (DCU), launched in 2019, enables deaf and hard of hearing people who use Irish Sign Language (ISL) to enter primary teaching.<\/p>  <p>  Previously, there was no entry route to primary teacher education for someone who communicates through ISL and cannot meet the minimum entry requirement for Irish in Leaving Certificate. This B.Ed. allows ISL to be accepted as an alternative to Irish. It is an important step towards ensuring increased access and inclusion for all in the classroom.<\/p>  <p>  It is envisaged that, when qualified, these students will teach in schools for the deaf or special classes in mainstream schools.

Since implementation of the Policy commenced in 2017, funding in the region of &euro;14m has been made available for a range of measures to support the provision of high quality Irish-medium education in Gaeltacht schools. These measures include the launch of the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme, which provides targeted additional supports to schools located in Gaeltacht language-planning areas to support and enhance their provision of Irish-medium education. Currently 105 primary and 29 post-primary Gaeltacht schools in the Scheme are receiving additional language support hours for Irish, additional CPD provided by COGG, an annual grant of &euro;1200 for the purchase of Irish-medium teaching resources and additional inspectorate advisory visits. At post-primary level, schools were given the opportunity to take part in the e-hub pilot project, which utilises online blended-learning provision to extend the range of subjects available through the medium of Irish to students in post-primary Gaeltacht schools. In addition, selected schools have been provided with an opportunity to take part in the For&aacute;s programme, which provides additional language support to students in Junior Cycle.<\/p><p>A specific package of supports, additional to the supports being provided under the Gaeltacht School Recognition Scheme, is being made available to post-primary schools located on islands due to the particular challenges which they face and their importance in preserving the vitality of island communities. This package includes additional teacher allocation and a ring-fenced budget of an additional &euro;15000 per annum to cover additional operational costs for each island school.<\/p><p>In recent years, a number of measures have been implemented to improve the appointment and retention thresholds for small primary schools, including more favourable enrolment thresholds for one teacher schools and island schools. These include a one-point reduction to the pupil-teacher ratio for small schools (four teachers and less) from the 2020\/21 school year. Budget 2021 builds on this progress by implementing a further 1 point reduction for the appointment of a teacher in the 2021\/22 school year and a three point reduction in the retention schedule.  These measures will help to ensure that less pupils are required to recruit or retain a teacher.  The staffing schedule for the 2021\/22 school year will be published in the coming weeks.  It is at this stage that primary schools will be able to establish their staffing for the coming September and the redeployment process to fill teaching vacancies will begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":418,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02200"},{"type":"question","counter":419,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[7672\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress being made, relative to the funding required, on a building project at a school (details supplied); if the additional costs caused by the conditions attached to the planning permission will be approved; the number of meetings held between her Department and the school relative to the overall costs of the project since planning permission was granted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1496","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":420,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that the school referred to has been approved for a project under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme 2015.

The Framework gives students the opportunity to develop a wider range of knowledge and skills &ndash; to equip them for further learning, for work, for responsible and active citizenship, and for healthy living. The Junior Cycle has been developed and implemented over several years, with the final phase of new subject specifications being introduced to schools from September 2019. The new subject specification for History was developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) and introduced from September 2018.<\/p><p>When schools in Ireland implement the Framework for Junior Cycle, they have the autonomy and flexibility to design programmes within the parameters of the framework, mindful in particular of the needs of their students and their teaching resources.  This allows decisions on what is offered within these programmes to be at the discretion of the school, and students to have as broad a range of options to choose from as possible.<\/p><p>In the Framework for Junior Cycle, all schools are expected to provide opportunities for students to achieve 24 statements of learning over the period of Junior Cycle. These statements include valuing local, national and international heritage and understanding the importance of the relationship between past and current events, the forces that drive change, and understanding the origins and impacts of social, economic and environmental aspects of the world around them.  <\/p><p>The specification for Junior Cycle History provides a framework for students to acquire the historical skills, conceptual understanding and substantive knowledge that lead to a sense of historical consciousness, whereby students can see the world and their place in it from a historical perspective. It has been designed for a minimum of 200 hours of timetabled student engagement across the three years of Junior Cycle.  The specification has three interconnected strands, each with a set or related elements: the nature of history, the history of Ireland, and the history of Europe and the wider world.<\/p><p>As a result of the learning outcomes approach, teachers can facilitate discussion around a wide range of periods of Irish history and culture, as well as the many other issues which might arise during the course of a class. For example, in Learning Outcome 1.3 (Junior Cycle History) students are asked to appreciate their cultural inheritance through recognising historically significant places and buildings and discussing why historical personalities, events and issues are commemorated.<\/p><p>The two Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) in the Junior Cycle specification allow students to explore topics that are interesting and relevant to their own lives. In A Life in Time, students choose a person from the past and explore why that person is historically significant, while The Past in my Place, allows students to present their findings on a study of an aspect of their home place that they consider of interest.  <\/p><p>In October 2019, the Minister for Education announced that History should have special core status within the Framework for Junior Cycle. Further details in this regard are set out in Circular Letters 0076\/2020 and 0016\/2020. From September 2020, students will study English, Irish, Mathematics and History (with some exceptions in the case of students with special educational needs), along with a number of other subjects or short courses in their Junior Cycle programme.<\/p><p>The NCCA is also developing a short course in History for certain students with general learning difficulties\/needs. Students in this category will not be required to study the subject ahead of the new short course being made available in September 2021.<\/p><p>Across each of the strands and strand units of the curriculum, teachers have flexibility in determining the content which is to be taught and are encouraged to expose pupils to a range of perspectives, which could include discussions on the ancient Kingdom of Mide.<\/p><p>The broad objectives of the primary school history curriculum (National Council for Curriculum and Assessment NCCA, 1999) state that children should develop a sense of responsibility for, and a willingness to participate in, the preservation of heritage; that children should study a range of people and events in the past in order to develop a balanced understanding of family, local, national and world history; and that children should learn about the people, events, issues and cultural experiences which have helped to shape the local community and the environment. The units selected by the school and teacher should introduce children to the lives of women, men and children from a range of social, cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds, include studies from a wide range of human experience (e.g. economic, technological, scientific, artistic, social, cultural, religious, political, etc.); and come from local, national and international contexts. <\/p><p>One of the strands in the history curriculum at primary level is <i>Early People and Ancient Societies<\/i>. Teachers have the autonomy to select the areas studied from a range of peoples including, for example, the Stone Age; the Bronze Age; the Celts; Early Christian Ireland; and the Vikings. In studying <i>Early People and Ancient societies<\/i>, the child should be enabled to<\/p><p>-  become familiar with some aspects of the lives of these peoples, their origins, homelands and migrations, homes, settlements and urban developments, food and farming, clothes, work and technologies, tools and weapons, cultural or artistic achievements, language(s), myths and stories, leisure and pastimes, faith, beliefs and religious practices, burial practices, etc.<\/p><p>-  examine critically, and become familiar with, evidence we have which tells us about these people, especially evidence of these people which may be found locally and in Ireland, where appropriate <\/p><p>-  record the place of these peoples on appropriate timelines.<\/p><p>The NCCA is currently developing a draft primary school curriculum framework, from which the curriculum for each subject areas will be redeveloped, including History. The first stage of consultation is now closed, but the NCCA intends to open a second stage consultation in the school year 2021-22. During the consultation phase, submissions are accepted from schools, teachers, parents, special interest groups and general members of the public.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":424,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":425,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[7714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a copy of any recommendations made to her, her Department or Ministers of State in her Department by the advisory group on the leaving certificate since December 2020 to 8 February 2021 will be provided.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":156,"qnumall":"[7715\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ03000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a copy of minutes or copies of minutes forwarded to her, her Department or Ministers of State in her Department arising from the meetings of the advisory group on the leaving certificate since December 2020 to 8 February 2021 will be provided.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":427,"qnumday":157,"qnumall":"[7716\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100054#WRJ03100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if a copy of briefing documents prepared for her arising from meetings of the advisory group on the leaving certificate since December 2020 to 8 February 2021 will be provided.","asker":"1551","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":428,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 to 157, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The planning work underway in respect of the State Examinations in 2021 is being assisted by an Advisory Group of key stakeholders which has met on a number of occasions in recent months.

I have met with F&oacute;rsa, who represent many of the secretaries working in schools.<\/p>  <p>  In recognition of their role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.  I have also extended the Employee Assistance Service to all school staff including secretaries. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under grant schemes. Where a school employs a staff member to support those functions those staff are employees of individual schools and responsibility for terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department implemented the 2015 recommendations of an independent arbitrator. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019 and has been fully implemented. <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019 been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>  F&oacute;rsa trade union has tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 agreement.

The scheme supports recipients by assisting with the cost of communications and\/or home security solutions. <\/p>  <p>  The TSA is one of a number of supports that recipients of State Pension payments may, subject to satisfying eligibility conditions, have access to.

The guidance, which was fully revised in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act, is intended to assist members of the public, professionals, employees or volunteers in identifying and reporting concerns about child abuse and neglect to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. It sets out definitions of abuse, and signs for its recognition. It explains how reports about reasonable concerns of child abuse or neglect should be made by the general public and professionals to Tusla. It sets out what organisations need to do to keep children safe. It also describes the obligations under the Children First Act 2015 and who they attach to. The definitions of abuse set out in the guidance refer to internationally recognised and agreed categories of abuse. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has a statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991 to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Tusla assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it and takes appropriate actions, including referrals to appropriate services and agencies, dependant on assessment outcomes.

Accordingly it is not currently intended to expand the definitions of abuse set out in the guidelines to include children who are a risk themselves from behavioural or other issues.

Closed services have reduced operating costs.<\/p>  <p>  The eligibility criteria for the COSP include that the total value of DCEDIY funding schemes (ECCE, AIM, NCS, legacy schemes) allocated to the service in the week ending 13 December 2020 must be less than 45% of the &lsquo;calculated-income-capacity&rsquo; of the service, which is an estimate of the maximum expected total income for the service in the absence of the EWSS. As registered ELC and SAC services are exempt from the income-loss threshold for the EWSS, services that are ineligible for the COSP are expected to have on average 50% of their operating costs met by the EWSS and more than 45% of their costs met by other DCEDIY funding schemes. For services ineligible for COSP, even a very low level of occupancy or zero occupancy would be sufficient for a service to meet its operating costs. <\/p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that some services that are reliant on parental fees may not meet the criteria &ndash; it is open to such services to apply for the Sustainability Fund if the service has sustainability concerns as a result of the current restrictions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100057#WRM02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency","counter":602,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100057#WRM02600"},{"type":"question","counter":603,"qnumday":217,"qnumall":"[7805\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100057#WRM02700","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the proposals to extend a programme (details supplied) to other areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":604,"content":"<p>The Tusla ABC Programme within Prevention Partnership and Family Support, is an area based Prevention and Early Intervention initiative which is delivered in 12 areas of significant socio-economic disadvantage across the country.<\/p>  <p>  Strategic discussions continue to take place across the Tusla ABC programme with key stakeholders to explore what potential aspects of the ABC model could be scaled or replicated to broaden the reach and share the learning of the programme.

The minimum price is determined solely by the amount of alcohol in the product.  Minimum unit pricing sets a floor price below which alcohol cannot be sold. Alcohol can be sold above this price but not below it and evidence has shown that Minimum Unit Pricing will not affect the majority of alcohol products but targets only alcohol products that are currently very cheap relative to their strength. <\/p><p>The 2013 Government Decision which approved the implementation of minimum pricing in Ireland envisaged that it would be introduced here and in Northern Ireland simultaneously. This was to allay concerns that its introduction in the Republic only would impact cross-border trade. <\/p><p>Legislation to introduce a minimum unit price has not yet been introduced in Northern Ireland however in July last year, the Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann committed to a public consultation on minimum pricing for alcohol in Northern Ireland which will begin following the launch of the new Northern Ireland Substance Use Strategy early this year. <\/p><p>In 2013, my Department commissioned research from the University of Sheffield to estimate the effect of a range of Minimum Unit Prices, and other pricing policies, on low risk, increasing risk and high-risk drinkers. The findings included that:<\/p><p>- A ban on below-cost selling (implemented as a ban on selling alcohol for below the cost of duty and Value Added Tax) would have a negligible impact on alcohol consumption or related harms.<\/p><p>- A 10c per gram of alcohol or &euro;1 for 10 grams of alcohol minimum unit price would be an effective measure to reduce alcohol consumption among high risk drinkers, leading to significant reductions in alcohol-related harm.<\/p><p>- Lower risk drinkers would experience smaller impacts on their alcohol consumption and spending as a result of the introduction of a 10c per gram of alcohol MUP.<\/p><p>- Large duty increases of between 53% and 78% would be required to achieve the same reductions in alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable deaths as a 10c per gram of alcohol MUP.  These duty increases would have a greater impact on the consumption and spending of low risk drinkers than a 10c per gram MUP.<\/p><p>- The introduction of a 10c per gram of alcohol MUP was estimated to reduce the amount that high risk drinkers spend on alcohol, in contrast to duty increases which would increase it.  Larger duty increases lead to large increases in spending on alcohol for all drinkers.<\/p><p>Also, in 2013, CJP Consultants were commissioned by my Department to examine the following price control measures:<\/p><p>- Minimum Unit Pricing;<\/p><p>- The reintroduction of a ban on below cost selling;<\/p><p>- Making the sales price of alcohol cover at least VAT plus excise and<\/p><p>- Excise fiscal measures.<\/p><p>The Report concluded that Minimum Unit Pricing is the best policy option, it would prove very beneficial as a public health measure and it would need to be accompanied by other measures to make it most effective in lowering consumption.<\/p><p>In 2016, my Department commissioned further research from the University of Sheffield to evaluate the comparative impacts of Minimum Unit Pricing and alcohol taxation increases.<\/p><p>I am happy to provide the Deputy with this research if he wishes to have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Dental Services ","counter":784,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04500"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":283,"qnumall":"[7704\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason medical card patients are currently not being seen for emergency medical dental treatment; when emergency dental treatment will be available for medical card holders; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":786,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":787,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04800"},{"type":"question","counter":788,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[7705\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP04900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) is being asked to provide a notice of assessment of form 11 tax return in order to process their medical card application when the PCRS has been furnished with a statement of liability in respect of their form 12 submission showing a trading loss; the reason the application is not being processed given that official documentary evidence from the Revenue Commissioners in the form of a statement of liability has been furnished in order to process same; if he will acknowledge the documentary evidence that has been furnished to the client registration unit showing a trading loss and process the application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":789,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP05000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic","counter":790,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP05100"},{"type":"question","counter":791,"qnumday":285,"qnumall":"[7713\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100060#WRP05200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a matter (details supplied) will be reviewed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":792,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19  provides a framework setting out Ireland's approach to managing and living with COVID-19. <\/p><p>The framework sets out five levels of response, each with a number of measures designed to help us all lower COVID-19 transmission and setting out what is permitted at that moment in time. It is framed to account for periods during which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally. It recognises the need for society and business to be allowed to continue as normally as possible and is designed so that either national or county level restrictions can be applied. <\/p><p>The Plan reflects a careful consideration of the impact of the introduction of restrictions on employment and livelihoods, keeping as many businesses open as possible at different stages, while acknowledging that some businesses and services are critical.<\/p><p>As I am sure the Deputy can appreciate, COVID-19 spreads when individuals and groups come into close contact with one another, enabling the virus to move from one person to another. COVID-19 is infectious in a person with no symptoms, or for the period of time before they develop symptoms. For this reason, we are all asked to be extra careful. For now, we must act like we have the virus to protect those around us from infection.<\/p><p>As you are aware, Ireland is currently at level 5 of the plan.  The current Covid-19 restrictions limit the attendance at funerals to 10 mourners.  Priority must  be given to families themselves in attending funerals, whether this is in the homes of the deceased or in the Funeral Home. Likewise attendance in churches and graveyards is restricted to families.<\/p><p>In this third wave we now sadly see a significant increase in the numbers of funerals. Concerns are being raised regarding the dangers of dropping our guard at funerals when we are at this critical time in trying to level off the deadly curve. Reports of significant numbers of people congregating in homes of bereaved persons and in funeral homes, or at churches and graveyards before or after services, are very concerning.<\/p><p>The inclement weather we have at this time of year can result in those lining funeral routes at times congregating in doorways of churches and other areas along the route to seek shelter.

The Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to continuing investment in our health care services in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review and the commitments in Project Ireland 2040.<\/p>  <p>  The Health Service Capacity Review 2018 found that the net requirement in combination with health system reform is for an additional 2,590 hospital beds by 2031 (2,100 inpatient, 300 day case and 190 critical care). The National Development Plan provides for the addition of the full 2,590 beds by 2027. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is working with the HSE to increase acute capacity in hospitals throughout the country to meet Covid 19 and other health demands. Government allocated &euro;236 million revenue and &euro;40 million capital expenditure as part of Budget 2021 to fund additional acute beds on a permanent basis. This funding will provide, by the end of 2021, an additional 1,146 acute beds (excluding critical care beds). As part of this, over 400 beds, opened in 2019\/2020 on a temporary basis, will remain open on a permanent basis.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a proportion of these 1,146 beds are being provided as part of the HSE&rsquo;s Winter Plan 2020\/21. The Winter Plan aims to provide additional health service capacity across a range of services. Initiatives comprise additional acute and community beds to increase acute capacity, help reduce admissions and facilitate egress. The HSE has reported that 427 of these beds had opened by 4th February. This represents a significant step towards achieving the recommendations in the 2018 Health Service Capacity Review.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, significant additional critical care capacity has been put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, with funding for 40 additional adult critical care beds provided in March 2020. A Strategic Plan for Critical Care was noted by Government in December 2020 and aims to bring permanent adult critical care capacity in Ireland to 321 by the end of 2021 and to 446 in the long term, in line with the recommendations of the Health Service Capacity Review. <\/p>  <p>  A total of &euro;52m was provided to advance the Critical Care Strategic Plan in Budget 2021. This will retain, on a permanent basis, the 40 adult critical care beds put in place on a temporary basis last year and add significant new build bed capacity, as well as allowing for the development of a workforce plan and education initiatives to grow the critical care workforce.  <\/p>  <p>  However, where necessary, the number of critical care beds can surge beyond the baseline of 280-285 as part of an emergency response. This is the scenario that our hospitals are in now. The HSE has advised that surge capacity up to around 350 is possible while maintaining clinical risk at an acceptable level. The greater the reliance on surge ICU capacity, the greater the clinical risk with potential impact on patient outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  The situation which is now being faced by our critical care units presents a greater challenge than even the first wave of COVID. While there are indications the number of patients in ICU are plateauing at a high level, it remains essential that we stay at home and reduce the transmission of Covid-19 in the community as much as we possibly can as the only way to reduce the numbers of Covid patients requiring ICU care. <\/p>  <p>  Following the termination of the original private hospital agreement in June, the Government mandated the HSE to seek to agree with the private hospitals a new arrangement which would provide the HSE with access to private hospital capacity to include a safety net arrangement for any further surge of Covid-19 cases. The HSE has advised that all 18 hospitals have now signed Service Level Agreements to provide additional hospital capacity to the HSE, to deal with the surge in Covid-19 cases and any further surges in the pandemic, if they arise within the next 12 months. The arrangement is valid for 12 months and is a standard agreement for all 18 hospitals. Under the arrangement, the hospitals have agreed to supply, depending on the incidence of the disease or the number of patients with Covid-19 in public hospitals, up to 15% or 30% of their capacity. The additional capacity provided by the private hospitals is critical to enabling the public health system cope with large scale surges in the incidences of the disease. It is intended to use the capacity of the private hospitals for urgent, time-dependant and complex care.<\/p>  <p>  It is recognised that waiting times for scheduled appointments and procedures have been impacted in the last year as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The HSE is currently recommending that only critical time dependent elective procedures are undertaken at this time due to the on-going and significant increased demand for bed capacity related to Covid-19. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and to ensure patient safety and that all appropriate resources were made available for Covid-19 related activity and time-critical essential work. Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":813,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ01400"},{"type":"question","counter":814,"qnumday":293,"qnumall":"[7737\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ01500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which he remains satisfied that non-Covid hospital procedures continue in sufficient scale to meet the demand; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":815,"qnumday":294,"qnumall":"[7738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ01600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which more than average noticeable waiting lists have built up or are likely to build up arising from Covid-19-related demands and requirements; if backlogs remain manageable; the most apparent disciplines under stress at present; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":816,"qnumday":295,"qnumall":"[7739\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is satisfied that the provisions currently in place to deal with non-Covid-19-related health demands are sufficient in every respect; his plans for specific changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":817,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293 to 295, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Scheduled care activity was significantly impacted in 2020 by the necessary decision, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) advice to defer most routine elective care appointments and procedures in March, April, and May last year. As a result of the significant disruption in services, hospital waiting list figures at the end of December 2020 were higher than at the start of the year, with the Inpatient \/ Daycase waiting list 9% higher than at the start of January last year, the Outpatient waiting list 10% higher and the G.I. Endoscopy waiting list showing the greatest percentage growth with a 46% increase. However, the rate of patient referral on to the GI. Endoscopy waiting list declined by just 1% year on year compared to a drop of 13% and 20% in referral rates for IPDC and OPD respectively.<\/p><p>As a result of the deferral of scheduled care, waiting lists reached a peak in May with 86,946 patients waiting for a procedure. With the resumption of scheduled care in June, the HSE took steps to improve patient pathways in the context of the pandemic and infection control measures, and worked to secure new routes to treatment. For example, the HSE sought to optimise productivity through alternative work practices such as telemedicine and the use of alternative settings including private hospitals, community facilities and atypical outpatient settings. <\/p><p>  As a result of this concerted effort, and supported by the work of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the waiting lists for the top ten high volume Inpatient\/ Day Case procedures continued to improve from May 2020 onwards, though it is recognised that some procedures were either slower to recover or are more challenged. More specifically, while by the end of December 2020 cystoscopies, skin lesions, and laparoscopic cholecystectomies had not returned to pre-Covid numbers, it is of note that the number of patients on waiting lists for cataracts, hips\/knees, tonsils, septoplasties, dental maxillofacial, and veins had almost returned to pre-Covid figures, if not slightly better. <\/p><p>The work of the HSE to improve access to elective care and reduce waiting times for patients is supported by the NTPF, who in 2020 reviewed strategies to maximise activity and benefit for patients. This included increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services where minor procedures are provided at the same time as outpatient consultations, funding hybrid services where public and private hospitals contribute to the treatment of patients, virtual clinics and clinical validation.<\/p><p>At the 16<sup>th<\/sup>of December 2020 the NTPF had arranged 31,615 IPDC treatments and 11,504 G.I. Scopes. In terms of Outpatients, the NTPF had approved in principal 70,297 Outpatient appointments. The NTPF was also sanctioned to provide additional diagnostic supports through Emergency Department Authorisation Notifications (EDANs), which allow sites to access available diagnostic capacity in both the public and private sectors to a value of &euro;4m.  <\/p><p>&euro;240 million has been provided in Budget 2021 to fund access to care, &euro;210m of which has been allocated to the HSE and a further &euro;30m to the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the provision of treatment as required in both private and public hospitals in order to address capacity issues in acute hospitals and waiting lists. <\/p><p>On 2<sup>nd<\/sup>January 2021, the HSE issued correspondence to the Acute hospital system advising of the need to curtail routine scheduled elective care. This decision was made arising from the rapid increase in Covid-19 admissions and the projected trend in admissions based upon community transmission levels of Covid-19.

People with diabetes are unable to metabolize glucose appropriately and as a result, blood glucose levels remain above normal levels and over time can damage blood vessels. This can lead to long-term damage and disabling and potentially fatal health complications. In high-income countries, including Ireland, diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease, blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputation.<\/p>  <p>  The most common form of diabetes is type 2, which typically occurs in adults, although it is increasingly seen in young people, including children. Type 1 diabetes typically occurs in children or young people. The third main type of diabetes is gestational diabetes, which occurs because the action of insulin is impaired during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes is becoming increasingly common against rising levels of overweight and obesity as key risk factors. Those with type 1 diabetes require a regular supply of insulin, while type 2 diabetes is largely preventable and complications can be avoided or delayed through a combination of lifestyle changes, medications or insulin therapy, depending on the status of the condition and the stage of the disease in the person concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Globally, the number of people with diabetes has doubled during the past 20 years, making it one of the most important public health challenges facing national health care systems today. The International Diabetes Federation has recently (2019) estimated that approximately 463 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes globally and that by 2045 this will rise to 700 million. In Ireland it is estimated that there are 190,000 people with diabetes. Approximately 30,000 (15%) of these have Type 1 diabetes, or genetic or secondary causes of diabetes. The remaining 160,000 (85%) patients have Type 2 diabetes with a significant proportion of these patients remaining undiagnosed. It is expected that the number of people with Type 2 diabetes will increase by 60% over the next 10-15 years.<\/p>  <p>  The challenge posed by the changing disease burden has been recognized globally, with diabetes featuring high on national and international agendas including the World Health Organisation and the European Commission. At national level countries in Europe have made progress towards developing a systematic policy response to the diabetes burden. Effective treatment reduces the risk of disability or fatal complications and its optimal management requires coordinated inputs from a wide range of health professionals, access to essential medicines and monitoring, and, ideally, a system that promotes patient empowerment and well-coordinated care. In that context in Ireland the HSE Clinical Programme in Diabetes leads the multidisciplinary coordinated response to the challenges posed by diabetes in Ireland and I have asked them to examine the matters raised by the Deputy and provide a response to him as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":836,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":837,"qnumday":302,"qnumall":"[7746\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100061#WRQ04000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which provision is being made to cater for mental health patients who may also have an addiction;

Convergence is a mechanism whereby the value of payment entitlements move away from historic reference points towards the national average value for all farmers, large and small.

This is the most stringent capping limit available to Member States under the current regulations.

Payment is based on the number of payment entitlements activated in the scheme year, subject to a maximum of 50.  Since the introduction of the Young Farmers Scheme in 2015 support has been granted to young famers who have commenced their agricultural activities since 2010.  There is no provision within the EU Regulations to provide for support to young farmers who commenced their agricultural activity prior to 2010.  In line with EU Regulation 2393\/2017 (Omnibus Regulation), since 2018 a young farmer who commenced farming from 2014 onwards and who submits his\/her first Young Farmers Scheme application within five years of commencement of farming may receive payment under the scheme for the maximum period of five years.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, from 2015 the &lsquo;young farmer&rsquo; priority category of the National Reserve has also provided support to young farmers who have commenced their agricultural activity since 2010.  The National Reserve provides an allocation of payment entitlements on eligible &lsquo;naked&rsquo; land or increases the value of entitlements below the national average to bring them up to the national average. In 2015 the National Reserve also provided support on a once-off basis to a group of farmers called \"Old Young Farmers\".  This was a category of young farmers who had commenced their agricultural activity in 2008 and 2009 but had suffered the disadvantage of not having had access to Installation Aid available at the time of their initial set up.  <\/p>  <p>  &lsquo;Forgotten Farmer&rsquo; is a term used to describe a group of farmers who had set up their agricultural holdings prior to 2008, were still under 40 in 2015 and held low value payment entitlements, but were ineligible as young farmers under the National Reserve.  As the purpose of the National Reserve is to provide support to farmers in their early years following the establishment of an agricultural holding, the 'Forgotten Farmer' group did not meet the eligibility requirements.  The group sought to be considered under the National Reserve as a group suffering from specific disadvantage.  As outlined previously, there is no basis in EU Regulations under which this group can meet the eligibility requirements for the Young Farmers Scheme payment.<\/p>  <p>  EU Regulations governing the National Reserve provide that the two categories of young farmer and new entrant to farming must receive priority access to the Reserve.  Since 2018, under the Omnibus Regulation,  Member States may use the proceeds of a linear cut to fund specific disadvantage categories under the National Reserve but only if a linear cut is required to fund the two priority categories of young farmer and new entrant to farming in that particular year.  Since 2018, the National Reserve has been funded without the requirement for a linear cut to the value of all payment entitlements and this is also the case for 2021.  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve, including the basis of funding the Reserve, are made in consultation with the Direct Payments Advisory Committee which comprises members of the farming organisations and farm advisory services.<\/p>  <p>  I am fully committed to addressing this issue in a way that is fair to this cohort of farmers under the next CAP as outlined in the Programme for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100063#WRS01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Exceptional Aid Measure","counter":933,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100063#WRS02000"},{"type":"question","counter":934,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[7724\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021100063#WRS02100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he is taking to allow flexibility in the implementation of the BEAM 5% nitrogen reduction criteria in view of the response from the European Commission; when the online calculator will go live; if he will ensure that farmers have access to the calculator for at least 12 months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1603","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":935,"content":"<p>The Beef Exceptional Aid Measure (BEAM) provided temporary exceptional adjustment aid to farmers in the beef sector in Ireland, subject to the conditions set out in EU Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019\/1132.
