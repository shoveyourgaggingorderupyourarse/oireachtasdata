I am accompanied by Mr. Declan Hughes, head of our indigenous enterprise, SMEs and entrepreneurship division.  Due to Covid restrictions Mr. Cathal O&rsquo;Gorman, our finance officer, is joining the meeting by video conference.<\/p> <p>  First, I will set out our overall funding and our capital and current ceilings in expenditure report 2021.  Our gross allocation for 2021 is &euro;1.127 billion, made up of &euro;359.5 million in current and &euro;768 million in capital.  This is an increase of &euro;155 million, almost 16%, on our budget 2020 allocation of &euro;972.5 million.  Current for 2021 will increase by &euro;19 million and capital by &euro;136 million.<\/p> <p>  This increase in our capital and current allocations builds on the significant additional funding the Department received this year to roll out much needed enterprise supports to help them respond to Covid and Brexit.  The Revised Estimate approved by the D&aacute;il in June provided the Department with an additional &euro;483 million in capital, and a further &euro;450 million for the Department was agreed as part of the Government&rsquo;s July jobs stimulus.  This more than doubling of our original 2020 allocation allowed us to provide immediate targeted supports to enterprises impacted by Covid through measures such as the restart grant.<\/p> <p>  As regards budget 2021 increases, and specifically the additional &euro;136 million in capital moneys allocated to the Department, it is intended that &euro;35 million of this will be for IDA Ireland.  This will enable it to provide a further &euro;10 million to support its property programme which has delivered seven advance building solutions - technological or office buildings - providing attractive turnkey building solutions in regional locations.  Some &euro;30 million will fund the expansion of the innovative Covid life products scheme with &euro;25 million through IDA Ireland and &euro;5 million through Enterprise Ireland.  This joint initiative will aid research, development and production of medicinal products to fight against Covid.  The scheme will deliver significant economic benefits in jobs and returns to the Exchequer as well as societal benefits.<\/p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s capital funding will increase by &euro;50 million.  Of this, &euro;10 million will be for the sustaining enterprise fund providing supports for business continuity through direct grants, equity and repayable advances.  Some &euro;15 million will be for the ready for customs scheme which assists SMEs with staff, software and IT systems to be ready for new customs arrangements from 1 January 2021.  Some &euro;15 million will be for further calls under the regional enterprise development fund investing in projects to support existing jobs and create new ones to strengthen the regional economy, while &euro;5 million will be for the online retail scheme to enable Irish-owned retailers to enhance their digital capability.<\/p> <p>  The local enterprise offices will get an additional &euro;6 million to support the ever-increasing demand for their services which has seen further significant growth in light of Covid and Brexit.  InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s funding will increase by &euro;675,000 to increase the practical supports it provides to businesses trading cross-Border which will be even more important from 1 January 2021.<\/p> <p>  The remainder of our increased capital allocation will be for access to finance measures.  Of this, &euro;25 million will fund liabilities under the Covid credit guarantee scheme, the largest such financial instrument in the history of the State.  Some &euro;14.325 million will strengthen the lending capacity under the future growth loan scheme providing loans of up to ten years to eligible businesses to support strategic long-term investment.  Some &euro;5 million will further capitalise Microfinance Ireland to continue its tailored Covid loans to microenterprises.<\/p> <p>  The &euro;19 million increase in the Department&rsquo;s current ceiling includes &euro;3 million for the public service stability pay agreement in 2021.  The other &euro;16 million will mainly be directed at increasing the resources of the Department&rsquo;s regulatory bodies as they respond to Brexit and Covid.<\/p> <p>  Some &euro;8 million will be allocated to the Health and Safety Authority, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Additional current funding will also be provided to our enterprise agencies to continue expanding their global footprint and increase their promotion and awareness activities in 2021.<\/p> <p>  The Department also continues to be proactive in reaching out to assist businesses in navigating their way through the Covid pandemic.  The additional funding secured for the Department in the July stimulus and which has been retained through budget 2021 enabled us to beef up our dedicated business support call centre where businesses can get details of the full range of enterprise supports available to them.  Since its establishment on 16 March, the centre has answered almost 10,000 calls and emails on supports available for businesses from our Department and other Departments.  Almost three quarters of the calls have related to business supports and the other quarter to restrictions.<\/p> <p>  The Department has also adjusted a number of its administrative procedures in light of Covid, for example, it put in place contingency plans to ensure that the employment permits system can continue to operate in all scenarios for the duration of the Covid-19 crisis.<\/p> <p>  The budget also provided for the establishment of a &euro;3.4 billion recovery fund for additional Government decisions in 2021 to stimulate increased domestic demand and employment.  While the funding under the recovery fund has yet to be formally allocated, at least &euro;100 million will be provided by way of targeted enterprise supports.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in his budget announcement set out the particular initiatives that will benefit from this funding, including: the transformation of the food processing industry post Brexit; meeting increased demands on services of the local enterprise offices; development of the advanced manufacturing centre; Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s online retail scheme and sustaining enterprise fund; calls under the regional enterprise development fund; support for early-stage innovative Irish companies with global ambition through Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s seed and venture programme; the future growth loan scheme and Microfinance Ireland; and the European network of digital innovation hubs to help companies improve their processes, products and services by use of digital technologies.<\/p> <p>  The budget also provided for a range of additional enterprise supports through other Departments, as well as taxation measures designed to support business.  This is an outline of the measures to support enterprise from the additional funding provided to our Department in budget 2021.  These measures are additional to core enterprise supports that continue to be delivered by the Department and our agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline Mulligan"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Mulligan for her opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#C00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for the opening statement.

It was announced as part of the July stimulus package.  It did require a couple of steps in order to go through; the first was legislation and the second was approval at EU level from a state aid perspective, all of which was achieved in very quick order during August and it was launched in early September with the three pillar banks.  There has been very significant interest in it.  I can report that, as of last Friday, 1,200 application had been recommended by the banks to their credit departments.  They had gone through all of the initial stages and they were in the final stages of being approved to a value of approximately &euro;64 million.  What was reported was the amount for the previous weeks in terms of what was actually drawn down in terms of the &euro;6 million, but we would expect that to increase significantly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#D01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>Could I just ask about the relationship between the application and the numbers that actually draw down.

Businesses are obviously taking precautionary measures to ensure that we have the necessary cover.  They apply, go through the application process and then they get approval from the bank.  The next stage involves drawing down the funding.  We saw that at the start of the crisis in March and April when we saw a spike in overdraft applications and facilities being put in place but not actually being drawn down.  What we are saying to businesses is to ensure that they have the facilities in place, in particular now with the credit guarantee scheme, but for Covid, and to cope with the unknown we face in the coming weeks, but also in the context of Brexit.  The credit guarantee scheme is a facility that provides essentially six-year money of up to &euro;3 million at attractive rates from the pillar banks.  We have also just completed an open call and we have a number of other parties, financial institutions and lenders in the market, who are interested in participating in that.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the numbers that are going through the credit application process, I think it was about 850 on the previous Friday and it was up to 1,250 last Friday, an increase of nearly 50% on the applications that are being processed through the banks.  The banks are reporting strong and brisk interest.  We will report next week on the numbers of applications, those that have been approved by the banks and the actual drawdown so we will have a good picture of what is happening in each of those areas.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question on why businesses might not take part in the scheme, we know from surveys by ISME and others that 60% of businesses did not have debt facilities previously, so for some of them they may be reluctant to take on debt.  They are also assessing their financial position and working through in terms of their financial planning.  That has been one of the areas on which the local enterprise offices have been working very closely with businesses through their business continuity vouchers sector to make sure they have those financial plans in place.  We anticipate that the demand for the credit guarantee scheme would step up.  As I indicated, in the first five weeks we had 1,200 go through to the final stages and it will step up significantly in the coming weeks.  We saw something similar with Microfinance Ireland, MFI, during the summer where we had an acceleration in its loan applications to small businesses.  Up to &euro;19 million was approved up to July, and then that tailed off as the economy began to reopen.  MFI, for example, would stand ready now to support businesses over the coming period, during level 5 but also in preparing for Brexit next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>I would still maintain that the numbers taking it up are very small.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#D01500","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I might come in on a second round but I will ask a couple of questions first.  One of the issues that concerns me is that we design now in the interventions that we put in that we will have a sustainable recovery pattern as we come out of this in order to create a recovery.  To what extent is the Department embedding repositioning for structural changes in the instruments it is offering?  I am thinking of climate change, the digital transformation, the change in work patterns and the decline in the use of cash.  I know there are some online instruments, but there is a deeper form of change going on here that will impact on a lot of sectors.  I wonder if the Department is having a good look at that and perhaps structuring in audits to some of its supports so that there is a requirement at least that enterprises would audit some of their weaknesses in these areas.  While it might not be immediate for them to find cash to solve them, at least it would put them on the radar.<\/p> <p>  In the estimation of the witnesses, how many enterprises are likely to require restructuring as we come out of this period in terms of the restructuring of their debt and rental leases?  What is the progress on a lighter form of examinership than the very expensive High Court approach?<\/p><p>I fear that quite a number of enterprises may need that sort of restructuring and we may not have the instruments to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#D01600","nonspeaker":"Deputy Richard  Bruton","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":28,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  I would like to make a couple on points on the design of interventions.  The enterprise base came into this crisis at the end of last year and the early part of this year in quite a strong position.  It had come through the last crisis.  I refer also to the internationalisation of the enterprise base and the strength of the domestic economy.  That helped with some of the early adjustments.  However, there is no doubt that the last six months have seen an acceleration of some of the significant disruptors the Deputy has mentioned, namely, digitalisation, the impact of climate change, remote working and changing patterns in the use of cash and other payment forms.  That has applied across all sectors.  Sectors in which we were not getting traction, which had significant difficulty with the transformation of their businesses, have gone on that journey in the last six months.  I am particularly thinking of the domestic service economy's uptake of digitalisation.  There have been almost 9,000 applicants for the trading online voucher, which is offered by the local enterprise offices, in the last six months.  That is almost equivalent to the previous five years' worth of applications and awards.  The significance of that is not limited to funding.  The scheme requires enterprises to go through a formal process, including a web seminar, to make sure they have a structured programme in place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Can the Department do the same for climate action?

If I may finish my point about retail, our online retail scheme, which has undergone two pilots in 2018 and 2019, has been accelerated again this year.  We had 380 applicants for &euro;5 million in funding in July.  We will announce another award at the end of this year.  As members will see, further funding has been allocated for next year.<\/p> <p>  There is a similar picture on the climate side.  Businesses have seen some of the things they can do.  Remote working certainly helps to reduce travel time to work and increases productivity in many ways.  Just this year we have collaborated with the local enterprise offices to launch a new green enterprise voucher to get businesses to take the first step.  That will include carrying out audits and assessments to show where businesses can reduce waste, increase efficiencies or improve their energy use.  The first steps in a green transition are auditing, assessment and planning.  The next step is ensuring that we have the funding instruments to help businesses on that journey.  As the Deputy will be aware, we already have supports and schemes to assist start-ups in the green economy and to respond to climate change.  We offer support for the commercialisation of technology emerging from the research system and for collaboration with the research sector.  One example is the Dairy Processing Technology Centre, which is a collaboration between dairy companies, Science Foundation Ireland research centres and small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Its objective is to reduce the carbon footprint of operations within factories.  Some 20% of the dairy sector's carbon emissions come from within the factory gates.  This initiative aims to reduce that.  Some &euro;10 million has been allocated in the July stimulus for further initiatives in support of the green economy and to help businesses with audits and with transformations.  <\/p> <p>  This is not limited to new initiatives.  Much of the funding which goes to businesses is now linked to environmental aid, which is allowable under EU state aid rules.  That allows us to support investment.  For example we would not necessarily support the replacement of existing equipment which is not as energy-efficient as the best available technologies.  There is a role for the State in incentivising that investment.  Members will also be aware that budget 2021 made improvements to the accelerated capital allowance for more energy-efficient equipment.  Our policy is a combination of carrots and sticks.  Businesses see the problem in terms of the market, including carbon taxes and international market demand for firms to have green credentials and be part of the circular economy.  Several businesses in the recycling sector have signed up to a new responsible recycling, R2, standard.  This has now been accredited by the National Standards Authority of Ireland, which is one of our agencies.  It certifies businesses as having a fully compliant supply chain, which opens up new markets for those businesses. <\/p> <p>  Surveys from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that between 1% and 2% of businesses have ceased trading in the past five or six months for various reasons.  They were not resilient at the beginning of the crisis.  We also know from the CSO that turnover for between 8% and 10% of businesses did not meet operating costs at the end of August.  That group is vulnerable, but many of those businesses are viable in the medium to long term.  Supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and the restart grant plus have been providing direct support for those businesses and sustaining them.  I note that the Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme has now been extended through next year.  The key concern in offering this support is helping those enterprises to pivot, develop new business plans and find new opportunities.  Some will need to go through the examinership process.  The Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Heather Humphreys, wrote to the Company Law Review Group and progress has been made on an improved examinership process.  We are expecting good progress on that. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":31,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming here this morning and giving a very interesting and timely presentation.

Can the witnesses say when the new call for applications will be made?  Has any analysis of the trading online voucher been carried out?  What kinds of businesses has it served and how successful has it been?  Does it need to be tweaked in any way?  Are the witnesses satisfied that businesses are aware of its existence?  I ask the witnesses to pass my thanks to those managing the call centres.  Several companies that have contacted me were not aware of this initiative.  I told them about it, they made contact and the outcomes have been very positive.  One company managed to hold onto all of its employees because of the assistance and information it received.  Those managing the company were not aware of this possibility until I told them about it.  Perhaps something should be done about that. <\/p> <p>  There is a lot of talk about buying Irish at the moment.  What can be done to encourage people, and particularly State agencies and Government Departments, to purchase Irish products?  Last night I got a report from one company that had been doing business with a certain State agency.  The company has now been told that the agency has decided to purchase abroad and leave it in the lurch.  I can provide more details on that if the witnesses want.  I am anxious to encourage our own agencies to buy Irish.  I know that there are procurement issues. <\/p> <p>  A lot of company assessments were carried out from July to September, especially for the purposes of the employment wage subsidy scheme.  We have now entered a new phase of lockdown.  Companies did well when they opened up in July, August and September.  They now find they are locked down again.  Are there any plans to change the schemes to take account of what will happen in the next weeks or months?  It has been suggested that we should analyse the period from October to next March rather than from July to December 2020.<\/p><p>I think that is it.

I thank the Deputy for his feedback.  This action was taken immediately when the pandemic hit.  Business supports were rolled out to put the call centre in place.  We did not previously have such a facility in the Department.  We have doing much to promote it through social media and other channels.  We have decided to make it a permanent fixture in the Department to provide information to companies about supports provided by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and other Departments.  It will remain a permanent fixture of the Department.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the IDA Ireland regional property programme and the additional &euro;10 million allocated for it, regional development remains a top priority for the Department and for IDA Ireland.  That is why we continue to fund the agency's regional property programme.  A key premise of the programme is that it encourages and facilitates regional investment by ensuring suitable properties are in place to meet the needs of multinational firms.  My Department has allocated &euro;52 million to the IDA Ireland property programme in 2021.  This compares to an allocation of &euro;16 million in 2015.  This increase in the authority's capital budget for property reflects the continuing priority we attach to job creation and economic growth, particularly in the regions.  The impact of the regional property programme is reflected in the transformative nature of some of the key investments secured in the regions.  Through this programme, more than &euro;100 million in capital investment and over 1,000 high-quality jobs have been secured for towns and cities such as Waterford, Athlone, Castlebar, Limerick, Sligo and Tralee.  I will pass over to Mr. Hughes to answer the other questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Pauline Mulligan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>On the matter of online retail, there are two parts to our approach.  We have a general scheme of trading online vouchers which we operate with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  Introductory vouchers of &euro;2,500 are provided for all businesses, right across the board.  As I said, during the early stages of the pandemic, such vouchers were provided to everything from takeaways to restaurants, professional services companies, manufacturers and software firms that trade internationally.  We also increased that.  A number of businesses may have got their first voucher in previous years but we changed the regime so they could get a second voucher to increase sophistication.  I would like to get the message out that any business that got a voucher in the first six months and which may have implemented its plan is encouraged to come back for a step up as such businesses may need to put new systems in place with regard to customs relationship management.  That scheme operates right across the board.<\/p> <p>  The online retail scheme is another step up.  It is specifically aimed at the retail sector, which has been broadly defined, to help improve firms' sophistication.  In some cases, firms may need to hire a studio and invest in photography to demonstrate their activities or to expand the range on offer.  I can think of some examples.  When the T&aacute;naiste launched the list of the 183 successful applicants under the scheme, he did so in a fashion retailer in central Dublin which operates five or six stores and which had never traded online previously.  We also have the example of pharmacists, some of whom who have one or two premises will say that they now have a third shop which operates 24 hours.  While they are sleeping, money is coming in.  These are real examples.  With regard to traditional business, I can think of a marine supplier who has engaged in the scheme.  The scheme operates across the board and up to &euro;40,000 is available to businesses under it.  <\/p> <p>  We reduced the internationalisation criteria for the scheme as part of the call during the summer.  It was previously very focused on helping companies to serve the domestic market while internationalising.  We see that serving the domestic market is very important in its own right and we wish to help businesses with the transition towards an online presence, which I mentioned earlier.  We have just closed-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Hughes but we will have to move on to Deputy Shanahan as the time has run out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#F00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses.  I hope that, as the work of this committee progresses, we will get more opportunities to speak to the Department.  We will not have time to get through very much this morning.<\/p> <p>  I will highlight a couple of issues.  The Department's submission is welcome, as is the funding mentioned within, but there is an obvious bias towards larger businesses in Ireland and foreign direct investment.  A simple case in point is the &euro;5 million provided for microfinance.  This is totally inadequate for the needs of small business.  It is not an easy process for businesses to go through.  The smaller businesses within the SME sector probably employ 600,000 to 700,000.  These are largely owner-operated businesses.  Although the supports the Department representatives are speaking about are welcome, they are very hard for these business people to access.  As someone who has spent time around the enterprise sector, I know that all these strictures have to be looked at with regard to those running smaller businesses who are writing applications and trying to get through the funding process.  Mom-and-pop businesses do not have the bandwidth to find people to do these applications.  I know the local enterprise offices supply consultants but we are talking about trying to support businesses at the earliest stage.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanton already mentioned the early online voucher, which was very welcome.  The Department will have seen the take-up.  The funding has, however, stopped.  That needs to be restored as a priority.  People need to be able to access this scheme very simply and very easily.  They also need to have their hands held.  Going online is a strategic decision but once that decision is made, it must be followed up.  Many businesses are left with a website but need ongoing support in generating business online.<\/p> <p>  I will also refer to the first and second restart grants.  When the second grant was announced, the application dates for the first grant were moved forward.  This meant that the deadline had passed for people who were going to apply for the first grant before their applications were considered.  They were therefore not able to avail of these grants.  It was rather devious on the part of the Department to make an announcement of two tranches of funding when it was obvious that many people were only going to able to avail of one.  I hope we will not see this being done again.  In the main, the facilitation of applications is really important from the point of local enterprise offices and businesses.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Brexit readiness supports, I know these are mainly for exporting companies but they are also for companies which have to bring in supplies from outside of Ireland.  We need to be aware of the difficulties they will face.  We need to do much more in that regard.  I will not ask the representatives any questions today.  I would rather engage with them indirectly or at a point in the future to go through a large number of issues affecting the SME community which need to be addressed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#F00500","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  To be very clear, the allocation for trading online vouchers this year was initially &euro;2.3 million.  This allocation has been exhausted and then increased on two or three occasions already this year and is now more than &euro;20 million.  It has been stepped up quite significantly.  In fairness to the local enterprise offices, 9,396 applications have now been approved and paid out.  This is five years' worth of applications in the space of five months.  Together with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, we have provided significant additional funding for that scheme throughout the year.  The Deputy's point on engagement was absolutely correct.  With regard to business continuity vouchers, some 12,000 have been allocated in the space of five months.  In fairness, there has been very significant stretch work by everybody involved.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the restart grant, 100,000 applications have been received and more than &euro;450 million has been paid out, including &euro;40 million in the last week.  These applications are being dealt with very quickly.  The first restart grant was, as the Deputy may recall, very limited.  There was a minimum payment of &euro;2,000 and it only applied to companies with up to 50 employees.  We then significantly reformed the grant and the T&aacute;naiste launched the significantly improved scheme which was open to businesses of up to 250 employees with a minimum payment of &euro;4,000.  There has been a number of sequential increases or top-ups over recent months as other parts of the country have closed down.  The local authorities have kept the first restart grant scheme open for any business that did not apply in time.  Such businesses can go to the local authority, which is dealing with those grants.  There is a system and process in place for dealing with such companies.  The funding is there for them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Microfinance Ireland, MFI, under the original legislation it could lend &euro;35 million.  It worked incredibly hard to get &euro;20 million in additional lending out and exhausted that ceiling.  We then put in place additional legislation to increase its lending ceiling to &euro;105 million.<\/p><p>Additional funding was provided as part of the Revised Estimates earlier this year in order that it could meet that lending.  Government money will go in as equity for the future and then MFI will be able to borrow on the market.  Its parent previously was the Social Finance Foundation and it had exhausted what it could support.  The SBCI will be borrowing on market for MFI at low or near to zero interest rates and the Exchequer funding goes in as equity for that.  We have no capacity constraint on the funding that is available for MFI.  There is up to &euro;100 million available.  It is considering new products and we will shortly be bringing out additional products.  It has a very quick turnaround as well.  It has also had to deal with significant additional demand.  Its run rate was &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million a year.  It did &euro;20 million in five months and it stands ready to meet anticipated additional demand in the coming months.  I am happy to engage further with the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Following Deputy Shanahan, the next member is Deputy Bruton.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Do we have a very tight time limit?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>It is a five-minute slot again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00400","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I am asking in terms of the overall session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00500","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":43,"content":"<p>We have 55 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00600","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":44,"content":"<p>That is not too bad.  To some extent I am revisiting some of the issues I raised.  Specifically, we have had very strong agencies like Enterprise Ireland which has been very focused on export-oriented sectors.  Given the structural changes that are happening, do we need to take that type of more developmental approach to other strategic areas of the economy?  With the national economic plan coming up, which is setting our sails for a number of years rather than from day to day as we are surviving at the moment, is the Department looking afresh at the issue of a wider range of companies that would be deemed strategic?  Is it looking afresh at regional policy?  During my time in the Department we launched the regional enterprise strategies.  There is an opportunity in the context of broadband, remote working and climate considerations to reboot and redesign regional strategy to take account of the new realities we have.  Will that be a part of the mix?<\/p> <p>  Senator Garvey shares my interest in the start-up environment.  On the last occasion, 100,000 jobs were created by companies that set up their businesses in the face of the most depressing economic environment between 2010 and 2013 or 2014.  Those 100,000 jobs were extremely important to us.  Do we need to look beyond what I almost regard as an obsession with high-potential start-ups?  They are great if they become the great steers or stags or whatever people say they will become but should we be focused on the more common-or-garden start-ups in food and those operating on a smaller scale?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Hughes is right that we have many potential supports for the climate adaption aspect.  I recall Chris Horn speaking about our innovation strategy many years ago.  He said we launch a lot of boats but what we need is an admiralty.  The Department needs an admiralty in respect of climate adjustment not the admiral number of boats it has launched that are there for people to climb on board if they have the motivation.  It needs to create a more strategic approach to this.  I hope the national economic plan might be the vehicle to start that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00700","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for those comments.  Certainly all those issues are ones we are currently considering.  In the context of the national economic plan, the T&aacute;naiste and the Government have commenced the development of that process.  As we speak, stakeholder consultation sessions are taking place this morning, for which more than 200 stakeholders have registered to engage virtually.  That is looking afresh right across the economy, as the Deputy said, to build for the medium and longer term.<\/p> <p>  One particular element that is an input into that process is the SME task force which the T&aacute;naiste established about three weeks ago.  It has already had two plenary meetings and formed a series of four subgroups.  They are meeting on the key areas of entrepreneurship; areas of productivity and competitiveness, of which climate change is obviously a part; internationalisation; and collaboration and networks, bringing in the regional dimension.  That is on the back of an OECD report we commissioned and received at the end of last year, which involved a fundamental examination of our supports for SMEs and entrepreneurship in the country.  The report identified a number of key areas we need to focus on, including climate and the green agenda but also the levels of and adoption of digitalisation, which it indicated were behind where they should be for our SME base.  In multinationals we have our productivity levels, our start-up levels and our rates of internationalisation.  The report set clear targets for stepping up all of those in terms of, for example, a doubling of the number of start-ups, which brings me back to that point regarding not only the high-potential start-ups, HPSUs, but start-ups in all parts of the economy.  The Deputy will recall that during the recession we went from having 14,000 start-ups a year to 18,000 or 19,000.  They were across the board, with HPSUs accounting for 150 a year.<\/p> <p>  As to how we support entrepreneurship in all parts of the economy, that is also linked to the regional agenda.  As the Deputy mentioned, as part of the regional action plans, we have &euro;100 million for regional enterprise development funds.  That is funding hubs and enterprise centres around the country.  There is one now in every county which was a target under the Action Plan for Jobs.  We also launched a &euro;15 million Border enterprise development fund to help Border countries to  respond to Brexit.  Entrepreneurship is a key part of that in addition to responding to advanced manufacturing, digitalisation-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":46,"content":"<p>I point that the time allocated for Deputy Burton is up.

If there are answers to them, I ask that they be given in writing following the meeting.  My first question relates to rents for small and medium enterprises.  I particularly refer to small businesses.  Many of them have received forbearance from their landlords and those landlords are to be commended.  Some have not received it, and I guess many have not, judging from the queries I have received.  Has Mr. Hughes a view on whether a fast-tracked arbitration service could be provided for small businesses to engage with landlords to discuss reducing the rent and making rent sustainable to ensure they do not have to close their doors which I am sure is everybody's focus?  The Department has produced a code of conduct but could more be done and should more be done to help businesses with commercial rents?  Has any thought has been given to a fast-track system?  I am not the only person who has been speaking about it.  Has Mr. Hughes a view on how it would work and whether it should be recommended?<\/p> <p>  There was an allocation of an additional &euro;4 million in budget 2021 under the heading of Health and Safety Authority pay.  I understand a significant portion of that will go on pay restoration.  I tabled a parliamentary question on that but the Department did not give me a breakdown on how much will go on pay restoration.  How much will be left to convert for the provision of staff?  Some of that &euro;4 million will go towards pay restoration.  Can Mr. Hughes give me a breakdown on that?  The Minister of State, Deputy Troy, in a press conference, was adamant that it would all be for new staff.  That parliamentary reply indicated that it will not all be to provide for new staff and that some of it will be for pay restoration.  Mr. Hughes might give me the breakdown on that as I do not believe anybody would dispute that we will need additional health and safety inspectors.<\/p> <p>  Regarding remote working, has Mr. Hughes a position on the right of workers to disconnect?  That has been much talk about the physical implications of Covid but the mental implications of it are major.  People who are working from home tend to be always at work.  I am sure many people in this room have had the experience of working at home.  It has many advantages but it also has disadvantages, in particular for people's mental health when they do not have the right to disconnect.

I thank them for coming in.  I have just a few short questions.  Like Deputy Stanton, I would like to hear specifically about the promotion of Irish businesses in terms of whether there is a PR plan in place rather than the supports that are being given in the background.  There should be something at the moment to assist Irish companies with procurement, as part of the marketing scheme.  Perhaps that is a legal issue.<\/p> <p>  Has there been any movement towards sustainable indicators for enterprises?  I spoke with the head of the local enterprise office and with John Moran on these issues.  If there is funding, businesses are also encouraged to save money on energy, so they can save money in that way as well.  In other parts of Europe when grants are given, the greener the business, the greater the grant provided.  A sustainable indicator system is used.  I accept we do not currently have such a system but that is something we must move towards if we are serious about climate and saving money for businesses.  There should not just be grants to help businesses reduce energy but also a component that rewards them for doing so as well.  Businesses can vary from those who do not give a damn to those who really care and there should be some kind of indicator in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Does Mr. Hughes have any information or statistics on productivity related to working from home?  I am interested in getting some information on that and to see how the Department can support it.  That is something I want to work on more as well.<\/p> <p>  Some 53% of agri-food comes from England, not just through England.  The reason I was late to this meeting is that I was at a meeting with Teagasc this morning.  Much of that is beverages, animal feed and what is called consumer-facing food.  I do not even know what the latter is but I intend to find out.  The percentage is significant.  In terms of promoting enterprise in Ireland, should we promote enterprises that will reduce our dependency on importing 53% of animal feeds, beverages and consumer-facing food?  Will the Department conduct research in the area to see what we can do to reduce it, especially with Brexit and the carbon footprint?<\/p> <p>  Is there a one-stop-shop for small businesses to find out about all the supports?  I constantly find bits and pieces everywhere.  Is it all under one Department's website or is there a one-stop-shop for small business so we can help to let them know about it?<\/p> <p>  People will be queuing now for the winter.  Has the Department thought about a specific provision on awnings outside businesses where people are queuing for takeaways?  The winter will be tough and we are not all great at dressing for the weather, even though we should.  We see beautiful awnings in other countries in Europe that have a similar rainfall and probably worse snow than us and they got subsidised for them.  That is something simple.<\/p> <p>  I wish to ask briefly about businesses which do not have products for sale online.  I worked with John Moran, STRIPE and others on a Lean on Me campaign.  I do not know if Mr. Hughes heard about that.  We did it for businesses that do not normally have products one can sell online, such as restaurants, bars and hairdressers where one can avail of buy-it-forward vouchers to give them hope.  It worked amazingly well.  It was more about hope than the quantity of money they got.  That is different from people who can sell clothes or earrings and other such things online.  Lean on Me was done on a voluntary basis.  We all invested our own time and money in it and the money did not come from the Government.<\/p> <p>  I have further questions but I will stop talking in a moment.  Who is on the task force?  The Department cannot focus on all 17 sustainable development goals.  I think it would be better if we chose a specific few and focused on them.  From working in education I know that we did not ever try to work on all 17.  We would pick three or four to focus on and that may be something the Department could look at.<\/p> <p>  I want to say thanks a million for the money for the remote working hubs.  It was a pre-budget submission I made.  It will be life-changing for small businesses that have no Internet and can now convert old buildings into healthy Wi-Fi hubs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#H01300","speaker":"1659"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":61,"content":"<p>As my time is limited I will race through the questions.  On remote working hubs, we have quantified, with colleagues in the Department of rural affairs and also the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment that there are nearly 1,000.  We have enterprise centres, which are more sophisticated, in the sense that they offer business development programmes, all the way down to libraries that have Wi-Fi.  We want to ensure that everybody has access to a facility where they can remote work but also where they can collaborate and network because that is hugely important for them from a business development perspective and getting start-ups.<br\/><br\/>On the issue of sustainable indicators, one point I would make on it relates to the procurement side.  We now have guidance on green procurement.  That will be a challenge for many businesses but it will also provide significant opportunities.  If a company can get its green credentials in terms of demonstrating energy efficiency and in waste management and responding to green opportunities, for example, with sustainability across all of the sustainable development goals, that will help to position it, in particular for Irish-based businesses on the procurement side.<br\/><br\/>A question on procurement came up earlier.  I am on the interim board of the Office of Government Procurement and it has a dedicated SME advisory group, which meets three or four times a year and it continually engages with SME representative bodies such as Chambers Ireland, ISME and the Small Firms Association, SFA, among others, to identify blockages or gaps to Irish businesses.  It is within the context of the EU framework on procurement but many initiatives have been taken and many things can be done.  The majority of businesses participating in public procurement are SMEs but it is not necessarily the same in terms of the actual value.  We want to increase that participation.  The LEOs, Chambers Ireland, InterTradeIreland and others do work on helping businesses to navigate through the procurement system.<br\/><br\/>In terms of a one-stop-shop, Senator Garvey mentioned LEOs and I want to emphasise again that the LEOs in every county are the first-stop-shop.  What they found in the recent crisis is that so many businesses had come to them that they had not previously dealt with, so they work right across all sectors in terms of that first piece of advice.  We have a website, <i>supportingsmes.ie<\/i>, and a business can put in its size, scale and location and get direct contacts to businesses to whom they should be talking.<br\/><br\/>In terms of awnings and other facilities, some of that is a local planning issue.  A lot of initiatives that can be taken are being taken by local authorities and we would encourage them to be as flexible as possible, which many of them have been.  We have seen in many cases that the funding available through the restart grant has helped businesses to invest in PPE as well as site facilities.  It is a case of working with the local authorities on the public realm.  We would welcome those initiatives.<br\/><br\/>I will mention a couple of points on the general promotion of Ireland.  We heard this morning about the new guaranteed Irish campaign on guaranteed Irish gifts.  The Design and Crafts Council of Ireland launched a Made Local campaign a few weeks ago.  That is about Irish design and craft and giving the designers and small businesses a platform where businesses can access them.  We also have a brochure which has gone out to all the embassies and overseas offices which shows the type of giftware that is available.<\/p><p>There is a really good promotion happening through Design &amp;amp; Crafts Council Ireland.  In terms of retail, one of the big initiatives, which the Minister of State, Deputy English, will be leading in the coming weeks, is about shopping early and shopping local for Christmas, so that we do not have queues in the last week for collection.  Members may have seen some of that.  It attempts to put a spotlight on and give a platform to Irish businesses.  We are very happy to work with business groups to promote local goods and services.  I will come back to the Senator with statistics on productivity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2020102100002#H01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Declan Hughes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I think we have some time because I was the next speaker anyway and I got Deputy Duffy's time.

Businesses are getting significant time efficiencies and savings due to people not travelling and not being stuck in queues, but one does lose on the other side.  We can come back on that.<\/p> <p>  Some of this also relates to an earlier question Deputy Stanton asked about trading online vouchers.  Businesses that have gone online have increased their sales and increased their employment, but their sales increased faster than their employment increased, so they are getting productivity increases by making better use of their facilities.  I referred to the chemist who now has three shops but the capital investment is only in two.<\/p> <p>  I will make two points about the agri-food sector.  That is a continuing focus for both Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia.  As the Senator is aware, Bord Bia is the national food promotion agency and works with businesses, in particular in the retail sector, to ensure that small start-ups, which Deputy Bruton talked about, have access to supply chains and into the large retailers.  Many of those are working very successfully.  Members will have heard of initiatives such as Food Works, which is operated in conjunction with Teagasc, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland.  That has helped about 50 small businesses by teaming them up with retailers to give them access.  Some of the brands we have seen in the past five or ten years, for example in the soup area, started on that journey through that type of import substitution route.<\/p> <p>  There is further potential for that, in particular in the context of Brexit, where we have gone through a very detailed assessment of products and commodities that are imported.  In some cases they are major brands and they are manufactured in either Great Britain or on the Continent and we substitute them.  There was a time when nearly all, between 90% and 95%, of our biscuits were imported.  East Coast Bakehouse in Drogheda was established just before Brexit came on the horizon in 2015 or 2016.  The business was supported by Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland and it identified an opportunity to bring a premium product to the market and it is trading very successfully not just in Ireland but internationally as well.  There is a focus on start-ups and early-stage food companies and giving them reference sites in Ireland with a quality product that has good provenance, and then it has a foothold to bring it to the European market as well.  I am happy to follow up with any other points the Senator wishes.<\/p> <p>  In terms of vouchers, we are very open to a range of such initiatives.  I think there is an exemption from benefit-in-kind, but I will come back to the Senator on that, for companies that reward their employees with vouchers, etc.  Perhaps coming up to Christmas there is an opportunity to do that again.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to Senator Garvey on the members of the task force.

It is now quite clear that the world is warming at a faster rate than anticipated, by about 1oC, while the latest data show the landmass of Europe has warmed by between 1.7oC and 1.9oC.  We are getting close to the point where it will become very difficult to comply with our Paris obligations unless we take really radical reductions in emissions.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes we think of climate change as a thing that is happening outside Ireland, but we know that Ireland is now 0.5oC warmer than it was in the 1960-1990 period.  It is wetter and we are seeing quite a lot of extremes of weather and climate.  I do not need to tell the committee of some of the consequences of flooding, for example, which were evident in Cork this morning.  We saw the stormiest winter for 143 years, the wettest winter over most of Ireland since records began, and relatively unusual behaviour for Atlantic hurricanes, not going from east to west, but from west to east and maintaining hurricane status until getting very close to Ireland.  It is not necessary to reiterate the problems of winter flooding.  Climate science has advanced to the point where we can now attribute many extremes in terms of probability as a consequence of human action rather than something that might have happened naturally.  The data show alarming increases in probability, such as for the French heatwave of 2019, of the order of ten to 100 times more probable.  More recently, heatwaves in Eurasia this summer, where there were extreme temperatures right at the northern tip of Siberia, were about a thousand times more likely as a consequence of human action.  It is important that this Bill tackles effective reductions.<\/p> <p>  I will make some recommendations on the Bill.  As many members will know, I was the rapporteur on the 2015 Bill.  I have watched with some dismay the language that was used there and which was subsequently proven ineffective being repeated in the amended version here.  The first thing that must be tackled is to remove some of those \"have regard tos\" and \"mays\" and make the Bill something that achieves its purpose rather than something that is more designed to be defensive.<\/p><p>The State should achieve that.  It is interesting to note that this morning the Northern Ireland Assembly received submission of a climate Bill which sets a target for decarbonisation of 2045.  Dr. Jackson may go into that in more detail.  We should not tie our policy completely to 2050.  We should have the option of achieving that target earlier, as may happen at European level anyway. <\/p><p> It is important to have interim targets.  I do not subscribe to the belief that they are not needed.  Many Bills include interim targets.  For example, the State is subject to interim targets for its existing 2020 obligations on an annual basis and has been exceeding those targets since 2017.  The Bill should have a glide path with annual figures to indicate whether we are on the right path or trajectory.  If we are not, then corrective action needs to be taken.  It is very important to have a provision similar to that in the equivalent legislation in Scotland, in which annual values are provided.  Interestingly, the Scottish environment minister was criticised because the 2018 reduction of 50% on its 1990 targets did not reflect the 54% which the annual value specified.  It is a discipline which should be stressed.<\/p><p> On carbon budgets, there is a great deal of loose language.  We must make carbon budgets consistent rather than having regard to the matters in section 3 (a) to (d) of the Bill.  It is surprising that section 3, for example, does not mention Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.  The long list from (a) to (y), which one might refer to as alphabet soup, does not refer to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC.  If one wishes to have a Bill that is scientifically rigorous, the IPCC should be mentioned.  I have an issue with the reference to \"having regard to Government policy\".  Government policy is likely to fluctuate through the years.  It is not clear to what the policy relates and whether it relates solely to climate or also to other considerations.  That should be clarified.  One can say with certainty that if it was solely relating to the programme for Government, we know the carbon budget for the next ten years will be approximately 429 million tonnes of CO2..  If that was the only criterion today, the issue then would be how to offload and segregate that into the two five-year periods.  That will be a crucial issue in the coming months as we begin to decide that carbon budget.  It may be that Government policy does not take into account what Ireland's fair share of the remaining carbon budget would be.  There are other considerations.  The more of this loose language there is in the Bill, the less likely one is to achieve the end goal.<\/p><p> I refer to carbon leakage.  I do not know where that came from but it seems very unwise to include carbon leakage because it cuts both ways in terms of its legal definition.  Some countries have ignored the environmental burden of production and exported their products to Ireland or are deemed to wish to so do.  There are other countries that have stricter carbon emission reduction requirements than does Ireland.  That may be the case, for example, in a situation where products being exported from Ireland will be deemed to be leakage from Ireland.  I am thinking in particular of countries such as the Netherlands, where very strict reductions in emissions and its dairy herd are now being considered and production companies are seeking to establish new enterprises in countries such as Ireland.  We must look very closely at that particular leakage phrase.  I do not think it should be included in the Bill.<\/p><p> The issue of biogenic methane is a very complex one on which I may have to revert to the committee because it is not something that can be explained simply.  The traditional and established way of measuring methane reflects its greater potency as a greenhouse gas.  For example, in 20 years it will  produce 86 times as much warming as one tonne of CO2.  The bottom line is that there are slight differences between CO2 and methane in terms of their longevity in the atmosphere.  The half life of methane is approximately ten years.  It is still present in the atmosphere after that and much of it converts to CO2 thereafter.  It is important to realise that the traditional way of measuring it, that is, the 100-year global warming potential, underestimates the potency of methane in shorter time periods.  As a result, alternative methods of recognising those different lifetimes in the atmosphere, such as GWP*, have been suggested.  It is important to emphasise that no matter what method one uses, it becomes clear that any increase in methane emissions will, for Ireland at least, very badly compromise our ability to comply with the Paris Agreement.  In contrast, any significant and sustained reduction in methane will have a greater impact in helping us achieve our Paris Agreement targets than a comparable reduction in CO2.  Methane is a critical gas which must be reduced.  In the case of Ireland, its contribution to warming over the past few decades relative to that of CO2 has been enormous.  All of this must be taken into account in the context that whatever way we wish to measure methane, the reporting requirement is simply established at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, level according to IPCC methodology, and that is the 100-year global warming potential criteria.  When it comes to Ireland reporting, that is the only criteria that applies.  Unless we can change the minds of 197 countries, that is the only way in which our greenhouse gas emissions will be reported in the years to come.  Although it is open to policy makers to measure separate gases such as SF6 or methane and to have separate quantification of them, it is not open to them to start changing the reporting requirements at present.<\/p><p> I refer to the paragraphs of section 6 dealing with overshoot and undershoot.  The section relates to circumstances where the carbon budget is not exceeded and the Minister may, effectively, bank those credits.  I do not think one should be rewarded for achieving such a target.  One should not be rewarded by being entitled to pollute more heavily in the next five-year budget, but that is another issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":112,"content":"<p>The Professor has had ten minutes to make his statement and the committee would appreciate it if he could sum up in the next minute or two.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#B00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":113,"content":"<p>I will  sum up.

I have published recently in the fields of climate law and biodiversity law, including a chapter on the history of Irish climate law that will appear in a forthcoming edited book on national climate Acts.  My previous roles include working for the UK Government&rsquo;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DEFRA, where I provided legal advice, drafted legislation and defended litigation.  I have litigated cases for many years before the Irish, English and EU courts.  Recently, I acted for Friends of the Irish Environment in Climate Case Ireland before the High Court and Supreme Court.  The perspectives I offer on the Bill are, therefore, as an academic, a former drafter of legislation and a litigator.<br\/><br\/>Unfortunately, the Bill is very weak when compared to leading climate laws adopted elsewhere, and when compared to earlier draft laws prepared in this jurisdiction.  That said, the Bill could easily be strengthened.  First, interim targets should be included in the Bill to guide the creation of carbon budgets en route to net zero, consistent with limiting heating to 1.5&deg;C.  The Scottish Act is a useful exemplar here.  A mechanism for modifying the net zero date and the interim targets should also be included, with reference to the need for &quot;progression&quot; and Ireland's &quot;highest possible ambition&quot;, as per the Paris Agreement.  There is, of course, a strong argument that 2050 is already too late for Ireland to reach net zero on the basis of equity. <br\/><br\/>Second, the Bill should include legal obligations requiring the Taoiseach or Minister to ensure that carbon budgets and targets are met, and requiring the Taoiseach or Minister to correct course and compensate if a carbon budget or target is not met.  The Scottish, UK and New Zealand Acts provide useful precedents here, as does the Climate Change Bill produced in 2010 by an all-party predecessor joint committee.  At that time, the Joint Committee on Climate Action and Energy Security proposed placing these legal duties on the Taoiseach.  No such duties exist in the current Bill, and there is equally no obligation to ensure that climate action plans are consistent with adopted carbon budgets.<br\/><br\/>Third, the Bill requires the State to &quot;pursue&quot; but not &quot;achieve&quot; the 2050 climate objective, making the central objective of the Bill weaker than the objectives of the Climate Act 2015, the previous Government&rsquo;s heads of Bill and the joint committee&rsquo;s Bill of 2010.  Also, the reference to an &quot;environmentally sustainable economy&quot; in the objective of the 2015 Act and the 2019 heads of Bill has been dropped and should be reinserted. <br\/><br\/>Fourth, &quot;have regard to&quot; is a weak legal obligation.  The list of matters to which Ministers and the Government must currently &quot;have regard to&quot; in adopting plans, strategies, frameworks and carbon budgets could usefully be split, with the stronger requirement &quot;must be consistent with&quot; applying to certain matters.  Regarding the principle of applying &quot;must be consistent with&quot; obligations to public bodies, see head 15 of the 2019 heads of Bill.  Chief among the matters that public bodies should be required to act consistently with is the first item in section 3(3) of the Bill, that is, the overall objective of the UN framework convention and the temperature limits specified in the Paris Agreement.<br\/><br\/>Fifth, the public participation obligations in the Bill should be strengthened, and the principles of &quot;climate justice&quot; and &quot;just transition&quot; should be fully enshrined in the Bill.  Climate justice remains undefined in the Bill and is undermined by the weak &quot;have regard to&quot; obligation that precedes it.  The principle should be defined and made meaningful; for example, the Government could be required to report on how and the extent to which the principle has been taken into account in setting and reviewing the net-zero target date, interim targets, carbon budgets, plans and so forth.  There is no reference in the Bill to the concept of a just transition, in contrast to Scotland's Act which sets out detailed &quot;just transition principles&quot; and requires the Scottish Government to explain the extent to which its climate plans take account of these principles and the sustainable development goals, SDGs.<br\/><br\/>Sixth, section 4(7) of the Bill should be amended or deleted, to ensure that the effect of the Supreme Court&rsquo;s judgment in Climate Case Ireland is preserved.<br\/><br\/>Seventh, the Climate Change Advisory Council still has <i>ex officio<\/i>members, contrary to the recommendation of a joint committee in 2013.  It is the subject of only a &quot;best endeavours&quot; obligation when it comes to gender equality and could do with additional expertise, including in the fields of law and just transition, and from the perspectives of youth and future generations.<br\/><br\/>Eighth, the Climate Change Advisory Council should be tasked with reporting, at least annually, on whether the current net-zero target date, the interim targets, the long-term strategy, the carbon budget programme and the climate action plan still represent Ireland&rsquo;s &quot;highest possible ambition&quot;.  The Minister should be required to account at least annually to the joint committee on the same question, after receiving the advisory council&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.<br\/><br\/>Finally, the Bill should be amended to ensure that actions to address climate breakdown and biodiversity loss are fully complementary.  For example, the Bill could usefully promote, via the climate Act, nature-based solutions for mitigation and adaptation that enhance biodiversity.<br\/><br\/>While the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly recommended, with 97% support, that an independent body be resourced with functions to include pursuing the State in legal proceedings relating to climate change, the present Bill appears to have been crafted with a view to avoiding legal accountability.  This is counterproductive.  A weak governance framework will not see emissions fall, and falling emissions are the only thing likely to satisfy those who may otherwise turn to litigation.  Further, litigation based on fundamental rights cannot be avoided by adopting a woolly climate law framework.<br\/><br\/>In conclusion, to stand a chance of limiting heating to 1.5&deg;C, our emissions need to fall very deeply and very rapidly, starting immediately.  We have just one shot at getting this legislation right.  We know that robust framework climate laws enable effective action, and we know how such laws are designed.<br\/><br\/>I wish the joint committee every success in its work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Thank you.

What is the best way to ensure that the Bill is going to create a clear and explicit duty on the Government to adopt carbon budgets, which I presume would essentially be in line with the programme for Government?  Second, he spoke about the language being very vague at certain points.  What is the most effective way to put clear legal obligations on a Government, Ministers and relevant bodies in this Bill?<\/p> <p>  Does Professor Sweeney think that under this Bill as drafted it would be possible for the Government to say legally that it is only going to try to hit targets of 1%, 2% or 3% in one year and then massively try to backload the mitigation after 2030 or 2033?  Could that happen under this legislation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#C00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I will take the questions in turn.  The Senator mentioned the programme for Government commitment to reduce emissions by 7% per annum and asked how carbon budgets could be made consistent with that policy aim.  It is an interesting issue and it strikes at an issue at the heart of the Bill.  In principle, the Bill suggests that the Climate Change Advisory Council will be responsible, independently, for proposing carbon budgets.  However, the programme for Government states what the Government plans to do for the next ten years.  The question I would put to the committee is: how do those two things fit together?  We are asking the Climate Change Advisory Council to propose budgets independently, but it knows what the Government wants to do for the next ten years.  As to how one can ensure legally that the budgets are consistent with a science-based reduction trajectory that will help to limit warming to 1.5&deg;C, it is easy to insert strong language in the Bill to that effect, for example, \"must be consistent with\".<\/p> <p>  The second question was about putting duties on Ministers and public bodies.<\/p><p>My central idea here would be to include in section 15 a general obligation on all public bodies and organs of the State to exercise their functions compatibly with the objectives of the UN framework convention and the Paris Agreement.  It could be modelled, for example, on section 3(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, which requires organs of the State to exercise their functions compatibly with the human rights enshrined in that convention.  That would be a very powerful general obligation to impose, and there are other examples in Irish law, such as the context of the habitats directive, where it has also been done.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":120,"content":"<p>The way the Bill is phrased currently, it would be an option for a Minister to backload a carbon budget.  There may be very many reasons, apart from political ones, a Minister would seek to do this.  It may well be, for example, that the State might feel the infrastructure necessary to achieve bigger reductions would take some time to come on stream.  If that is done, to stay within the ten-year carbon budget, it would mean excessive reductions would be required in the next five years.  In some cases that would be almost impossible to achieve without quite major dislocation to the economy.  It would be very advisable for a Minister not to seek to divide the ten-year budget in the context of a very heavy loading down the road.  It would be a very big mistake.<\/p> <p>  There is also the problem of the reporting lag, which the committee has not yet had a chance to consider.  In 2020, we only have results for greenhouse gas emissions for 2018 and we therefore have approximately one year's lag in getting the necessary data.  The Bill provides for the Minister, in setting new carbon budgets, to oscillate the carbon budget figures proposed between the Oireachtas, the Minister and the Government.  It allows for a period of between four and six months.  There is an issue in how we match the achievement of a carbon budget when we will not know whether it has been achieved for perhaps a year and a half after the carbon budget period.<\/p> <p>  It would be unwise, therefore, for Ministers to play with the figures to project a more lenient target in the first five-year budget than would otherwise be demanded by the ten-year period.  This is an area that the Bill should tighten.  It should be possible, for example, for the Environmental Protection Agency to issue a provisional fifth year emissions projection, which would be used in the formulation of the next carbon budget.  This would be essential if we are to avoid the kind of position where we would have a five-year carbon budget that would only be decided two and half years into the carbon budget, for example.  It comes back to the question of making a stab at the first five-year budget as opposed to the second one.  We need seriously to consider how to avoid falling into that trap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":121,"content":"<p>Having held the ministerial brief, I know Professor Sweeney has made a major contribution in this area.  I agree with much of what he says and there is potential to strengthen this Bill.<\/p> <p>  Professor Sweeney favours putting annual targets into the Bill and cites the Scottish example.  The approach in the Bill, as I understand it, is that two carbon budgets will be set and there shall be no facility for changing those.  It creates a rigid constraint.  On the other hand, the Scottish legislation allows Ministers, by regulation, to change those annual targets.  It seems these are two different approaches, with one having annual targets but allowing Ministers to change them, with the other having a five-year budget but not allowing change other than in the event of scientific evidence changing.  Is it necessarily true that the Scottish model is better than the other?<\/p> <p>  It strikes me that the easy part of this is writing down that we will hit this or that number.

Currently, the Bill provides for the first investigation of that to occur in 2023.  If we are going to monitor whether we are on the right track, we need to be much more sensitive than waiting until the end of a five-year budget, which may be immutable but which could be exceeded.<\/p> <p>  I mentioned sections that do not provide any sanction where an immutable five-year budget has been exceeded.  Only 1% of the excess is allowed to be borrowed for remediation and it is not clear from where it will be borrowed, such as the second or third five-year budget.<\/p> <p>  Currently, there are approximately 60 million tonnes of CO2 being emitted per year and there may be a carbon budget of 200 million tonnes of CO2 over a five-year period.

As it stands, the Bill allows 1 million tonnes of CO2 from the total to be borrowed, leaving 99 million tonnes of CO2 that will be quietly forgotten about.  There is no sanction in bringing that forward as a burden on the next carbon budget.<\/p> <p>  What is missing from the Bill is the ability to rectify a carbon budget that has been exceeded.  It is simply not there.  As I indicated, this is an amnesia clause that could wreck the entire purpose of the Bill in the event we exceed that five-year target.  It is another reason that if there is some type of interim checking, we can see whether remedial action needs to be taken in advance of the ending of the five-year budget.  Only then can we ensure we are back on track or not.  This is another reason interim targets are so important.<\/p> <p>  On litigation and remediation, I am not interested in jailing or fining people unnecessarily or putting the Minister in the dock.  I am interested in ensuring the State meets its obligations it has signed up to.

They might make comments in writing on those given I will speak specifically to the legislative detail.<\/p> <p>  Reference was made to the environmentally sustainable economy.  I was interested in the comment on carbon leakage.  It is quite an ambiguous and potentially misleading phrase.  Would the reinclusion of phrases such as \"the environmentally sustainable economy\", which speaks to the economic but also the targets which had been in the 2015 Bill, be a better way of capturing economic issues and providing a reference to the question of non-territorial emissions?  I am concerned about the issue of non-territorial emissions.  A comment was made on how to ensure we do not have a disproportionate use, for example, of either offsetting on the one side or of effectively importing the damage done within the Bill, even where Departments might purchase allocations.  I presume we do not want them to purchase all of those in an offsetting mechanism.<\/p> <p>  The issue of methane is very clear.  It suggests it might be important to put that measurement technique or reporting mechanism, to which we are committed, in the Bill even if we may need to measure methane specifically in the next period of time.  This comes back to the question of interim targets.  I ask both witnesses to comment on how robust the Bill is in ensuring we make the major change we need in the next ten years with respect to all gases, including methane, to be able to achieve the 1.5oC target down the line.<\/p> <p>  Might interim targets be best phrased as five-year and ten-year interim minimum targets as we must allow space that the science might ask us to move further?  Would that be linked to, for example, the EU 55% target?  I know it will have to be stand-alone, but the EU 55% target has been discussed.

I might speak to the latter two with one comment on non-territorial emissions.  It would be useful if, as the UK does now, we started reporting on the basis of consumption emissions as well as purely what is happening with our emissions in terms of their movements up or down and used consumption accounting and reported those emissions alongside.  That is a very useful feature of the UK's reporting.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the robustness of the Bill in ensuring we will achieve reductions in the next ten years, my strong view is that the Bill is not robust at all in achieving that.  I strongly suspect that if the Bill were passed it stands, we would be back here in ten years asking where it all went wrong, how it was possible that we made a second generation climate law that was weaker than first generation laws in other jurisdictions and that did not therefore result in the rapid and deep fall in emissions that were required.  That is down to, among other things, the language used in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  This overlaps with a point Deputy Bruton made about modifying the targets.  The Scottish Act provides for modification.  I argued in my opening statement that we should include something similar.  Essentially, the Scottish Act follows a one-way ratchet, so we have a progression of increased ambition, not reduced ambition.  That is secured in Scotland by a reference to target-setting criteria, including what is the fair and safe Scottish budget, but also there is a limit on reducing ambition because modifying the net zero data and the interim targets can only be done essentially consistent with scientific advice and where the scientific advice states that is permissible and an okay thing to do and still will be consistent with avoiding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I agree with almost everything said there.  In terms of leakage and extraterritorial emissions, these should be handled actively in our negotiations on new trade treaties.  We have not really encapsulated climate considerations fully in, for example, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA.  We would have concerns about the energy charter in terms of how it handles climate considerations.  Most importantly, we must recognise that the EU Green Deal specifically mentions border adjustments.  That is a very useful phrase the Government should pursue with the climate Bill to ensure we do not have some of the problems to which the Senator referred.  The indications are that it will not be pursued as actively as climate people would like, but that is something that should be addressed, although not necessarily in the Bill.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the sustainable economy, that is a very useful phrase to have.  \"Sustainable\" is a word that is much misused, but it conveys a little better the concept than simply using the word \"leakage\".<\/p> <p>  Having interim methane targets would be very useful as a domestic guide but not as something we would be capable of reporting.  Having internal minimum targets is useful, but we must have some form of enforcement or sanction to tackle those.<\/p> <p>  If I may refer to Deputy Bruton's comment on changing communities, communities are already changing.  We have seen this in recent years.  The pressure is coming from young people and the community.  What they are looking for is leadership on this issue.  That leadership is what this Bill should also be about, providing the way ahead to crystallise the ambitions and the objectives which the wider community is increasingly now expressing.<\/p> <p>  In terms of sanctions, we have to change community attitudes.

I will keep my contribution short to give them time to respond.  My first question is for Dr. Jackson.  In his opening statement he referred to amending the Bill to ensure that climate action and biodiversity are fully complementary.  The Bill as it stands refers to biodiversity, but it links it with ecosystem services.  My concern is that the Government has taken a very utilitarian attitude towards biodiversity.  We can see how forestry is being used as a carbon sink but at the sacrifice of Natura.  Has Dr. Jackson thoughts on how we could strengthen that in the Bill?<\/p> <p>  The importance of interim targets was mentioned by previous speakers.  As the Bill is laid out, without those interim targets and the framing of the objective where they sit, we know that it is possible for a Minister to backload carbon emissions.  I would like the witnesses' thoughts on how, in the absence of those interim targets and even if there is not an intention to backload emissions, there is the duty to get back on track if they do not meet their targets, even if they are trying to.  How effective does having interim targets allow for the planning of budgets and that type of trajectory?<\/p><p>I will make brief reference to biogenic methane.

On the positive side, how do we promote nature-based solutions that enhance biodiversity?  Then on the negative side of things, how do we prevent mitigation and adaptation solutions damaging biodiversity?  The second aspect is, to some extent, addressed by instruments outside the framework of the climate legislation, such as our implementation of the EU habitats and birds directives, the Wildlife Acts etc.<\/p> <p>  It would be possible, for example, to add biodiversity to the list of matters to which regard must be had in the context of making plans.  As I argued in my opening statement, however, \"have regard to\" is a very weak obligation and I do not think that does the job.  Looking at international examples, the Scottish legislation requires the Government to have regard to biodiversity, or to take account of biodiversity, in considering revising the targets contained in that Act.  That is one aspect.  It also requires the Government to explain the account it has taken of the SDGs when making plans.  The SDGs, of course, would bring in various biodiversity relevant goals.<\/p> <p>  My central idea here, however, to strengthen the Bill regarding biodiversity and to include something meaningful would be to look at section 15 and the general duties imposed upon public bodies.  What we really want in respect of positive aspects in this context is to encourage, promote and give precedence to nature-based solutions that enhance biodiversity.  Enhancing biodiversity is key, because as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, IPBES, the biodiversity equivalent of the IPCC, has commented, not all so-called nature-based solutions enhance biodiversity, and some will even damage biodiversity.<\/p> <p>  In section 15, therefore, we could usefully look at imposing a general duty in the form, for example, along the lines \"that public bodies must exercise their functions compatibly with a goal protecting, conserving and enhancing biodiversity, including by way of promoting nature-based solutions to mitigation and adaptation that enhance biodiversity\".  We could of course look at the specific language to be used, but that would be another powerful general obligation that would require public bodies to think about this every time they exercise their functions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>There is not much I can add.

We do not need to go into a long catalogue of things, because what we need to see is that the Government, or the Minister at the time, is considering the critical aspect of climate change in this regard and also taking into consideration any aspect which might adversely impact on biodiversity.

The phrase \"one or more greenhouse gases\" is contained in the Bill.  I ask the witnesses to comment on how to strengthen that carbon budget section.  I also ask Professor Sweeney to mention black carbon and whether he believes that could be brought into the Bill.  Reference is made to a nitrogen balance sheet in the Scottish legislation, for instance, and I wonder if we could look at something like that.<\/p> <p>  Turning to climate justice, it is not very clear what that is in the section on definitions.  The Scottish legislation refers to the concept, and uses the phrase \"support the people who are most affected by climate change but who have done the least to cause it and are the least equipped to adapt to its effects\".  That is not the Mary Robinson phrase.  Do the witnesses think that phrase is adequate and takes into consideration the intergenerational impacts of climate justice?

We cannot get around that.<br\/><br\/>I agree completely regarding the issue of nitrogen balance.  It is interesting that the Bill in Northern Ireland, which was submitted this morning, makes a great deal out of the importance of nitrogen in this area.  We do not seem to have grasped that fact in this Bill.  In many ways, how much nitrogen we import and put on our lands is the key to how well we will cope with methane emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions emanating from land use.  The Senator is quite correct in emphasising that aspect.<br\/><br\/>Climate justice is one of these things which is difficult to define, but I think the State has certainly not been particularly generous towards the Green Climate Fund, for example, in the last decade.  There have been modest increases, but we are still an order of magnitude less in respect of our contributions to that fund compared with some of the more generous countries, some of which have much lower GDP <i>per capita<\/i>than us.  We have international obligations, therefore, with which we could achieve better results and achieve much more in the context of contributions to climate justice as well.

I would stress that if we want to - and we must - progress beyond that position, we really must define climate justice and make obligations relating to it meaningful in the Bill.  One way to do that, beyond defining climate justice and imposing obligations around it, would be to put the concept from Article 4 of the Paris Agreement of progression beyond previous ambition and the highest possible ambition, into the heart of the Bill.  We could, for example, have a modification possibility so that we could adjust the net zero date and the interim targets with reference to the need to progress beyond the previous position and to strive for the highest possible ambition.

I was going to raise many of the issues raised by Senator Boylan regarding nature-based solutions and how we ensure the implementation of such solutions do not have adverse biodiversity impacts.  How do we get that balance right?  We can plant a whole stand of trees or even a forest but if it is on the wrong site, it will have negative biodiversity impacts.

In terms of nature-based solutions, we have to be very cautious about how we achieve them.  We must not see the apparently simple solution of planting trees as a way out of our problems because we know that we are probably going to be cutting down more trees than planting them for the next decade or so which means our sequestration is quite limited.  In addition, when one plants a new forest, it may take a number of years before the disturbance of the soil caused by planting and the respiration and CO&sup2; losses that have occurred are made up by sequestration.  We must have a very careful and cautious accounting system in place.  Equally, we must also ensure that we have, for example, afforestation that is going to achieve sequestration and that is not often the case if we cut down and burn a forest or burn the wood from a forest before it reaches a reasonable level of maturity.  We are talking about carbon dioxide which lasts for 100 years in the atmosphere.  If we are going to sequester, we need to ensure that the products that we produce have a longevity which actually balances the warming effect the gas achieves over that very long period.  Therefore, we must be very cautious.  We are going to have to look very closely at international accounting standards from the IPCC in order to ensure that we do not go down the road of maladaptation as a result of malsequestration.<\/p> <p>  In terms of voting on the council, I have the highest regard for the three institutions that are mentioned in the Bill as being on the Climate Change Advisory Council.  However, I feel that their role should be advisory rather than as an integral part of the council with full voting rights.  This is especially important as the council has a membership of 11 or 12 people so it represents a considerable block which could mitigate against the views of the nine independent members on the council.  I would agree with Deputy Whitmore's point about gender balance.  At the moment two of the director generals referred to out of the three are male and I would hope that the council would be better balanced from both a gender and a scientific perspective.  We have seen some of the imbalances that have occurred in the current council.  They are all excellent people but they tend to be much more economically inclined rather than having a strong scientific background.  It is the desire of this Bill that this should be rebalanced.<\/p> <p>  Finally, in terms of the ranking of the Bill, at the moment it would be in the relegation zone of the league table but if we get this Bill right it would place Ireland among the leaders in terms of climate change litigation.

We start from a low base because the 2015 Act has been described in the academic literature as \"symbolic\" legislation and the proof is in our emissions.  Our emissions have continued to rise and we are going to be about 10% above the 1990 level by the end of this year.  One can contrast that with countries that have strong framework laws like the UK which has reduced its emissions by about 40% over the same period and Scotland which has achieved a 50% reduction over the same period.<\/p> <p>  I do not get any sense of emergency from this Bill.  The D&aacute;il has declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and we can really strengthen this Bill if we give instructions to drafting lawyers to emulate international best practice to produce a Bill that reflects the emergency nature of the situation that we are in.  I mentioned in my opening statement the idea of getting the advisory council to regularly review and comment on whether what we are doing represents our highest possible ambition.  In the Netherlands, they are looking at the same idea but while I suggest that it should be done at least annually, in the Netherlands there are discussions around monthly reporting and feedback in response to the question of whether what the Netherlands is doing is its highest possible ambition.  That is being debated in the Netherlands at the moment and that is appropriate in the context of an emergency.  <\/p> <p>  The forestry question is a really interesting and good one.  In terms of how to deal with potentially negative impacts on or damage to biodiversity as a result of mitigation and adaptation, I am not sure we find a great example of that within a framework climate law.

There are 25 items in total which the Government must be consistent with or have regard to, whichever language ends up being adopted.  I hope it is the stronger formulation.  This effectively makes them all equal.  Could they cancel each other out?  If there is no pecking order attached to the need to \"have regard to\" various items, does this essentially mean we may as well have complete disregard for the actions that are needed?  I would like to ask Professor Sweeney what concerns he thinks we should be determined to have regard to.  He mentioned the IPCC report.  I would have thought the Bill should contain strong language requiring the Government to have regard to the levels of carbon in the atmosphere, which is currently rated at 350 parts per million.  Should that be included in the Bill?  Moreover, is there a role anywhere in this legislation for concrete measures concerning the importation of liquid natural gas, LNG, data centres, fossil fuel infrastructure or the role of the State in harvesting renewable energies?<\/p> <p>  The fourth observation in Professor Sweeney's submission concerns carbon leakage and states that \"unilateral action by Ireland is irrelevant in this context since emissions are only counted at national level\".  He also refers to trade law and border adjustments at EU level.  Does that mean that if we export live cattle or processed meat products and do not count the associated emissions, they are counted at some other level and put back on our shoulders?<\/p> <p>  Professor Sweeney also noted that firms from countries with stricter climate laws than Ireland's are seeking to locate here, where environmental obligations are less onerous.

There are a few key issues that we should have regard to.  They relate to the science and our international obligations.  I would whittle them down to two, namely, requirements under the UNFCCC, and the annual IPCC assessment reports.  They are the two gold standards that affect us.  We could almost eliminate the rest as serious considerations, although I would obviously expect the Bill to make some reference to climate justice, just transition etc. as well.<\/p> <p>  Regarding concrete actions, the Bill could certainly make a statement on the necessity not to build new infrastructure or engage in other activities which might work against the Bill's end goal of carbon neutrality.  That would certainly strengthen the Bill considerably and address some of the issues the Deputy has raised.  It might give the Government some grounds for acting wisely in this way.<\/p> <p>  Regarding carbon leakage, we only measure emissions which take place on the island of Ireland.  In the case of live cattle, only the emissions which take place on the island of Ireland are measured.  I do not believe we measure the emissions of cattle in lairage or once they leave the island.  They are certainly not measured on board any cattle transporters because shipping is not yet subject to the Paris Agreement's quota requirements.<\/p> <p>  There are countries with stricter climate laws.  I was particularly thinking of the Netherlands, where as a result of litigation the Government has had to undertake quite serious reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, almost on an emergency basis.  This has led to changes in agriculture being imposed there.  Cheese manufacturers, for example, have been unable to expand in the Netherlands and have sought other countries in which to build cheese factories.  If a firm is looking for a country with a ready supply of milk on which its environmental burden can be imposed without the same legislative requirements, I am afraid Ireland comes to mind.

It has eroded more in that short period than it has over the course of my lifetime.  Any time there is a southerly wind and high tide the erosion worsens.  That is a visual representation of climate change happening before our eyes.  Also, any time there is a southerly wind and high tide, our towns are exposed to flooding.

The more we can do about it in the short and medium term the better.<\/p> <p>  What I was referring to in terms of sanctions was that the Bill has no real accountability.  Nothing in the Bill provides that when the carbon budget is exceeded, the Minister or the Government will have to do remedial action or will bear any responsibility.  Ministers, on average, may be in office for two to three years.  Governments may be in office for four or five years but this is a long-term issue where we need some guidance in terms of accountability to be built into the Bill.  I suggested it might be worth considering a provision that if a Department exceeds its sectoral budget, it will be forced to suffer some financial penalty in terms of its budgetary expenditure and that might be the necessity to buy carbon quota.  It is only one of many suggestions.  It could be that the Minister for Finance would penalise it by the same amount relative to its ongoing budget.  We need some accountability to be built into the Bill.  In the case of a carbon budget being exceeded, there is no real accountability to take the next carbon budget and reduce it by a corresponding amount.  There is no accountability on the part of a Minister who may only be in office for a few months to take the hard decisions necessary to ensure we do not go further into the red in the next five years.  That is important.  I am not being drastic about it but there must be an incentive for Departments.  As we know, Departments can be mini empires on their own and it can be hard to bang heads together between different Departments, which is why I have always argued the Department of the Taoiseach should have a role in changing that.  We need to have something to make accountability important in this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>Does Dr. Jackson have a comment to make on the issue of sanctions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#J00800","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":166,"content":"<p>Briefly, I recommend going back to the joint committee's heads of the Bill of 2009 and full text of the Bill of 2010.

The 2009 heads of Bill examined the idea of financial penalties and incentives, and proposed financial penalties for public bodies and also for private sector operators that did not achieve targets.  By the time the full text of the Bill came out in 2010, there had been a movement away from the idea of financial penalties towards incentives.  That is something that is worth considering.  It is a type of carrot-and-stick approach.  There could be a budget as an incentive for Departments to achieve their targets and if they achieve their targets they could get an additional budget.

Perhaps they might mention what needs to be expanded in terms of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, because of the narrow grouping.<\/p> <p>  As I am conscious of the time perhaps we could have a response to the following in writing.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith made the point that the same language should not be used for everything and, therefore, it would be useful if the speakers could comment.  Some of the phrases used are, \"the Bill should be consistent with\".  Are there other phrases for some things that the Bill should be informed by?  For some things the phrase \"have regard to\" might be the appropriate phrase.  Another crucial phrase is \"the Bill should not be in contradiction to\".  I would appreciate language suggestions for the idea that the national infrastructure \"should not be in contradiction to\".  I ask the witnesses to suggest, in their written response, the language to use in the Bill and where.  Perhaps section 3 should be divided into a couple of different sections with one dealing with the hard target piece and another with the interim 2030 targets, if they were to be included.  Another section might deal with the sectoral targets or other areas.  I think there needs to be a differentiation in the language.

The long-term strategy is also a requirement of the EU at the moment.  We had to submit a long-term climate strategy, in theory, by the end of 2018, and we managed it in early 2019.  I think that will be tightened up over time but we should at least pay some comment in the Bill to the fact that we have a long-term strategy of decarbonisation.<\/p> <p>   It is important for us to address what we mean by carbon neutrality and how to achieve same.  I do not want us to achieve it in the last five years.  I want us to be on a trajectory that gives confidence in the next 30 years that we are on that pathway.  So, a long-term strategy would be useful.<\/p> <p>  A Bill should be justiciable.  Citizens have a right to hold the Government to account if it is not achieving what the electorate wished it to achieve in establishing this Bill, for example.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Higgins, Article 4 of the Paris Agreement would be a much more powerful inclusion than Article 2.  As she mentioned, language is vital.  As we discussed this morning, the phrase \"not in contradiction to\" would be very useful but I shall leave commentary to my legal friend who is probably much better at explaining that than me. <\/p> <p>  In terms of the question on underachievement, that is probably the only place in the Bill where the word \"may\" might be valuable, where the Minister should have discretion to not carry over the benefits of underachievement to the next carbon budget.  Indeed, that is a fairly unlikely situation to happen given the way the international trend is towards getting even more tight carbon budgets as time goes on.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Devlin asked for the differences with the UK Act.  The key difference is the obligation to correct or carry overshoots into the next carbon budget and plan for the carbon budget on that basis.  Also, the other key aspect is that the UK Climate Change Committee has a very powerful role in influencing infrastructural developments, which was mentioned by Senator Higgins.  We must climate change proof many aspects of Irish society and this Bill should give the power to do that in a way that has happened in other jurisdictions.  <\/p> <p>  For achieved targets, we pat ourselves on the back certainly, as we have said.  We also recognise that the next generation will have to face difficult times and we should not simply bank the benefits of achieved targets.

We are in a vacuum period now where we have no plan with that horizon.  There is a need for a new mitigation plan and-or long-term strategy.  How long is it going to take to pass this legislation and have the concept of a long-term strategy?  Clearly, a legal vacuum exists.  There has to be a plan, under the 2015 Act, and there is not one at the moment.<\/p> <p>  As I said in my opening statement, I am concerned about section 4(7).  Section 4(6) of the Act replicates the language on the basis of which Friends of the Irish Environment was successful in the Supreme Court.  One needs to specify the manner in which it is proposed to achieve the 2050 objective.  That is then supplemented by section 4(7) of the Bill, of which I have serious concerns about its impact.  Could it be said, if a long-term strategy was challenged relying on the Supreme Court's judgment, that the law has moved on?  We have since legislated and now we also have section 4(7) that states, \"The national long term climate action strategy may include the following.\"  So, provided that I have made a strategy that includes those three things then that is legally compliant.  In other words, this layer is on top of the Supreme Court's judgment.  I suggest that section 4(7) is deleted or amended to be without prejudice to the obligation in section 4(6). <\/p> <p>  There is an interesting question on the relationship between the Bill's long-term strategy and the EU law's long-term strategy.  Section 4(8) states, in preparing the one under the Bill, the Government must \"have regard to\" the one under EU law, which has an annexe that sets out a very detailed range of things that need to be included.  Why does section 4(7) have a different and less comprehensive list?  We must be careful to preserve the import and effect of the Supreme Court's judgment. <\/p> <p>  Senator Higgins asked about language.<\/p><p>I absolutely think there is a need to differentiate and not have everything under this weak \"have regard to\" provision.  There was a debate on the 2015 Act at the time on whether this should happen and there was an argument that \"have regard to\" should be strengthened to \"comply with\".  The argument against this was there might be mutually contradictory provisions and people could not necessarily comply with all of them.  That change was only narrowly defeated in the Seanad in a 14 to 12 vote.  This time around, if we have a lengthy list of things, it might be interesting to look at it to differentiate and pick out, as the Senator said, those where the obligation ought to be that we act consistently with the provisions.  Interestingly, the heads of the 2019 Fine Gael Bill adopted the principle of public bodies being consistent with obligations in the context of local authority plans, whereby the local authorities were required to act consistently with matters included in quite a long list in section 4(9) of the heads of the Bill.  The principle is there.  It is another thing that has been weakened between the heads of the 2019 Bill and this Bill.  Now the obligation on local authorities is just to take account of the matters and not act consistently with them.<\/p><p> On the question of the Climate Change Advisory Council, my suggestion is to broaden the areas of expertise.  I know Dr. &Aacute;ine Ryall also made this point last week, with regard to having legal expertise on it.  This is very important because this area is underpinned by the UN framework convention, the Paris Agreement and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  It would be very important to have legal expertise.  I also suggest that expertise in the broad field of just transition would be very important, as would representation for youth and future generations.  Committee members might ask how future generations can be represented in an organisation such as the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Several countries have created an institution called the ombudsperson for future generations, whose specific role it is to be the voice for future generations.

At present, it has no role to play in the setting of sectoral budgets, for example.  It is all done by the Minister.  It might be considered obligatory for the Minister to consult with the Climate Change Advisory Council and ascertain whether the sectoral budgets being proposed are consistent with the overall national carbon budget.  This would also lead into the issue of interim targets.  The role of the CCAC could well be to look at the annual progress towards achieving carbon budgets and to make a statement on it, which would have to be taken seriously by the Minister and Government of the day.  It would be a very powerful thing.  The original model for the CCAC was supposed to be the Fiscal Advisory Council and that is a model we still could impose upon the Bill in terms of the CCAC.  It is a question of whether we are on track.<\/p> <p>  Many public bodies have annual values.  They have a glide path to achieve, for example, in energy efficiency.  I do not think it would be incompatible to have in this area annual targets and glide paths to follow in terms of whether we are on track.  The CCAC could have an important role in making statements on this, which would be important to emphasise.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Whitmore's observation on nature-based solutions, it is true we have a jigsaw of policies to handle and we have not done very well in terms of protecting our water courses, biodiversity or air quality.  We have also been exceeding our obligations in ammonia in recent years.<\/p><p>All the pieces of this jigsaw somehow must be brought into the climate Act, not in terms of specifically mentioning each one but by giving the framework whereby they can be tackled by a proactive Department to achieve end products in these areas.  That is all I would say.  There is an issue in respect of carbon neutrality and at what level do we achieve carbon neutrality, be that high emission, high sequestration or low emission, low sequestration.  These are also important issues.  I would not like us to see the high emission, high sequestration model because I have doubts about the validity of sequestration achieving its ends in those areas.  Therefore, we probably should flesh out what we mean by carbon neutrality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Professor John Sweeney","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":187,"content":"<p>On Senator Higgins' question about the role of the Climate Change Advisory Council, it would be valuable for the advisory council to advise not just on what the overall budget should be but also on potential opportunities within different sectors etc.  That is the sort of role it is performing at present; giving advice in its annual reports on things it thinks ought to be done.  That is definitely worth looking at further.<\/p> <p>  On the question of biodiversity and better implementation of existing law, I think there are two prongs to it.  The first is to look at the idea I suggested earlier of getting a general obligation relating to biodiversity and applying to all public bodies into section 15 of this Bill.  It is absolutely right that a key piece of the jigsaw is better implementation of existing biodiversity obligations, because a lot of work needs to be done there.  Forestry is one area where we really need to strengthen the implementation of biodiversity law but also to look generally at impact assessment law and how the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive is operating.  That is relevant to climate and biodiversity, because at present, we are not doing environmental impact assessments of forestry plantations.  Therefore, we are not considering in any detail the question of whether a particular forest actually will sequester carbon over its lifetime or rather, whether it will be a persistent source of carbon, because, for example, it is planted on peat soils.  There are some really important issues there.  <\/p> <p>  On Senator O'Reilly's question on interaction between interim targets and climate budgets, on looking at the different legislative frameworks, some of them use both.  It is not that they have picked one or the other because there is a symbiotic relationship between targets and budgets.  Interestingly, in the evidence given before the committee last week by the departmental official, it is clear that there is a symbiotic relationship, because the Department official said that the first two budgets to be proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council need to be within the framework of the programme for Government, which is a 7% average per annum.  That is an example of the setting of a target by policy, albeit not in law, and asking for budgets that are compatible with that policy.<\/p> <p>  I might just come back to Senator Boylan's point on justiciability, because I did not have the chance to say anything about that and I meant to.  It is very clear to me, as a former drafting lawyer, that the language in the Bill has been crafted with a view to making legal accountability more difficult.  In some respects, that has happened between the heads of the Bill of 2019 and the current text.  What intervened in the meantime?  The Supreme Court's judgment in Climate Case Ireland.  I pointed to examples in my opening statement of where that has happened, but it is clear that an attempt has been made here to make this Bill less justiciable.  However, I believe that is counterproductive because reducing emissions is what is needed.  We need to reduce emissions and pursue a just transition in a way that is compatible with restoring, enhancing and conserving biodiversity.  Consequently, making the Act litigation-proof is not the way to achieve those things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2020102100002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Andrew Jackson"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":188,"content":"<p>We are out of time.

Our respective committees have enjoyed a strong working relationship in recent years.  Today's virtual meeting is a welcome opportunity to continue that dialogue.  To scrutinise the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and Ireland has been one of my committee's overriding priorities.  In December 2016 we published our first report after the Brexit vote on Brexit UK-Ireland relations.  That was the first of what is now 74 reports in our canon.  We conducted a number of visits to Belfast, Dublin and the Border region.<\/p> <p>  Following our analysis of the original backstop in December 2018, we published detailed reports on the revised withdrawal agreement and protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland in January and June 2020. <\/p> <p>  After last week&rsquo;s European Council, the Prime Minister said that the UK \"should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia&rsquo;s based on simple principles of global free trade\".  The committee, however, has consistently held that it is greatly in the interests of all concerned that a mutually advantageous free trade agreement is concluded.  Therefore our hope is that both the UK and the EU will be willing to make the necessary compromises to ensure that negotiations reach a successful conclusion.<\/p> <p>  On 16 October, my committee published a report on Part 5 of the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill ahead of its Second Reading in the House of Lords on 19 October.  The report concluded that the UK Government has not disclosed any evidence that the EU has acted in bad faith, and has not explained why it chose not to use the withdrawal agreement&rsquo;s safeguard, arbitration and dispute resolution procedures, or why it chose instead to take pre-emptive and unilateral action through the Bill.  In the absence of these explanations, the committee expressed the hope that the Government would undertake to remove Part 5 while seeking to reach an agreement with the EU both on the future UK-EU relationship and on the implementation of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, the report acknowledged the UK Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to the Belfast or Good Friday Agreement and its legitimate concern that a rigid interpretation of the protocol, by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, could undermine it.  Yet the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement is itself made up of three interlocking strands: supporting North-South, east-west and internal Northern Ireland relationships.  The challenge before the withdrawal agreement joint committee, which met earlier this week, is to come up with solutions on implementation of the protocol that maintain this delicate equilibrium.<\/p> <p>  More than ever, it is incumbent on all parties, including the UK Government, the EU, the Irish Government, and the Northern Ireland Executive, to work in a common endeavour to prioritise and address urgently the interests, stability and prosperity of the people and communities of Northern Ireland.  As we concluded in our first report, anything less would diminish the efforts of all those who have worked so hard for peace and good relations across these islands.<\/p> <p>  We look forward to discussing these issues with the committee this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Kinnoull"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>The committee members have a script before them.

I will ask my colleagues when they speak for the first time to say which party they come from.  I am non-affiliated.  I came from the crossbench beforehand so I do not have a party.<\/p> <p>  The first part of Deputy Richmond's question was whether we had a response to our letter with nine questions of 18 September.  The answer to that is we have not had a response yet.  That is very rare and unusual because the Cabinet Office, in particular, is normally pretty good at responding.  I suppose they are very difficult questions to answer.  When we do have an answer I can assure the Deputy it will be made public immediately on our website.<\/p> <p>  Second, I will set out the factual background of the timings of the Bill.  We have had the Second Reading and the regret motion, which I will ask my colleagues to comment on, but the amending Stages of the Bill are set down for seven days.  We will have Committee and Report Stages and those seven days begin next Monday, 26 October, and finish on 23 November.  I would expect the voting to happen in the latter part of those seven days on Report Stage.  I think more than seven days will be required but there are a few extra days available within that timetable whereby we might see the process still end on 23 November.<\/p><p>In common, no doubt, with Ireland's procedure, at any time the Government could choose in amending Stages to bring forward government amendments to remove Part 5 of the Bill.  I have no doubt that would form part of a package that represents a future relationship deal, so procedurally it would be very simple for them to excise Part 5 of the Bill, which is being seen as so difficult with the withdrawal agreement.<\/p><p> That said, I will hand over to my colleagues.

Yesterday's motion does not have much legislative force.  However, it has much political force and it was the biggest British Government defeat since the reform of the House of Lords in 1999, when almost all hereditary peers were taken out of the House of Lords.  Some leading Conservative Brexiteers supported the amendments, along with a large number - over 100 - non-affiliated peers.  This is important as if the vote were to be seen as about Brexit, it would have limited force.  The size of the vote suggests there is a general consensus that this is about the rule of law rather than Brexit itself, and this has a political force.<\/p> <p>  As Lord Kinnoull has said, the next issue is whether, over the next few weeks, the negotiations give the British Government space and justification to introduce its own amendments to the Bill.

One of the difficulties we face as a committee and in the House of Lords is the lack of evidence we have received to back up the Government's claim that the EU is acting in bad faith.  If it was, it would mean the Internal Market Bill and its clauses did not break international law.  Although one of our ministers stood up and said it did, we have also had Lord Keen and a minister, Mr. Michael Gove, alluding to the fact that they believed the EU is acting in bad faith.  Nobody in the Conservative Party, the House of Lords or the British Parliament as a whole would want to break international law so there is a difference of opinion on where one comes down in the circumstances of not having evidence.<\/p> <p>  The question was asked about dispute resolution and why the British Government did not choose to use that mechanism, as opposed to Part 5.  Again, there is no evidence, which makes the process very difficult.  Informally, I have been told the concern was that if the joint committee classified all agricultural goods and food products moving from the UK to Northern Ireland as being at risk, this would cause such an impact on the Northern Ireland economy - and, possibly, the peace in Northern Ireland given the unionist desire to remain intact as part of the UK - it would have a serious detrimental impact on the UK as a whole in the short term.  The time required to go through the disputes mechanisms would therefore be too long to save us from some of that impact.  That is why Part 5 became important.<\/p> <p>  As I said, my committee has not seen evidence for that and it is very hard to comment further than that.

The Governments of both Theresa May and Boris Johnson have had very serious difficulty in getting any type of Brexit deal or any type of movement on the Brexit negotiating position past the more hardline Brexiteers in the party.  That remains an issue for Boris Johnson's Government.  My view is that Part 5 was included in this Bill as a reassurance in the event that compromises would have to be made to get a Brexit deal across the line during the transition.  Essentially, it was signalling: \"Do not worry if you do not like things that we may have to agree because ultimately there will be a legislative provision which enables us to override things you do not like.\"  It is exactly the same tactic that was tried to get the original Brexit withdrawal agreement through last year.  That is my reading of why this was inserted.  It is a type of insurance policy, a signal to the Conservative Party backbenches in the House of Commons.

The British Government's response to that was Part 5.  It views it as a safety net.  I, too, would like to see it removed after the negotiations have reached a point where we all can sign up to them and agree on a sensible way forward as far as Northern Ireland is concerned.

They are giving quite comprehensive answers.  I welcome the fact that they are here.  I should put it on the record that on some level I would prefer that legislation that has an impact on any part of Ireland would not be carried out in Westminster, but we are where we are.  People are giving their views on the basis that the questions have not been answered yet by the British Government, but the two views given on Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill are that either it is part of an internal negotiation within the Conservative Party or it is a matter of putting pressure on in negotiations with the European Union.  There is a view here, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and a number of others have voiced it, that the European Union, even as a marketplace, is too important for Britain.  I could be wrong, but I understand that 45% of Britain's exports go to the European Union.  On that basis, this is seen, to some degree, as a negotiating gambit.<\/p> <p>  I come from Dundalk, which is on the Border, and obviously we have worries about businesses and the impact.  We would also worry if there was any possibility of circumventing the Irish protocol, if one believes some of the statements by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove or even David Frost, depending on what day of the week it is.  We are very worried about there being contingencies.  It is utterly unacceptable to impact on the lives of people in the Border area or that there would be any possibility of a return of a hard border.  I wish to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  In fairness, what a number of people have said here is that the major difficulty they have with Part 5 is the rule of law.  If that is the means by which it falls, so be it.  I am asking the witnesses for their view on where we go from here.  I am seeking some type of assurance insofar as they can give it.  They can give the general mood music between the House of Lords and the House of Commons regarding the chance of this legislative measure going through.  If it did in any way, shape or form, it would be utterly unacceptable.

There is another theory that it was simply to shake up the negotiation, to move fast on things and see if the deadlock in the future relationship negotiations could be cracked that way.  If so, I personally believe it was a grave error.  The degree of mistrust it created makes it more difficult to secure an agreement on level playing field enforcement and governance, which appear to be two of the three outstanding areas of difficulty in the negotiation.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what has been said about the desirability of securing a free trade agreement, and ideally a free trade agreement plus.  The difficulties of implementing the Irish and Northern Ireland protocol would become much greater in the event that there was a tariff war between the United Kingdom and the EU.  It is clear that many of the problems, such as the goods-at-risk problem, get much easier or disappear in the event that there is a deal.  If the deal includes level playing field provisions, that removes another of the likely difficulties in implementing the protocol.  Speaking personally, I believe it is very important that the protocol should be implemented in full.  As the Chairman said, we all must hope for sensible compromises on its implementation.<\/p><p>As to why we need a free trade agreement, it is not just in order to make the problem on which we are focusing this morning easier.  The whole relationship between the UK and the EU is likely to go through a bad patch if there is no deal and no agreement.  It is likely to become a bit rebarbative.  Without a foundation to build on, and in order to build up other agreements, we will take a while to rebuild the relationship.  This is particularly important with regard to matters like the Border and co-operation between law enforcement agencies.  I was struck by the difficulty law enforcement will have if the UK no longer has access to the Schengen information service, the European arrest warrant and so on.  It seems to me that it is not just about free trade but if there is no core of a free trade agreement, it will be very difficult to add on things like a security agreement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#E00900","nonspeaker":"Lord Kerr","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The issue of the rule of law is at the heart of this.

It is not just about Part 5.  If we feel we can act like this, the whole question about trust and how we act in different areas arises.  Clearly, trust has been undermined.  I share the view of Lord Kerr that this is probably about brinkmanship and an attempt to force the negotiations.  I am not sure if it is effective but time will tell.<\/p> <p>  As to the seriousness of the UK Government's position regarding an Australia-type deal as it calls it, that is, it means no deal at all, Michael Gove told us that it would be content with that.  What is clear is that our industry, be it manufacturing, services, farming or a new and significant aspect of our economy, would not be content with it.  I think it would be catastrophic.  We are not Australia.  We are not 10,500 miles from the EU and, as we know, geographic proximity is critical in trade flows.  I hope and pray that it is not the UK Government's genuine view that an Australia-type no-deal outcome would be acceptable.

We really appreciate the engagement this morning.  My colleagues have touched on some of the key issues.  The select committee's report is excellent and succinct and covers all aspects.  The committee has touched on all the questions we have been asking.  We would agree with the committee that the tensions, as the speakers from the committee have outlined, in the withdrawal agreement were known fully to both sides when it was signed up to so nobody went into that agreement with his or her eyes closed.  Perhaps that is why it is such a surprise that this particular difficulty has arisen given that the agreement was only agreed less than a year ago.<\/p> <p>  Given there is no evidence of the EU acting in bad faith, and I agree there is no evidence of that and I do not believe the EU has acted in bad faith in these negotiations, and the fact that the dispute resolution mechanism within the withdrawal agreement was not utilised, one would have to ask what the real purpose or intent behind the Internal Market Bill was.  Perhaps it was a negotiating strategy or, as one of members of the select committee said, it was to reinvigorate and kick start the negotiating process.  Perhaps it was trying to be a bit too clever.  I really do not know but, unfortunately, the outcome has left a bad taste in the mouths of those involved in the negotiations.  The fact that this could happen has definitely bred much mistrust across the board.  From an Irish perspective, it is important that a significant amount of blame is not being heaped on all Members of Parliament or the country.  There is an appreciation that these are difficult negotiations, that it probably is a negotiating strategy and that the intention was not to harm Ireland, the North or the peace process.  I do not think that was the intention behind it even though that has been suggested.  <\/p> <p>  I have two more specific questions.  The first is around state aid and the level playing field provisions.  I am curious about the thoughts of Lord Kinnoull and the other members of the committee.  Is there an appreciation of why this is so important?  Is there an appreciation at Government level and in the UK Parliament as to why this is so important from an EU perspective?  If there is going to be access to the market, similar rules must apply to all those in the market.  Is that appreciated?  Is it genuinely the view of the UK Government, and I know not everybody can comment on this, that it is an unreasonable request from the EU, that is, that if one wants free access to the market, one must apply the same rules and that level playing field provisions are there to safeguard matters and ensure that UK companies cannot get an unfair advantage over EU companies?  Does Lord Kinnoull think this is understood?  <\/p> <p>  We will get to a point where the Brexit process concludes.  I hope sincerely that we have a free trade agreement - certainly by the end of the year - and can move past this.  I would be interested in hearing the thoughts of the committee on what kind of mechanism it believes we should put in place for future engagement between Ireland and the UK because that is really important.  From my perspective, and I am sure the view is shared across the board, the UK is a very close friend of Ireland.  We want that relationship to be maintained.  We want a very close and special working relationship with the UK beyond Brexit.  The mechanisms that have been there between the two countries for the past 45 years have been at EU level.  We have engaged weekly and monthly through the institutions and the European Parliament and we will no longer have that, so what does the committee think both countries should do to ensure that really close co-operation and working relationship post-Brexit when we put all this behind us and start working together?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#F00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":231,"content":"<p>The Senator's questions are excellent.

I am incredibly tempted to talk to the joint committee for ages about what we think we should do but I will let my colleagues do that.<\/p> <p>  I refer the joint committee back to some of the evidence we took from Lord Frost in the past in terms of state aid.  Essentially, what the UK has been suggesting are presidential provisions that have been contained in other treaties - both EU treaties with third countries and third country-third country treaties - because the state aid issue comes up in every single free trade agreement between different countries.

The whole of the Conservative Party would want to have a proper free trade agreement with the EU but I do not think that this extends to \"at any cost\" among a significant number of people within the party.  Therefore, when Boris Johnson says he is prepared to leave on Australia-style deal terms, which are pretty much the same as WTO terms, I think he is serious about that.<\/p> <p>  Building on what Lord Kinnoull said about state aid, again, the rationale behind pushing back on what the EU requires on state aid is not just because there are provisions that are used more normally in trade agreements between different countries, which we would be happy to adhere to.  It is also about the sovereignty of the UK.<\/p><p>We are coming out of the EU and wish to be an independent nation state and set our own rules.  We do not wish to have legacy arrangements with the EU whereby we are left following rules over which we have no control, although we are prepared to sign up to standard trade agreement-type rules which cover the same issues.  That is where the block is.<\/p><p> I entirely agree with the Senator that peace in Northern Ireland is of paramount importance.  That is a generally held view across the whole of Ireland and the UK.  I do not think there was any intention to undermine that in Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill, although some people have stated that that is its effect.  I will not go into detail regarding why I do not think it will do so in practical reality, but I can understand that people are concerned in that regard.  I touched on the reason for the Part being included in the first place in my earlier contribution.  If what we are being told is true - I suspect it was a verbal comment and we have not seen evidence of it - there was a sudden realisation that the way the protocol was worded in terms of the joint committee could be used in a way that would be vexatious and cause enormous difficulties for the Northern Ireland economy and, although I hesitate to say it, the peace process as well.  If a comment was made that the EU was serious about designating all products that came from the UK to Northern Ireland as being at risk, then the UK believed it needed to do something strong to fight back, probably partly as a negotiating tactic, but also to show that we were not going to be pushed around and agree to things to which we would not otherwise agree in order to avoid that possibility.  As I stated, I hope it will eventually come out when some form of agreement is reached.<\/p><p>  On the issue of liaison between Ireland and the UK, I sincerely hope that we continue to have a productive dialogue.  It is useful for both countries.  I hope some sort of committee, such as this one, will continue and that we will have regular contact with it.

She told the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, during the committee meeting on 7 October that on seeing Part 5 of the Internal Markets Bill she was gobsmacked.  That is exactly right.  One could say the House of Lords was gobsmacked too.  I think I speak for the committee on that.  Speaking personally, I strongly agree with Baroness Couttie that nobody intends to damage the Belfast treaty and the Good Friday Agreement and that nobody wishes to see the return of a hard border and all the problems that would create.  I am sure she is right about that.<br\/><br\/>On the Senator's question regarding a level playing field, I am puzzled because I do not understand why the British Government stepped back from the political declaration it signed on 19 October 2019, the same day this agreement was reached.  The language about geographical proximity and economic interdependence requiring a level playing field seems to me to be very reasonable language.  More important, we signed up to it.  I think the European Union overbid by suggesting that the level playing field had to be policed by EU institutions.  That raises sovereignty issues, as Baroness Couttie stated.  It is clear where the landing zone is for an agreement on this issue.  It is clear that Mr. Barnier has stepped back from insisting that the European Union should be the judge and jury and that he is looking for the British Government to commit itself to agreed principles and to an independent authority, future transparency and to a disputes settlement procedure.  That seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable landing zone and I do not understand why the British Government is still finding difficulty with it.  As a former negotiator, I have <i>d'information professionnelle<\/i>and I believe these problems should be relatively easy to settle.  I think I know how the issue could be solved.  As Lord Wood stated at the outset, the problem is that there are some members of the Conservative Party who would may find any concession on sovereignty grounds offensive, even a level-playing field solution where the involvement of the EU is limited to agreement now on principles and the ability to use a disputes settlement procedure.  The Prime Minister must decide between doing what British business undoubtedly wants him to do and doing what a group within his party wants him to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Lord Kerr"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I am sorry that my colleagues and I have not really grappled with the second of the Senator's questions, regarding what should happen in terms of building out the relationship.

There is an inexorable rule of trade, particularly with traded goods, that distance matters.  I do think we are likely to find, if we end up causing difficulties in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic, that there will be additional difficulties in securing closer free trade arrangements with, for example, the United States.  If there is no free trade agreement and that, in consequence, complicates the problems of working out the details of the implementation of the protocol, I think that we would go through a rather bad patch that might be quite protracted.

The transition if we get no deal or a very thin deal will be bumpy.  Therefore, there will be an incentive to push ahead and get things agreed.  I only hope that it does not take so long and is not so high profile as these negotiations have, inevitably, been.  It is not just about negotiating with the other side to get the best deal.  It is done in a very public forum with everybody criticising and there is the audience of the general public both in the EU and UK, which have to be satisfied, as well as the actual negotiations themselves and the politicians.

It will be very difficult in these remote times but there is no time like the present in terms of beginning the necessary preparatory work.

It would be worthwhile for both countries to have a proper engagement on what we think the future relationship between our two countries will look like and how we can work well together.  That said, it is a very positive starting point that both countries are saying that this is really important to us, that we want to do this and that we want a good relationship post Brexit.  We want to have constant connectivity and dialogue between both Governments and Parliaments, which is a really positive starting point.<\/p> <p>  One of the consistent comments from this country throughout the Brexit process is how utterly saddened we are by the fact that Britain is leaving the EU, and I do not think that is ever going to go away.  We are losing such a close friend and influential partner at the EU table.  Britain was one of the members that helped to establish the European Union and underpinned so many of its fundamental values and freedoms that we enjoy today.  Britain leaving is a huge loss and I hope that the door is always open, although that is not a conversation for now.  Indeed, I do not think the UK wants to enter into that conversation now but I hope that the door is always open.  We live in hope that some time in the future, further down the road, the relationship will become even closer again.  Who knows what might happen?  Future relationship structures are really important for both countries and the work should start immediately on putting them together and finding something that works for both countries.<\/p> <p>  I wish to raise a practical, day-to-day issue around the transit of goods through the UK, from Dover to Calais, from 1 January 2021.  In terms of minimising the impact on this country, we would appreciate it if every effort could be made to ensure that there are not massive queues in Dover and that our trucks can get through.  That is one practical starting point in terms of helping us from 1 January.  Baroness Couttie made reference to a so-called thin future trading agreement, which is something we would be fearful of too.  We do not want to see something cobbled together at the eleventh hour that is weak and not comprehensive enough to minimise disruption.  I hope we can avoid that.  I agree with her that if issues are not concluded by the end of the year, every effort should be made to tidy up any loose ends as soon as possible thereafter.

Historically, we have had patches of poor relations but we have spent more than 20 years building the closest of relationships between our two countries.  We must think about mitigating the harm of the next few months.  Senator Chambers spoke about one aspect of that, namely, that 40% of our exports to the Continent transit through the UK and if there is a very significant disruption of that, it would compound our difficulties.  If there is a fractious break, it will sour relations and people will start blaming other people.

It is really remiss of us at this late stage not to have planned what our interactions, as states and really important neighbours, are going to look like.  We have had a really easy relationship at European Council meetings.  Some of us here have had the privilege of attending same in recent years.  I can only speak from experience but when I was new to the European Council, the first person I went to was my British counterpart, even though I had never met her, because I felt and thought, given the easy relationship between our countries, that she would be friendly and nice to me, and of course she was.  We are going to miss that hugely.  We will have no formal interaction other than through the British-Irish Parliamentary Association.  We do have the North-South Ministerial Council, but with so many decisions being made at Westminster about what happens in the North, we should have formal engagements.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Howlin is right about the concerns if things do not go well, although I really hope they do.  I am really impressed by the pragmatism of everyone who has spoken this morning in terms of what we expect in the coming weeks, but if things do not go well, on 1 January we are going to find ourselves in a \"he said, she said\" scenario and none of us wants to be the one who gets the blame.  That is not the ideal environment for what has been a hugely fruitful, enjoyable and harmonious relationship for the most part for as long as we have been neighbours.

There are a number of dimensions to any such relationship, including, in particular, the intergovernmental and interparliamentary dimensions.  There are also other dimensions involved.  On the interparliamentary side, I have met many of the members' colleagues at the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the European Union, COSAC, over several years and I have always enjoyed very good and fun interaction on all sorts of ideas.  That must be replaced because it was a key part of the interparliamentary dimension and there is every chance we will not be invited, or not fully invited, to its meetings in the future.  It is simply a matter of trying to analyse what we will lose, working out whether that matters and then replacing it with something else.  There is a strong case for a mild increase in the level of engagement at interparliamentary and intergovernmental levels to reflect the closeness of the inevitable relationship between these islands.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of the land bridge, I was going to ask Lord Wood whether he had any particular views on its importance and on what might be done in order to ensure that, whatever happens, the land bridge continues to operate after the end of the transition period.

I have a couple of remarks on the excellent thoughts we have just heard from Deputies and Senators.  Overall, one of the legitimate criticisms made of the UK as regards Brexit over the past two or three years is that we have done inadequate planning for a no-deal outcome again and again.  This has partly been a negotiating ploy on the part of the Government.  In no part of our relations with the rest of Europe and the world is the absence of no-deal planning more important than in respect of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Reluctantly, I believe we have to start thinking hard-headedly about arrangements for closer co-operation, as everyone has suggested, in the event of a very thin deal or no deal whatsoever.  I totally agree with colleagues in Dublin who have spoken this morning about using the institutional network created under the Good Friday Agreement.  This presents many opportunities for reinvigoration.  I had not heard about it before, but I am very sympathetic to the idea of synchronising meetings with EU meetings.  That would be a very good idea.<\/p> <p>  One of the issues with regard to trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain which concerns me most - and it is something on which our committee has pushed the Government - is the question of exit summary declarations and what paperwork Northern Irish traders will have to deal with when dealing with Great Britain and what regulations will apply.  This has become a sort of lightning rod because it looks like a purely UK issue on one hand while, on the other hand, the EU's customs code requires documents to be completed.  We asked Michael Gove about this a couple of weeks ago and he maintained that the Government's position is that no such declarations will be required.  That is clearly contrary to the general view of what is required by the EU's code.  I do not have really hard views on what must happen in this respect but, whether there is a deal or not, an intense network of institutions will be required to co-operate in policing such declarations, if they are required, and state aid.  Lord Kerr raised the issue of policing or supervising adherence to rules.  These will be matters of mutual interest for London and Dublin, as well as for everyone else in the EU.  The sorts of institutional co-operation regarding these issues, which are very small but which could be incredibly destabilising if got wrong, about which we have been talking will be absolutely crucial, particularly in the first year or two.  That is why the committee members' views on the strengthening of institutional relationships at all levels are so important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Lord Wood"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":263,"content":"<p>I will now ask Lord Oates to come in.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Lord Kinnoull"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I thank the members for their interesting questions and responses.

I know that once we get into the realm of sovereignty relating to fisheries, it is not just about fishermen.  There is an emotive connection too.  Great Britain is an island and Ireland is an island.  There is a community connection.  When one considers the pelagic sector, with mackerel spawning off the coast of Galway, spending time off the coast of Mayo and ending up in British waters off the coast of Scotland, we have issues relating to fishermen's rights and claims on the fish.  Upwards of 45% of our fishing effort is in the pelagic sector, which is a multi-million euro industry, and it happens in British waters.  It is a complex area.  I know the witnesses' report did not go into sector-specific matters.  It was a broad report.  In future, if the witnesses are asking what we can do with regard to future engagement, we need to keep that on our radar, both with regard to the sensitivity of it and using language such as proportionate safeguards.  An analysis of that has to be carried out.<\/p> <p>  We have a few minutes left and will go back to Senators Chambers and Martin.<\/p> <p>  Lord Oates asked a question about landing zones.  I will be guided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We will leave that in the realm of the deliberations between EU negotiators and the United Kingdom negotiators.  We might park that matter for the important talks that we will have in the coming period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#L00100","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I was going to respond to what Lord Oates said.  Lord Kerr initially spoke about landing zones.  It is important that both sides are willing to fly a little bit to land in that zone and that there is compromise.  Lord Oates has been quite persuasive in what he said about the potential need for an independent body to do that.  I take on board that the UK had the right to leave the European Union and has the right to determine for itself as a nation what rules it will operate under.  We fully accept and respect that.  Given Lord Oates's party's position that it is pro-Europe and anti-Brexit, he made a persuasive point.  It needs to at least be relayed that this was discussed but I agree with the Chair that it will be a matter for the negotiating team and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it is a fair comment all the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#L00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":270,"content":"<p>I anticipated an answer along those lines.

When Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and others spoke about it, it was about North-South reconciliation but maybe there is an added dynamic that we should look at, of east-west economic co-operation.  Talking about unthinkables, while it is not for this forum, I will out the possibility of a physical bridge or rail link rising from the ashes of this fallout.  The more times that is outed, the better.  There could be some unthinkable brilliance that arises from this, which many would consider to be an economic and social catastrophe.  Maybe the bridge will go back on the table, preferably linking the Republic of Ireland, maybe at Dundalk, directly to our neighbours.  It could be a rail link to carry freight.  Maybe that is something that we could look at in the long term.  It is an old chestnut that raises its head every decade or so.  Maybe Britain leaving the EU might focus people's minds to give that more serious consideration in the long term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#L00300","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I will go back to Lord Kinnoull and we will conclude after his contributions if that is agreeable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2020102100002#L00400","speaker":"1548"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>To take the Chairman up on the matter of fisheries, we are a family of committees because it is such a big subject, so we have an environment subcommittee which has written a couple of reports on fish in recent years.  Although it has not tackled those particular issues, because it has been working on landing obligations and such, it knows what it is talking about.  It is quite busy at present.  I will take back what the Chairman said and ask whether it might consider doing some work along those lines.  It is a complex area.  I thank the Chairman for those thoughts.<\/p> <p>  In closing, I note two things.  The Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol is a pleasing document.  It starts with the recitals, which set the scene and tone, and are aspirational statements that I think everyone who is on this call would agree with all round.  There are two pages of aspirations and behind those are the hard legal terms of the 20 or so articles over the next few pages.  The rest is essentially a list of EU law that will apply in Northern Ireland.  Marrying hard legal articles with aspirational statements is something which will need trust.  I think that trust has been dented in recent times, particularly with the arrival of Part 5 of the Internal Market Bill, for example.  Rebuilding that trust is the sort of thing that interactions such as this will be key to.  I will close by saying that we are keen to be part of that process of rebuilding trust and making sure that there is an enhanced dialogue at the interparliamentary level.  We have a similar intention to have an enhanced dialogue with the Northern Ireland Assembly and we have good relations with it and its committees, and have joint committee meetings with them.<\/p> <p>  I thank the committee for welcoming us to its meeting today.

I raised several issues where I sought reports from the HSE, one of which was on testing and tracing.<\/p> <p>  Several members made the point yesterday that the anecdotal evidence coming back from people working in that area is that it is a system which is under real pressure.  There is a lack of training and staff with a real problem with morale.  There is also a problem with the ability of that system to work.  What we sought yesterday was a detailed report from the HSE.  That has been overtaken by events today where we had serious information put into the public domain of up to 2,500 sick people who are being asked to become contact tracers themselves and will receive text messages instead of phone calls.  That is completely and absolutely unacceptable.  This is a complete mess for which the Government must bear responsibility.<\/p> <p>  I am asking that the committee meets next week on this issue.  I know we will be in recess next week but it is fundamentally important.  It is rare that I ask for any committee to meet outside of when it is scheduled to meet, but such is the seriousness of this issue, however, and the impact it is having on people.  It must be borne in mind that this is coming at a time when we are going into more restrictions where much is being asked of individuals in terms of level 5.  The least that people expect is that the State and the Government will get its house in order to ensure testing and tracing are what they should be.  There is a real problem and we have to get a grip on it as a committee.  I am asking the Chairman that the committee will meet next week to bring in the HSE, the Minister, if necessary, and whoever is responsible for testing and tracing in order that we can put questions to them as to what the problems are and why it got to this point.  It is a reasonable request and I ask that it will be supported by other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#A00300","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":281,"content":"<p>A number of members raised this yesterday.

There is a problem which testers and tracers face in the context of rising numbers.  More than 1,200 cases on average a day is part of the problem.  Equally, part of the problem is a lack of capacity.  This has been flagged time and again by many of us with staff coming to us telling us there are problems.  Time and again this has been raised.<\/p> <p>  I have examples.  There are 64 medical laboratory aides who are in a pool who could have been employed since July but have not been taken on by the State.  There are 14 medical scientists.  Why in God's name have those staff not been employed?  There are 64 clerical officers and yet we are told there is not enough staff.  It is the case that rising numbers, in part, are putting huge pressure on the system.  Equally, there are problems with lack of capacity and we did not use the summer months to build it up.  In fact, many staff who were seconded, rightly so at the time, were brought back to what they were doing and not replaced.<\/p> <p>  There is a real problem here.  I do not believe two hours of their schedule next week - if they can do it remotely - would be too onerous.

The INMO is delighted to present to the committee today.  I will briefly go through our opening statement, which members will already have received.  It is broken down into three main parts.  The first part relates to the additional beds that have been announced in the budget as well as the winter plan.  We welcome these beds.  However, we ask members of the committee to be conscious that each time they hear the word \"bed\" they must think the word \"nurse\" because without the nursing staff to staff the beds, unfortunately we are not going to make progress in expanding the much-needed capacity in the health service.  In Limerick, for example, we are balloting our members because there is an acute shortage of nursing posts.  We are attempting to open 90 additional beds but we are running with 125 vacancies before we start.  The legacy of the moratorium still stands.  We have to work very hard to recruit and we have to make sure pressure is not put on the system to open beds if there are not sufficient nurses to provide safe care.<\/p> <p>  At our conference last Friday week, the Minister for Health confirmed that the framework on nurse staffing, which is Government policy, will now be used to determine how many nurses and healthcare assistants are needed to provide care to patients in beds.  This is important and welcome.  It is a scientific method to determine how many nurses are needed.  We understand this is funded for the incoming year.  The settlement of our strike in 2019 stipulated that this funding would be made available for the three years following the dispute, with the staffing to be completed by the end of 2021.  Multiannual funding is required.  Funding for this year is welcome but it will only extend to model 4 hospitals.  We have to be assured that when nurses are looking to their future in the public service, they understand there are commitments behind the correct staffing from a financial perspective.  Otherwise they will leave and go elsewhere.  That has been the practice.<\/p> <p>  We have set out the staffing levels at which we are running in our submission.  The most recent census produced by the HSE tells us that in the staff nurse grade, which is the main grade of nurse working in the health service, there has been an increase of just under 300 whole-time equivalents since December last year.  There have been significant reductions in our community services.  We have 40 fewer public health nurses and five fewer midwives.  Our midwifery workforce is very important because in order to implement the maternity strategy, we have to meet the ratio of one midwife per 29.5 births and we are far away from that.  That means we are providing unsafe care in sections of the public health service because in some of our maternity units we are now at a rate of one midwife per 40 births, which has been proven internationally to be unsafe and dangerous.  Nurse and midwife staffing is very important.  The good news is that there is a scientific tool to determine staffing levels.<\/p> <p>  In our submission, we are advocating that in the medium and long term we should look at increasing our undergraduate places in order to ensure we are training sufficient numbers and have room.  The good news is that 5,000 school leavers applied for nursing courses as their first preference in 2019 and we provided 1,700 places to them.  There is room there to increase the number of undergraduate places.  We need to do it fast and we need to be cleverer about retention because it is a big problem.  We are still heavily reliant on overseas recruitment, particularly non-EU recruitment.  We have put those figures in our submission.  More than half the nurses who registered in Ireland in 2019 were from outside the EU, mainly from India and the Philippines.  We are hugely reliant on recruitment from overseas and we have to make sure that continues in the current climate.  It is continuing.  It is slower, but it is continuing.<\/p> <p>  The children's hospital requires 300 additional nurses just to open and we are already short and are down below that 300.  This means that when the children's hospital begins to operate its services, it will not be able to open all of its beds.  It simply will not have the nursing numbers.  We need to ensure we are training sufficient numbers at undergraduate level to make that timeframe.  Unfortunately, we are two years behind on that already.<\/p> <p>  Right now, there is a crisis in the health service because of the high number of healthcare workers infected with Covid-19.  Of those, we know that up to 34% are nurses.  We have a high level of absence.  Many of our members are reporting absences stretching into 16 and 17 weeks, particularly in areas where they have been directly caring for Covid patients.  We need a fresh look at the occupational health policies of the HSE, particularly the policy that dictates that workers come back to work even if they have been close contacts of a Covid case.  We believe that is wrong and is not aligned with the testing regime.  There is no routine testing in our acute hospitals.  We have surveyed our members and they want routine testing in acute hospitals.  There is also the added difficulty of childcare.  This committee has heard from us on this matter before.  If there are any changes in Government policy on the closure of schools, we have to make sure that for the female-dominated workforce that is our nursing workforce, thought is put into how their childcare needs will be looked after in that circumstance.<\/p><p>We cannot have a repeat of what happened earlier in the pandemic, in March and April, when that was basically left to chance.  We must ensure that, prior to any decisions regarding schools, provision is made for childcare for the 91% female workforce that is leading on providing care against this terrible virus in acute hospitals and communities.<\/p><p> I bring the attention of the committee to the fifth recommendation of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  It states that Covid-19 as an infection should be made an occupational illness.  The INMO previously called for that to be done and the committee recommended that it should be catered for in the health and safety legislation.  We need stronger input into the health and safety of the workforce that is meeting the virus head-on daily and nightly.  The INMO has been and remains critical of the supports available to members of the workforce when they are infected, as well as of their protections at work.  The quality and supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, has improved but, each week for the past two weeks, 50 nurses have been infected with Covid-19 while at work.  That is a very high figure.   I am happy to take questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#B01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":304,"content":"<p>The Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, represents almost 7,000 medical professionals working across the acute primary care community and public health settings.  Dr. Sadlier and I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on medical workforce planning, but we draw its attention to the fact that one year ago, we presented to the then health committee on this topic.  It is a matter of extreme regret that little or nothing has changed since then.  In fact, the situation has worsened despite numerous reports pointing to the chronic shortage of doctors.<\/p> <p>  Covid does not only expose the fragility of the health service in terms of its infrastructure and bed capacity.  In addition, we are facing the enormous challenge of asking an understaffed and exhausted to deliver Covid and non-Covid care.  It is evident that post Covid we will continue to have too few doctors to meet the health demands of an increasing population unless we act now.<\/p> <p>  The current picture is one of shortages across the system.  There are 500 vacant consultant posts, leading to growing waiting lists - there are now more than 840,000 people on a waiting list.  That leads to delayed diagnosis and treatment for patients which, in turn, leads to increased mortality.  Ireland has the lowest number of specialists per head of population and not a single specialty has the required number working in it.  <\/p> <p>  The HSE national doctors training and planning unit suggests that the HSE has a deficit of 1,600 hospital consultants.  If one includes psychiatry, that deficit rises to approximately 2,000 consultants.  Each year, slightly more than 700 doctors enter basic specialist training, while approximately 500 doctors enter higher specialist training.  The HSE estimates that a minimum of 648 additional training posts are needed just to cover hospital-based specialties.  That does not include general practitioner, GP, training places.  <\/p> <p>  The healthcare system relies on a large number of doctors from non-EU or EEA countries who, up to now, have had no access to training posts.  Although legislation has been passed to enable such access, all that is doing is increasing the number of doctors competing for a static number of training posts, which does not improve the manpower situation.  A minimum of 600 GPs will retire in the coming years.  The HSE estimates that we need an additional 1,260 GPs in the coming years to ensure we can meet the demands of patients.  It is imperative that up to 350 GP training posts per year are funded to meet future needs.<\/p> <p>  Incredibly, there are only 60 public health medical specialists.  The Crowe Horwath report which was accepted by the Government recommends increasing that number and ensuring they are supported by multidisciplinary teams.  By comparison, New Zealand and Scotland, which have roughly the same population as Ireland, have 180 public health consultants.  Worryingly, 50% of our public health medical specialists are due to retire in the next five years and there are insufficient trainees in the system to match those retirements, let alone to cope with any expansion of the workforce.<\/p> <p>  We have seen increasingly high rates of emigration by doctors in recent years and can state with some degree of certainty that that trend will continue.  Doctors leave to enhance their skills and receive additional training but, unfortunately, they are not returning to Ireland.  Doctors wish to work in a system that enables them to deliver care to patients and in which they are respected.  For many, that now means going abroad.<\/p> <p>  For some years, the IMO and other organisations have been highlighting these issues.  Successive Governments have commissioned and produced reports, all of which support the need to plan and resource medical manpower.  What has been lacking is implementation, investment and resources.  At a minimum, there is a need to resolve the disastrous two-tier pay system for consultants.  It is inequitable and unfair and has been the biggest barrier to recruitment this country has ever seen.  This politically motivated pay cut has had a very damaging and dangerous impact on the health services.  Although we welcome the commitment to hire an additional 300 consultants in 2021, it does not even address the current 500 vacancies.  There needs to be far more ambition in terms of recruitment targets to support the clinical programmes and models of care.<\/p> <p>  Public health specialists must be awarded consultant contracts.  It is particularly galling in the context of Covid that the very doctors on whom we are relying to manage the pandemic are not recognised for their skills and expertise.  We must significantly and rapidly increase the number of training posts across the specialties and ensure that training programmes lead to clear career pathways for trainees.  Far more account must be taken of the needs of trainees and the changing demographic of those coming into medicine.  In general practice, the transfer of care from acute settings to the community must be properly supported.  It is very difficult to manage unplanned care and GPs are suffering from the same capacity issues as the hospital sector.  In light of the demographics of the GP base, who are an older population, supports for GPs who wish to establish in general practice must be delivered.<\/p> <p>  I ask the committee to note that we have all the recommendations we need in terms of planning for our future needs but what we lack is investment and funding.  This situation is bad for doctors but, more importantly, it is disastrous for patients and health outcomes.  Dr. Sadlier and I are happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":305,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to participate in this discussion.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghda and Ms Clyne have eloquently pointed out that capacity is not just about beds, it is about people, including highly skilled professionals across all the medical and nursing disciplines that we need.  It is clear that the health system lacks that capacity and has done for some time.   The Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, represents 3,200 hospital consultants practising in acute hospital and mental health services, or approximately 95% of the total.<\/p> <p>  My remarks will mostly focus on the reasons consultant posts cannot be filled.  Ms Clyne pointedly observed that these are not new reasons.  They have been known and pointed out for many years.  One of the greatest deficits is around listening.  Some people will not listen, particularly to craft representatives.  Too often, the offering from the employers' side is a one-size-fits-all, take it or leave it approach.  If the employers' side were to listen carefully and implement what well-meaning and informed professionals from all of the groups represented here today were saying, we would not be in the current position.<\/p> <p>  As all present are aware, there is a severe shortage of hospital consultants.  As Ms Clyne stated, there are 500 unfulfilled posts.  Government reports itself have outlined an additional 2.000 posts are needed.  The result of that shortage is very damaging for patients.  Waiting lists for hospital care have ballooned in recent years, particularly since the 2012 decision.  I entirely agree with Ms Clyne that that decision was politically motivated and exceptionally damaging.  If the committee wishes to know why there are not enough consultants, it is as a result of policy decisions that were not evidence based or done in a collaborative way but, rather, imposed unilaterally.  The decisions were foolish, absolutely counter-productive and costly.  On every level, it was a gross error.  What worries me is that the errors and political thinking that led to that decision persists and we will probably not fix the problem unless we change the culture and thinking around how we fill those vacancies.<\/p> <p>  The number of outpatients waiting more than 12 months is a record 250,000.  There are 1 million people waiting for care in the public health service,  including approximately 840,000 on lists and 190,000 waiting for diagnostics such as CTs and MRIs.  More than 17,000 people are waiting more than a year for inpatient or day cases, compared with 131 awaiting such treatment in 2012 when the decisions to which I referred were made.<\/p><p>We have gone from 131 people waiting for over a year to 17,000.  It directly ties in with a really ill-advised policy decision.  One can see a clear cause and effect.<\/p><p> We have also had to recruit doctors who are not on the Medical Register.  There are 117 of these in the HSE by the last count.  That has been the result of adverse commentary in the High Court by Mr. Justice Peter Kelly and others.<\/p><p> What does it look like around the country?  We see in Cork that approximately 35% of acute trauma cannot be listed in orthopaedics because the hospital does not have consultants to do it.  In Cork and Kerry, there are the same number of ophthalmologists as there were in the late 1970s.  We are all aware of the issues there with regard to people having cataract surgery.  There are examples of this all around the country.  The single most significant determining factor is the decisions made in 2012, which have not been corrected and continue to perpetuate these issues.<\/p><p> As Ms Clyne said, and we completely agree, we have the lowest number of consultants in nearly every discipline in Europe.  That is a false dichotomy.<\/p><p> I want to specifically address our younger consultants, who are being discriminated against, as we have heard.  They carried an extremely heavy burden of work in the past seven months and will have to do that in future.  These are colleagues who we value greatly, and we, the health service and our people need more of them.  We need to treat them properly and encourage them to work in the health service.  That includes trainees in training schemes and higher specialist training, who want to be encouraged to come back.  I echo Ms Clyne's point on that.<\/p><p> We are borrowing much money and expanding the health service at pace.  We need the right people and we need to get them in rapidly and on terms they are happy to work on.  We need to see clarity about how many consultant posts will be funded and how they will be filled in a short period.  Some 16,000 additional staff are coming.  The committee has heard from my colleagues about how difficult it might be to fill positions in their disciplines and we agree.  It is the same for us.<\/p><p> To summarise, given the persistent shortfall of 500 posts, a clear conclusion is that the current offering is simply inadequate, in a broad sense.  That applies to all of the pay and conditions, including the flexibility that is needed to bring people in.  At this stage, most employers and organisations would conclude that maybe they need to engage with the people who are likely to fill these posts and improve their offering.  We will start with a blank sheet now.  I have been a consultant for 18 years.  This has not been the way things have been done or how business has been conducted, and that is why we now have a health service that does not have adequate capacity for our people.  We need to dramatically change the way that we recruit people.  There needs to be much more listening, action and implementation, to echo Ms Clyne's comments.<\/p><p> There is no time to lose.  Winter is coming.  We need to build for this winter and every future winter.  I will conclude my remarks there and, like the others, I would welcome and be happy to address questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Irvine","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":307,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.

Regarding the increase in the number of undergraduates, we are getting applicants from India and the Philippines.  What is the ratio of students from Ireland compared with non-EU countries?  We addressed retention of health staff at all levels in this committee in the last D&aacute;il.  It appears to be getting more difficult.  If so, are prevailing conditions the cause of the problem?

I am happy to take the first one first.  The question was why I said it was politically motivated.  We know what position the country was in in 2012.  We absolutely recognise the global financial crash and the implications that all of our people had to deal with.  There were mechanisms such as the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts that applied to every group in the public service.  In addition, in a vindictive and vicious way, one group was picked out, namely new consultants.  They had an extra 30% taken from them on top of every other group, in addition to the FEMPI cuts, so I am here to speak for them.  They felt that.  That really hurt people as well as being a financial issue.  They were told they were not valued.  The mood around this was horrible.  I remember it well.  It was depressing.  I am a pre-2012 consultant, so I do not have any financial issue with this personally, but I can see the damage that it has done to our health service and to colleagues.  People are being told that they are less valuable than their senior colleagues.  I believe that for all crafts, but in this case, I am talking specifically about our people.  It is damaging and the mood around it, the opinion pieces launched and the ugly soundbites that we heard in the media all created an incredibly damaging lack of value for new consultants and for people in training posts, looking at new consultant posts.  I tell anybody who wants to listen that that has been incredibly destructive, with op-eds, including one from Deputy Shortall in January 2012.  It was very damaging to people and how they would be valued.  These are the people who we are now asking to go the extra mile, put themselves on the front line and continue under these conditions.  I will finish because I want to give Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha time to speak.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Irvine"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":311,"content":"<p>In point 5 of our submission, we set out the statistics that we received from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland in 2019, which advised that 62% of newly-registered nurses and midwives trained outside Ireland.  That is the figure as we know it.  There are approximately 1,700 in training every year, which is the number of Irish graduates.<\/p><p>In addition, we also have nurses coming back to Ireland to register.  However, of those who registered, 62% had trained outside Ireland.  That will give the committee an idea of the numbers.<\/p><p> With regard to the increase in the numbers of undergraduates, we make the point simply because we will have a greater focus on the need for education.  We know the Minister with responsibility for higher education, in his new brief, is looking to expand opportunities for school leavers as Covid-19 will bring its own problems with employment.  If there are 5,000 people putting nursing or midwifery first on the Central Applications Office form, they should be accommodated, encouraged and funded to undertake the course.  There is a very real shortage and this is about supply and demand.  There is a request from school-leavers and we should accommodate it, encourage and applaud them.  We do not have to reinvent much but we must make a provision for them and ensure they can do it.<\/p><p> There are absolutely retention difficulties.  As Professor Irvine mentioned, if we remember as far back as 2012, nurses who graduated not only got the 10% pay reduction that all public servants got but they also got a further 20% reduction in their graduating pay scale.  In total they got a 30% pay cut and to a person they took that personally and emigrated.  We are now looking overseas to that group and saying \"Sure come home and we will treat you fine and better now\".  If they return, we give agency contracts rather than employment in the health service.  There are many fixable problems that currently make no sense.<\/p><p> Our recruitment practice is bureaucratic.  If I resign as a nurse today in hospital A, it will take a minimum of eight weeks for the director of nursing to get approval to go to advertisement and it would probably take approximately six months to fill the post.  It is pure bureaucracy at work but such tasks must be delegated to the director of nursing.  If there is a job and a person can continue to work, it should be up to that director to put that person on the payroll.  It must be that simple or otherwise we will continually fight against ourselves in order to recruit.<\/p><p> In 2012 and 2013, all the austerity measures were introduced and on 1 October public servants got the last of those cuts to pay restored, aside from the hours aspect.  Nurses in this country work a 39-hour week, a longer week than any other healthcare professional.  As a result, 1.5 hours per week is owed to them each week by their employer, which they currently work for nothing.  That is how they view it and it must be corrected in order to retain those staff.  I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.<\/p><p> On the broader matter of what can be done, we cannot provide both of these services into this winter.  We had over 100,000 people on trolleys last winter.  If we face that again while trying to provide care for people with Covid-19, we will fail.  It is simple enough.  The people who work in the health services are doing their best, from doctors to nurses to porters to cleaners and everybody else.  They are doing their best but they are human and exhausted.  We did a very intensive survey last week and the main message is that people are exhausted.  The citizens of this country understand the health service has limits but these are being reached and it will not be possible to provide both services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":313,"content":"<p>As we have run out of time with the slot, perhaps Senator Conway could come in later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#E00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":314,"content":"<p>I have one quick question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#E00300","speaker":"1644"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":315,"content":"<p>The Senator will have to wait for the next slot.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#E00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":316,"content":"<p>I will not be here for that.

They are contracted to work at rates between them and their employer.  We are seeking collective bargaining rights for that group of workers across the private sector.  If there is a rate of pay in a country, it should reflect the duties, and there should be equal pay for equal work.<\/p> <p>  In private nursing homes in particular we have a larger reliance on overseas nurses and there are difficulties in respect of where they live.  In many, although not all, cases there are examples of cost of accommodation being deducted from a salary.  Staffing levels are lower and it is more difficult to supervise work.  In many cases the ratio of nurse to patient is extraordinarily high and therefore dangerous.  These are very real issues.<\/p> <p>  The comment I made was in respect of an appeal not to \"poach\" private nursing home staff, although I may be misquoting.  My simple point is that if the conditions exist where workers are happy in an environment, they will stay there.  There would be no need to appeal to the State to block them from going for interviews in State-run facilities.  If the conditions are right, people will stay where they are for work.

I will come to Ms Clyne and Professor Irvine shortly regarding GPs, consultants and other specialties.  That is an area on which the committee should focus.

That is what people will ask.  We are heading into the winter season, and any winter is very challenging for the front line.  When are we likely to see the peak?  In a normal year, and we are not in a normal year, when would the peak be hit, and is she satisfied that when it is hit this year we have the capacity, resources and supports in place to ensure those on the front line can do the job they need to do?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00200","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":324,"content":"<p>It depends on what one is measuring.  What we measure normally is the hospital occupancy.  The hospitals are occupied at a rate that is much higher than the 82% or 83% which is considered safe all year round.  The peak does not happen like it used to, whereby there would be a reprieve during the summer.  That does not happen.  Our trolley count figures are increasing throughout the year but they get increasingly unmanageable in January and February, not so much in December although it is still very high.  January and February are months that become extremely difficult in the hospital setting.<\/p> <p>  In the community, it is important to examine the public health nursing support and the reduction in numbers there.  Those nurses tell us that the idea that they would have time to dedicate to geriatric surveillance, which was part and parcel of their role, is gone.  They do not have a facility to have waiting lists for their service so each day they must determine what is the priority.  They are not getting to massive areas because their numbers are insufficient.  That is a very big problem at a time like this when people are cocooning and we are trying to support the elderly to stay at home.

I wish to put questions to Ms Clyne and Professor Irvine.  I attended Professor Irvine's national conference last week and found all the contributions to be very interesting, but the issue of pay parity has arisen time and again.  This has been on the agenda for a long time.  There are 500 vacant consultant posts and unless we deal with the pay issue, we will not be able to attract consultants.  What I can understand from the Minister for Health is that he sees the public-only consultant contracts as the solution to this.  That would mean those who are on the type B contracts being asked to sign up to the Sl&aacute;intecare contracts.  In Professor Irvine's view, does that solve the problem?  If it does not, what else needs to be done?<\/p> <p>  The same question is addressed to Ms Clyne.  I also have a question for Ms Clyne regarding GPs.  We need more training positions to come through, but also better supports and pathways for GPs to practise when they come through.  The age demographic of GPs is obviously not good.  It is a major challenge.  Perhaps Ms Clyne will respond on the issue of GPs and ensuring there is a better pathway when they come from training to practise, and both witnesses will respond to the question of how we get more doctors and consultants into the system.  Aside from the pay issue, there are other issues relating to caseload, workload, access to theatre space, equipment and so forth.  Perhaps Professor Irvine will address those issues first, followed by Ms Clyne.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00400","speaker":"1615"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":326,"content":"<p>I will be very brief because Ms Clyne has not had a chance to speak and she has two questions to answer while I have just one.  On the question of the public-only contract, one of the reasons we are in this position is that we have a vision that is created centrally by employers that will \"solve the problem\".  It does not take cognisance of what the people who actually know what will solve the problem will say.  If this is another unilateral offer, it will not work.  Unilateral offers rarely do.  The public-only contracts will work for some disciplines and some people, depending on the conditions.  We have not seen those.  We are not in a negotiating space yet, nor is the IMO.  We are not involved in that yet.  We will negotiate things as we are allowed, but if there is a prefixed ideal from one side of where that should end, it probably will not solve the problems.<\/p> <p>  There are reasons that people want to retain freedom to work outside the public system, and they are not all financial.  Many of them are due to work satisfaction, having access to a list and perhaps being able to do a procedure one cannot do.  We are going to see procedures squeezed out of the public hospitals because of capacity issues.  We are already seeing the cancellation of routine work.  If one is a physician or a surgeon who does procedures, one wants to be able to keep the skills set in which one has invested heavily over the years in training, and perhaps one cannot express that in the public system.  Controlling every aspect of these senior professionals' lives, over and beyond what they discharge wholly in their public contracts, does not necessarily make good sense.  It will not fill all the gaps in the system.  We need a flexible approach, but we mainly need people to listen genuinely and not come with a prefixed idea.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Irvine"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":327,"content":"<p>I support what Professor Irvine said.  It is important to know that the Minister has committed several times, both in opposition and as Minister, to fixing the 30% pay cut.  The public health contract that has yet to be negotiated by either the IMO or the IHCA will not solve this issue.  In fact, it will drive more people away.  It must be remembered that there is currently a public-only contract on offer, and there has been since 2008, yet we have been unable to attract consultants on that contract.  The vast majority of consultants who have been contracted since 2008 have been on a type B contract.<\/p> <p>  If all private practice goes out of public hospitals, the public hospital system will be down by between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million per year.  The Department and policy makers must work with us, not against us, in trying to solve this problem.  However, the 30% must be fixed.  As in the point made by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha, recruiting doctors is a long-term process.  It can take from 20 months to two years to get a consultant into post.  We have identified the problems, and there are ways to fix them.  We have to start fixing them now.<\/p> <p>  With regard to GPs, there is a problem in general practice.  That has been highlighted for a number of years.  It is easy to predict how many GPs are going to retire and how many GPs we need to train.  If we fix those two issues, the gap is how we help younger GPs to establish.  Establishing a practice is not like walking into a State facility, where all one's costs are paid.  It is a business, and it is very costly.  There has been little predictability in GP income over the last number of years.  That is changing with the IMO agreement with the State, but there is little predictability about being able to say for sure what one's financial position will be given that the State controls a percentage of one's income without making any payment towards a percentage of one's costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":328,"content":"<p>I am sorry, Ms Clyne, but we have run out of time for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00700","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":329,"content":"<p>There are huge problems and there are ways to solve this if we talk to each other.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":330,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.

Therefore, that is the purpose of an independent investigative process, which in this country is the responsibility of the Health and Safety Authority.  In the event that someone dies from Covid-19, it is not a reportable death to the Health and Safety Authority if the person is a healthcare worker who acquired that infection at work.

I will concentrate on the issue of public health.  Probably before last March, very few people knew there was such a thing as public health.  From the point of view of prioritisation and resourcing in the health service, public health was exceptionally under-resourced.  If we have learned anything from the past seven or eight months, it must be that we must concentrate on public health, resource it properly and expand the capacity, because as it stands, it is very inadequate.  Regarding the point about which we were talking earlier with regard to the collapse of the tracing system, that is a result of inadequate resourcing of public health.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about those public health leaders at community level - public health nurses.<\/p><p>Public health nurses are often a very undervalued group of healthcare workers.  They are the people who have the expertise in child health, care of older people, vaccination programmes, chronic illness management in the community and so on.  Traditionally, it has been very underresourced.  There have been a lot of vacancies.  How adequate is the capacity of public health nursing now?  <\/p><p> I have a similar question relating to doctors for Ms Clyne.  She said that not only is the provision of public health specialists wholly inadequate relative to other countries but also that public health specialists, unlike their peers, do not have the opportunity to be consultants as there is no such grade in this country.  The Government indicated that it would address both of those points.  What is the status of that?  Ms Clyne said that 180 consultants were needed.  What is happening about creating the consultant posts and expanding them to the level required?<\/p><p> I have a question for Professor Irvine if there is time.  I would not disagree that serious mistakes were made in cutting consultant pay by 30%.  It was a real slap in the face to new recruits and has done much damage.  If he has time, will he tell us the other factors that discourage people from staying to practise in this country such as culture, career prospects and working conditions, which various surveys have told us discourage people from staying here after training?

The Deputy is correct about public health doctors.  People were very unaware of public health and all of a sudden the whole nation has become public health experts.  In 2003, around the time of SARS, public health specialists had to resort to industrial action.  We have 60, and it is a mainly female workforce, who are not consultants yet are expected to lead teams to deliver the care.  Recently we had a meeting with our public health members.  They unanimously decided that if the Department and the HSE did not progress this matter they would have no option but to take industrial action.  The Department and the HSE have both confirmed that they would address it, and the Minister confirmed that to the Covid committee.  However, we have not yet had an invitation to the Department for any serious talks.  These people are absolutely on their knees with exhaustion.  Most work seven hours a day, have little or no cover, and have very few support staff.   Both the winter plan and the budget anticipate that support staff will be hired in but there is no definitive commitment to award consultant contracts to the 60 people who are already there and at least increase the numbers to 85 immediately, increasing it to a similar level as Scotland or New Zealand over time.  These public health doctors, no more than other consultants, are like gold dust - every health system wants them.  Our people are being recruited into the UK, particularly Wales and Scotland, where they are told they can work for the NHS but do so from Dublin.  They will not have to leave Ireland while they work for another jurisdiction.  It is so galling for them.  They are managing all the outbreaks in every residential centre, in schools, in work places and they have to train up the contact tracing teams.  We have seen the problems that have arisen with contact tracing over the weekend.  There are just too few of these positions and way too much is being asked of them.  There is absolutely zero respect being shown to them.  Politicians, and many others, are busy thanking public health doctors, congratulating them on all their efforts, yet they are having no meaningful engagement with them to sort out this contractual issue which has been very long standing.  Furthermore, there are not enough trainees.  Career prospects for this specialty are so poor that there are not enough trainees in the system to match the numbers retiring out of the system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Shortall for her question on public health nursing.  The capacity report recommended that we increase the number of public health nurses by 700.  We are going backwards.  We have 40 fewer public health nurses now compared with December 2019.  We need to increase the training places and we need to greatly improve the circumstances of employment.  Community general nurses are supporting public health nurses in the community.  As I said, they do not have a facility for waiting lists but they tell us.  For example, they have responsibility from a new mother coming home with a baby, where they will make the first visit and undertake domiciliary care for a few weeks where they go into the home and provide the care.  They do the same for those who require palliative care, who have chronic disease and require management in the home, and they also run immunisation clinics and so on.  They have a very wide job description.<\/p> <p>  We are not training them in sufficient numbers.  Something we could do quickly would be to expand the training places.  There are 13 institutes of education in Ireland that provide undergraduate training but only four areas that provide public health nurse training.  Because it is a postgraduate qualification, people are established where they work.  There should be encouragement for people to go to their nearest educational institution and where they would be provided with postgraduate public health nursing education in all the 13 institutes of education, as well as undergraduate training.  That is something that is sensible and could be done quickly.<\/p> <p>  We should also encourage those who wish to access public health training.  We need to give them a break so that for those who have worked in the community and are familiar with how the community works, the time required on the public health nursing higher diploma would be reduced.  These are two small things that we think would assist immediately in increasing the numbers working in those categories.<\/p> <p>  Ms Clyne and others might also want to comment on structures.  We are being told that the HSE is restructuring the community.  Various committees are looking at how the community will be structures from the perspective of management and governance.  It is interesting that nursing is not being consulted largely in that.  Public health nurses and nurses who work in the community have made a massive contribution and will continue to do so.  We need to seriously look at how we align the managerial function and the community with the clinical responsibility and advice.

Those doctors are highly trained and highly motivated, but there seems to be a glass ceiling for them regarding career paths and achieving better prospects in the Irish health system.  Will the proposed change in the legislation under way in the Oireachtas, and which will be implemented in June 2021, make a difference to that set of doctors?  I ask that because the submission from the IMO referred to the major shortage of consultants in the Irish health system.

A better system is one where doctors move around countries to get enhanced training but then return to their home country to practise, in the majority of cases.  The WHO and the WMA, therefore, will state that this is an unethical practice anyway and that we are depriving other healthcare systems of much-needed health professionals.<\/p> <p>  That group of doctors who come here, however, do not really want to stay here because they have not been able to access the training posts.  While the recent legislation, therefore, is helpful in that it gives them some access, they are merely competing with a greater number of doctors now for the same number of training posts.<\/p><p>That move is not going to help with our medical manpower shortage in any way.  It will not make a jot of difference or fill one additional post.  Non-EEA and non-EU doctors have been treated very poorly.  They mainly emigrate from Ireland quite quickly because they are treated badly.  To see them as an answer to the consultant shortage would not be a correct interpretation of the situation.<\/p><p> Consider what we could have done since the Covid-19 pandemic, apart from all the normal planning based on previous reports.  In July of this year, several specialist registrars, SpRs, had finished their training and were ready to take consultant posts.  We asked the HSE to offer each and every one of them a temporary consultant contract.  This was denied.  We now have a situation where highly qualified and trained SpRs are working as registrars or are doing locum work.  It is an absolute disgrace.  We do not value any of our doctors, whether they are Irish-trained or non-EEA doctors.  We are very appreciative of all the work these doctors have done to prop up our health services, but it is wholly wrong and completely unethical to allow such an over-reliance on non-EEA doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#J01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Susan Clyne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":383,"content":"<p>I would like Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to comment on student nurses.

We have commented on student nurses already in this hearing, but it is important to state that we strongly believe that they are being exploited.  There is a shortage of nursing and midwifery grades.  Student nurses are now rostered for the clinical placement part of their training.  They are being used to fill gaps without pay.  It is as simple as that.  We strongly believe that payment is the very least they can expect.  We do not advocate unpaid work for anybody in our health service.  In the middle of a pandemic, when every other student in the country is being told to stay at home and take classes online, student nurses are being told to come in to work in these wards.  Not only are they not paid for that period, but that work costs them money.  Just like any other students, they usually have part-time jobs to supplement their incomes.  Once employers hear that an applicant is a student nurse working in an acute hospital they do not want him or her.  That is a secondary problem student nurses now face.<\/p> <p>  We do not want the situation in nursing to reach the point where these students have to leave.  They simply cannot afford to pay for accommodation in cities like Dublin or Cork, where most of the training places are located.  They work 12-hour shifts in many instances, with work expanding beyond the normal shift pattern.  I can find no other word but \"exploitation\".  We met representatives of the Department of Health last Friday and outlined these concerns.  We have appealed to the Minister and we have appealed to the public to support the student nurses in their campaign to get proper remuneration for what can only be described as work.  <\/p> <p>  The HSE figures indicate that 50 nurses are becoming infected each week.  That requires a period of absence of 14 days at a minimum.  Many nurses are telling us that the post-Covid-19 infection period can extend to 16, 17 or 18 days or even longer.  That creates a huge gap in the roster.  We must have proper occupational health facilities in place.  I am not talking about a free counselling helpline or a text message asking nurses if they are okay.  We are allowing health service staff who have been in close contact with patients to return to work if they are asymptomatic.  We know too much about this virus to risk that.  Not having a routine testing regime to accompany that policy creates a risk for others who come in contact with that person.  We have to test in acute hospitals and ensure that we identify asymptomatic cases.

North America and Australia are the really only relevant comparators.  That is where we tend to lead people.  One would need to break it down by region.  Certainly, the model in Australia is a very mixed, blended model.

Ultimately, this leads to those doctors having a problem in getting a consultant post because in order to get a consultant post one has to be a fully trained specialist.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of whether there are enough doctors in the system to fill vacancies in the consultant posts, if we were to increase the number of consultants to get to where we should be at, which is increasing the number of consultants by about 2,000, the answer is \"No\".  This is because these doctors, unfortunately, have not been able to get the certifications to be able to take on these posts.  As Susan said earlier, there is also a massive ethical problem with countries in the western developed world continually relying on importing healthcare staff, specifically doctors who are being trained in the developing world where we know there are huge heath needs.  The solution here is that we need to have more training places overall; allow those training places to be open competition for doctors, irrespective of what country they trained in; and, increase the numbers of doctors we train in the State so that for every doctor who takes an Irish training post there would be an Irish doctor taking a training post in another country.<\/p> <p>  The history of medicine has always relied on doctors travelling to different countries either for training posts or for long-term posts for that cross-pollination of ideas and academics.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#L00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Matthew Sadlier"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Sadlier.

General practice is a mix of public and private and, therefore, the independent contractor model is what works best.  It delivers well and has huge satisfaction ratings.  The younger GPs, however, are not being supported.  The surveys will show that many young GPs do not want to take on the responsibilities of running a business immediately on completing their training.  As they progress through their careers, they become more inclined to do so and are happier to do so.  At the point at which they have just completed training, they need to be able to go into an established practice to get a feel for how things are and to be supported in that practice.

While I was aware of the pressure on our health workers, I have learned a great deal today about just how bad that pressure is and about how indebted we are to our front-line workers.  Thanks are important but they are just not enough.  If gratitude is to be given meaning it should lead to an overdue reassessment of who we value most in society and how we treat them.  It should not take a pandemic to expose how poorly paid, insecure and badly treated many healthcare workers are.  Society cannot function without them.<\/p> <p>  I have one question in addition to making that point.  In Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's submission, I read that research has shown that front-line hospital staff and other key workers have a higher chance of experiencing mental health difficulties during the pandemic.  We know the Covid-19 pandemic has created stressful working environments for many people.  I want to again highlight the disgraceful treatment of student nurses who are exposed the dangers of Covid-19 without any payment at all.  This must be corrected.  <\/p> <p>  I also have a question for Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  It relates to the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals, particularly nurses.  What supports are needed to address this problem?  I thank all of the groups represented for their fantastic work in looking after the most vulnerable in our society.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#M00900","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>We surveyed our members very recently.  I do not believe they are out of kilter with healthcare workers throughout the world.  The response rate was very high at nearly 3,000 and nearly 82% of the respondents said that Covid-19 has had a negative impact on their mental health.  That is not surprising.  It is consistent with the findings of other nursing unions across the globe with which we tic-tac all of the time.<\/p> <p>  The World Health Organization, WHO, says that exposure time must be reduced.  In other words, if I work on a Covid ward, I need to be relieved from work on such a ward and from constantly wearing personal protection equipment, PPE, and to be assured of sufficient rest time to recover before coming back in to face it again.  That is not happening because we are very short-staffed.  We know of instances of nurses across all age groups from students to those who are very close to retirement who must wear PPE constantly for periods of six hours before getting a break for hydration.  One of the simplest things to do is to ensure that nurses finishing a tour of duty have a set period of time, paid for by the employer, to provide relief and to ensure they can look after their own physical and mental health.  This is a very difficult environment.  One gets very warm when wearing PPE.  It is very restrictive.  <\/p> <p>  Nurses, doctors, speech and language therapists and all other healthcare workers are doing their best to be innovative with regard to communicating with clients.  It is amazing what healthcare workers have done in trying to communicate and get messages across to patients who are intellectually disabled right across the sector, from acute hospitals to community settings and long-term care.  One of the things coming across is exposure to lonely patients.  I refer to patients in the community, particularly the elderly in nursing homes, who no longer receive visitors.  The healthcare workers are now doubling up as their main mental and moral support.  That is fine if a centre has enough staff to provide the required time but staff are feeling guilty because they do not have enough time to spend with these patients.  Of course, there is mental anguish.  We hope not to see a staffing crisis that is even worse than it was going into the pandemic.  We can do things to prevent that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2020102100002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":406,"content":"<p>May I jump in on this?  As I have said, I work as a psychiatrist within the public hospital system.  The pandemic has exposed significant gaps in our mental health services.  The percentage of our total budget we spend on psychiatry is one of the lowest in the world.  I echo what Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has said.  By profession, I am an old-age psychiatrist.  My day job involves me going in and out of nursing homes and visiting people at home.  Isolation and loneliness has been a very significant issue during this pandemic, especially for the elderly.  I welcome the introduction of the concept of the support bubble within the level 5 restrictions.  It was a very good late addition and may help to offset some of the problems we saw during the first wave of the pandemic.<\/p> <p>  We need better integration of community psychiatry and acute hospital mental health care.  The division of psychiatry out into the community comes with the side-effect of reducing the supports available to the general hospital system in places.  This needs to be seriously thought about.  Liaison psychiatry, the special type of psychiatry in hospitals, needs to be better resourced because not only does it provide care to patients within the hospital, but having a good and well-resourced liaison psychiatry department within a hospital provides a resource for the staff of the hospital.  It is able to look at matters such as psychological first aid, a programme we ran in the Mater hospital in Dublin, and other such initiatives to support staff.

What changes do the witnesses want to see with regard to specialist registrars and their training, as well as junior doctors?  I would appreciate a written reply on the changes they would make in order to assist people who are in that category.  There also seems to be a lack of understanding around consultant contracts.  A lot of people do not understand that a lot of consultants under contract are on a one-in-three or one-in-four rota.  That means that they work all day, every day, five days a week and are on call every third or fourth night as well as being on call every third or every fourth weekend.  There are even consultants on one-in-two rotas.  There is a lack of understanding among the public about that.<\/p> <p>  The other issue that we need to understand is that under the current category B and category C contracts consultants, who number about 2,000, have about 2 million appointments per year outside of their work for the HSE or within the public system.  If there are 3.5 million outpatient appointments annually, this means that if we bring everything into the public sector, we will have to see a huge expansion very quickly.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I want to raise is the challenges facing GP trainees.  As I understand it, there are currently around 5,000 GP vacancies in the UK.  The IMO referred to the fact that the training of doctors needs to be modernised.  Could we get a written submission on what modernisation is being referred to here?  I ask them to include a response on the number of additional GP training places we need.

I would welcome a brief response on that.<\/p> <p>  I have a question for Ms Clyne on international recruitment.  I have recently been helping an individual who I do not want identify, except to say that he would be a key individual to recruit into the Irish system, but have come up against a barrier which has not been mentioned today, namely problems with securing a visa from the Department of Justice and Equality so that his family can accompany him here.  He has a young family and will not come here until they can come too so because of an administrative delay, patients are losing out.  My point is that there are barriers other than those already referred to by the witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Hanly report identified the need for 3,600 consultants by 2013 but now the estimated requirement is approximately 4,500.  One can make an analogy with premiership soccer.  There was a time when a decent soccer player would play for any club and be proud to do so but now players only want to play for the London clubs and northern English football has suffered as a result.  There is something quite similar happening with consultants in Ireland.  They do not want to come west of the Shannon.  Endocrinologists, neurologists and all of the other specialists needed west of the Shannon in places like Ennis and University Hospital Limerick are not coming.

As a result, from time to time, I will make a distinction between the budget planned for core services and investment, and additional funding provided in two areas, namely, emergency Covid funding and the July stimulus 2020 funding.  The reason for this is to make a distinction between the general trend of services, investment in the budget and temporary expenditure that, to a large degree, will be unwound in the coming years, once the crisis eventually abates.<\/p> <p>  In addition, the endpoint of Britain&rsquo;s trade negotiations with the EU is fast approaching.  We will learn what the UK&rsquo;s post-Brexit relationship will be with the EU for the foreseeable future.  This continues to present the risk of an additional transport crisis, impacting principally on the aviation and road haulage sector.  Once again, as we approach a Brexit deadline, interconnectivity will be at stake and we need to be prepared for the impact of the outcome of trade negotiations on aviation, road haulage, the land bridge, as well as the export and import of goods to the island.<\/p> <p>  My Department has diligently worked on these matters throughout 2020 at three different levels.  These are: ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity priorities form part of the EU negotiating mandate; working with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure the European Commission is fully aware of Ireland&rsquo;s contingency needs should a deal not materialise; and putting our readiness preparations in place for 1 January.  All this is being done, despite the greater crisis represented by battling Covid 19.<\/p><p>Today's set of transport Estimates provide an overall gross allocation to the Department of Transport of over &euro;3.05 billion.  We are using the funding to provide ongoing services, protect services that are impacted by the Covid-19 emergency and to continue to invest in maintaining existing infrastructure, as well as continuing to develop new infrastructure with a focus on climate change.<br\/><br\/>This funding for 2020 represents a &euro;1 billion<b><\/b>increase on our investment levels for 2019, of &euro;2.045 billion.<b><\/b>Each of the Department's three programmes share the funding to some degree with the bulk going to the land programme. <br\/><br\/>In line with the Central Exchequer guidance in advance of the 2020 budget, the Department had prudently stayed largely within its existing level of expenditure for current expenditure.  Of the three programmes, aviation, land and maritime, there had been a small increase in investment in national roads maintenance with &euro;8 million secured in the budget and an additional &euro;1.2 million in public service obligation funding for public transport, to support the transport requirements for Ireland's share of matches in the Euro 2020 finals.<br\/><br\/>Capital increased from &euro;1.844 million to &euro;1.981 million, which is more or less in line with the profiled capital ceiling for 2020 as set out in the five-year capital ceilings underpinning Project 2040.  The Department reprofiled &euro;125 million<b><\/b>from its capital ceiling, without affecting progress on planned projects for 2020, to assist the Exchequer reach a balanced budget.  At the start of 2020, early indications and expenditure returns for the first two months of the year showed expenditure largely on track, with an underspend in the PSO budget, in particular, indicating that fare revenue was still rising in PSO services, although it was forecast by the National Transport Authority to plateau as the year progressed and services reached maximum capacity on the public transport network.<br\/><br\/>The advent of the Covid-19 crisis and the commencement of a lockdown on 12 March had an immediate impact on public transport services.  Public health guidelines meant that capacity was restricted on public transport to 25% of the maximum capacity and it rose to 50% when the initial phase of the crisis had passed.  The impact on fare revenue and the cost of PSO services to run the transport network was immediate.  The National Transport Authority estimated that a shortfall of &euro;460 million would emerge before the end of the year.  As the allocation for PSO for 2020 was &euro;303 million this meant the prospect of the entire PSO budget, which constitutes 54% of the Department's total current budget, would be spent by July.  On 4 June, based on the advice of the National Transport Authority and the Department, the Government sanctioned an additional allocation of &euro;460 million for public service obligation expenditure.<br\/><br\/>The crisis has had an impact in three other areas - commercial bus services; maritime transport services; and the refund and repatriation of travellers.  Commercial bus services suffered the same impact as PSO providers and to such a degree that their viability was threatened.  The Government decision of 24 June approved up to an additional &euro;100 million in funding on a temporary six-month basis.  The 2020 tranche is being drawn down from the main emergency PSO allocation.<br\/><br\/>The collapse in passenger numbers also affected ferry services.  Ferry services do not just carry ferry passengers.  They are also key transporters of goods and cargo and are an integral part of our national supply chains.  The collapse in passenger numbers threatened the viability of the combined passenger and freight services, in turn threatening the stability of the supply chains.  In response, on 7 April, the Government sanctioned &euro;15 million in PSO support to certain key ferry companies to assist the companies through the crisis.<br\/><br\/>The crisis has severely impacted the aviation sector.  One of the earliest manifestations of stress in the sector was in the tour operator market that although not strictly an Aviation matter is, in practice, bound up heavily in aviation through flight bookings as part of holiday packages.  Under the EU Directive 2015\/2302 passengers are entitled to a refund for packages and the cost of repatriation to Ireland.  The Government sanctioned &euro;15 million to meet the costs of repatriating or refunding customers affected by the collapse of the tour operator businesses.<br\/><br\/>As well as the emergency funding that I have outlined, the Government sanctioned additional funding as part of the July stimulus package.  Additional capital formed the bulk of the stimulus with the Department receiving &euro;113.5 million in capital and &euro;2 million in current funds.  The capital was targeted at ready-to-go projects in line with the Department's overall investment strategies with a jobs rich component.  The current expenditure was used to finance the commencement of additional bus services.<br\/><br\/>In addition to the emergency funding that I have outlined, my Department continues to provide essential ongoing maritime and aviation services, and invest significant funds in road, aviation and maritime safety.  My Department is also a key driver of Project 2040.  Despite the current crisis we cannot lose sight of the long-term strategic priorities represented by Project 2040.  Indeed, one positive development in 2020 is that there has been little substantive delay to many major projects already under construction, despite the shutdown of construction sites at the height of the lockdown.<br\/><br\/>Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role played by our ports and airports in the  international connectivity of our island nation.  The importance of interconnectivity and reliance on interconnectivity have been starkly highlighted by the crisis.<br\/><br\/>Project 2040 is very focused on moving towards a fundamental transformation on how people work, live and move in an environmental context through a better integration of towns and cities, and more sustainable forms of transport.  I have intensified this focus since my appointment as Minister of State.  The Department has a number of sustainable transport projects within its remit that are funded in 2020, particularly BusConnects, DART Plus and Metrolink.  These projects, alongside the replacement of existing diesel buses and commuter trains with hybrid models, will see a steady move away from modes of transit that rely on carbon based fuels and too reliant on the private car to a public transport system that is capable of being powered by renewable sources of energy.  Of course, public transport accounts for less than 5% of land transport CO<sub>2<\/sub>emissions.  That is why my Department actively promotes the growth of electric vehicles or EVs in the private car market.<br\/><br\/>I will briefly go through the three programmes of investment within my Department, and the funding levels and plans for 2020.<br\/><br\/>Programme A is civil aviation.  During 2020 direct investment in aviation will be roughly &euro;52 million or over 1.7% of expenditure in my Department.  Much of the work we do in this programme involves working with regulators and international partners.  The international commercial nature of air travel means that my Department's involvement in investments focuses mainly on regional access.  Regional airports have faced particular stresses in 2020.  Therefore, the key priority for investment in the aviation programme over the short to medium term is to support the regional airports and ensure their continued viability.<br\/><br\/>In 2020, the regional airports programme was allocated &euro;22.3 million.  Steps have been taken in the 2021 budget to provide further support.  A sum of &euro;10.2 million was allocated to cover costs associated with our membership of EUROCONTROL, and cover costs incurred by the Irish Aviation Authority for certain services and subscriptions to international organisations.<br\/><br\/>The 2020 Estimates in the aviation programme also contain a new budget line not present in the 2019 Estimates, with &euro;15 million allocated for the repatriation or refund of passengers affected by the collapse of tour operators.<br\/><br\/>Programme B is the land transport, which is by far the largest programme in my Department's Vote and representing 94% of our overall budget.  This year, the allocation will increase by over &euro;599 million or 26% to &euro;2.9 billion.  Most of the increase is a step-up in investment in our roads and mass transit services.  The main components of the programme are: public service provision payments at &euro;766 million, PSO; roads improvement and maintenance funding with an overall budget of just over &euro;1 billion; &euro;115.250 million in additional funding that was allocated as part of the July stimulus funding; the public transport investment programme at &euro;805 million; and the active travel programme that constitutes Smarter Travel measures of cycling, walking and greenways at &euro;128.6 million, which constitutes &euro;76.6 million in initial funding and supplemented by &euro;52 million from the July stimulus package; the provision of &euro;7.750  million towards the carbon reduction programme; the operating costs of the national vehicle driver licensing system at just under &euro;22 million, which is a system that helps us to collect motor taxes and fees such as toll fees on the M50; and &euro;81 million is provided for the main investment agencies of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA.<br\/><br\/>Next is public transport, programme B.  The most significant current expenditure allocation is &euro;766 million to public transport PSO funding.<\/p><p>We will continue to support strongly the delivery of these socially necessary but financially unviable services throughout the country.  This constitutes &euro;306 million in existing level of service funding for 2020 and &euro;460 million in emergency funding to meet the cost of the reduction in fare revenue.  As the NTA forecasts that not all the &euro;460 million will be required in 2020, a portion of the funding is sanctioned to support key services provided by commercial bus companies on a temporary six-month basis.<\/p><p> In 2020, we again allocated investment to protect the quality and value of our existing public transport networks.  The &euro;200 million in funding being made available in 2020 to Irish Rail in its role as infrastructure manager continues to be at the steady-state level as measured on an annual basis.<\/p><p> We have commenced the transition to a hybrid bus fleet as part of the ongoing fleet replacement programme.  We are progressing plans to expand and upgrade the rail fleet, the commuter element of which will also commence a transition to dual battery or electric in the coming years.<\/p><p> The expansion of capacity on the Luas is well advanced, with 26 tram extensions planned for 2020 and eight new trams purchased.  We continue to guide BusConnects, MetroLink, and DART plus through the planning and design process.  We are also committed to ongoing retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to improve their accessibility features.  Accessibility is built into new projects and new assets as part of the integral design.<\/p><p> We have provided significant funding for active travel measures, greenways and dedicated urban cycleways.  We have utilised the July stimulus funding element to support active travel measures throughout the country.  Some of this funding has been used by local authorities to introduce wider pavements and new cycle lanes to provide alternative means of sustainable transport, given the reduced capacity on the public transport network.  Additionally, rural transport services that respond to local needs have also increased and we have provided an additional &euro;2 million in funding for the launch of new services in 2020. <\/p><p> We continue to target new and innovative ideas to help decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low-emission technologies and incentives to encourage the national taxi fleet towards greener fuels and private car drivers towards electric vehicles, EVs.  We have provided &euro;1.5 million in funding to support the introduction of more EV charge points at transport hubs nationwide and &euro;250,000 in July stimulus funding to provide EV grants to local taxi service providers.<\/p><p> Approximately &euro;1.128 billion is available for the roads improvement and maintenance programme.  With this we will continue to provide grant support for the national, regional and local road networks.  This investment will be used to maintain and renew the national, regional and local road surfaces, with the total network being 99,000 km; meet our contractual obligations under public private partnerships that delivered parts of our motorway network; maintain motorways in safe and usable conditions; undertake safety works, and bridge maintenance and rehabilitation; carry out improvement schemes throughout the country on some minor roads; and undertake essential routine maintenance such as signing and lining, verge maintenance and preparatory winter maintenance.<\/p><p> With our partners in Transport Infrastructure Ireland and various local authorities, we are progressing a number of major Project Ireland 2040 projects during the course of 2020, including the Coonagh-Knockalisheen distributor road; the Westport to Turlough road; the N8 Dunkettle scheme which will commence construction; and the Sligo western distributor road.  There is also additional funding in the July stimulus to undertake climate proofing on our roads.<\/p><p> Road safety is of paramount importance and our support for the operations of the Road Safety Authority and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety will continue.  There are significant driver theory testing and driver testing backlogs at the Road Safety Authority due to the shutdown in the spring, with social distancing measures being an additional complication for the driving test.  We are continuing to monitor the situation in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority.  The Road Safety Authority is primarily self-financed and is continuing to meet its statutory obligations without requiring support funding in 2020.<\/p><p> In the maritime area, other essential safety investments that we make as a Department are seen across the work of the Irish Coast Guard.  They are funded through our maritime transport and safety programme, programme C.  Funding for the maritime programme in 2020 is at &euro;118 million or 4% of the Vote.  Most of that funding is directed to the Irish Coast Guard and the main cost here relates to the search and rescue helicopter contract.  The programme also funds the Commissioners for Irish Lights which operate buoys and lighthouses, and keep seafarers and their cargoes safe while in Irish waters.  We also cover various administrative costs associated with the Irish Maritime Administration.  It is also important to note that we will be continuing the Coast Guard building programme to ensure that the volunteers have adequate facilities for their operations and equipment, and we are investing in IT infrastructure to enable the teams to enhance further how they work together.<\/p><p> An additional line with &euro;15 million in funding has been added to the 2020 Revised Estimates Volume to provide temporary public service obligation, PSO, support to ferry companies and ensure that supply chains are protected.  I now expect that only a third of this funding will be required in 2020 and additional funding is not required as being forecasted in 2021.<\/p><p> In 2020, we will have built on progress of recent years.  We will push our transport and communication strategies forward.  We will continue to build and prepare for construction of a more mobile and connected country.  We will continue to provide necessary support to alleviate pressure in public transport arising from the Covid-19 crisis.  We will monitor supply and demand in the transport network closely to generate up-to-date forecasts, based on ongoing public health measures.  We will place increased emphasis on the importance of active travel and on improving pedestrian and cycling facilities throughout the country.<\/p><p> I am more than happy to answer any questions on the 2020 Estimate of expenditure and investment for the services provided by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#A00400","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":428,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for being available on the fringe of D&aacute;il sittings to answer some of our questions.

In the 2021 budget we allocated &euro;21.3 million to our regional airports along with the &euro;10 million the Deputy mentioned, which is capital funding.<\/p><p>Airports will be asked to make applications to the Department for that capital funding.  Obviously, we have put supports in place for the workers who have been severely affected by the news of Ryanair pulling its bases from Cork and Shannon airports.  I have been in discussions with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, about contacting the local welfare offices as well.  It is important to say that.<\/p><p> As the committee knows, at the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday we agreed to align ourselves with the EU traffic light system.  We had an agreement at Cabinet this week on that approach and we will be coming back on it.  There will be a high-level technical group within Departments monitoring it every two weeks.  From midnight tonight, there will be no restrictions for travellers from a green list country travelling to Ireland.  Many countries across Europe, including us, are on a red list.  For orange and red list countries, we are asking people to restrict their movements for 14 days, as is currently the case for all travellers.  For orange list countries, there will be an exemption from restricting movements if the person carries out a validated pre-departure test.  The requirement for red list countries remains as it is at the moment and people will have to restrict their movements.<\/p><p> The high-level technical group will be looking at and assessing the types of testing we can carry out.  As we know, the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test is the gold standard.  There is also work ongoing on other potential types of testing that could become available or be validated in the future.  We want to leave that open in order that we could potentially use that for pre-departure tests.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#C00700","speaker":"1578","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":435,"content":"<p>I spoke about this matter in the D&aacute;il last night with the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne.  One of the Europe-wide failings of the traffic light system is that there is no uniformity in how amber and red regions are being treated.  Incoming passengers in France will be treated quite differently from how we will treat them.  Passengers must grapple with that, but from an airline's point of view there is uncertainty across the European Union regarding scheduling flights into spring 2021 and beyond.  There are also measures lacking beyond the Union.  We are very reliant in the mid-west on Shannon Airport and flights coming in from the US.  There does not seem to have been any in-depth discussion about reactivating that air connectivity westbound to the United States.  That is something that urgently needs to happen.<\/p> <p>  I will make a brief comment on rail, in which I see there is to be major investment.  I spoke to one of the Minister of State's colleagues, Deputy Matthews, last week over tea break.  He is a huge advocate of rail travel but I made the point to him that it is unaffordable for many people.  I would love to take the train to Dublin every day but it is simply not affordable.  The car is probably half the price.  Pricing must be tackled.  I lived in Belgium and the Czech Republic for a year, split on a six-month basis, and I could travel 300 km or 400 km by rail for &euro;12 or &euro;15.  It was very viable and that is what really got people using it.  It has to make economic sense.<\/p> <p>  The other point I wish to touch on is the Coonagh to Knockalisheen distributor road in County Clare, which is a phased project.  Phase 1 is getting under way, but phase 2 was not mentioned in budget 2021.  Many questions are being asked about it in the region.  It will be an information highway between Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, which will get university status in March 2021, and the University of Limerick, UL, campus.

Regarding what was announced in budget 2021, the first phase will be under construction next year.

However, there is a backlog and many Deputies have been in contact with the Department about it.  Due to health protocols, we had to shut down driver testing in February.  There are health concerns about someone sitting in someone else's car, which is an uncontrolled environment, so we had to reduce the number of driving tests taking place every day.  I have been assured this is an essential service and we will be prioritising essential workers getting tests and licences.

There is a lot of sanitisation.  I have been contacted by a number of instructors dealing with a number of testing centres and I just want to raise it as an issue.

As the Minister of State said, PCR is the standard.  That work has been done by HIQA.  It will present that work and may already have submitted it to the Government.  It seems clear that at present, PCR is the main viable option.  HIQA suggests that we should move to clinical validation in the appropriate settings, so ports and airports in our case.  Has the Minister of State received that report from HIQA?  Is it under consideration?  Are we in a position to move towards clinical validation for PCR departure testing at our ports and airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#D00900","speaker":"1507","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>It is important to mention our ports too, which will need to have these testing facilities.  PCR is recognised by the Department of Health as the standard test.

To answer the Deputy's questions, there is a range of tests such as antigen tests and LAMP tests.  Work has been done on validating those.  We have to work with the Department of Health to validate those, so it is not just the Department of Transport working on those.  It also includes the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  It is a cross-governmental approach.  We have to ensure that we are not impacting on the PCR capacity of the country's health system.

It is important to say that even if there is a deal about this, there will be disruption at the UK land bridge.  We call on businesses and the industry to investigate direct routes to the Continent.  There are existing direct ferry routes to the Continent.  I have been told by the shipping industry that routes are available, reliable and have capacity.

It is very welcome to see the increase in the Minister of State's departmental budget, which is a significant increase from budgets before.<\/p><p>It is reassuring to see the focus on investment in public transport.  As a country, we planned around cars for the past 40 or 50 years.  As such, we have ended up in circumstances in which there is major congestion and urban sprawl, at least before Covid.  Emissions from transport have been spiralling upwards and we have had air quality issues in our towns, cities and villages.  It is no wonder that we get this if we plan for it for 40 or 50 years.<\/p><p> Our current focus is Covid related, which is correct, but we must also think forward to a time when we will be Covid free, which I believe will happen.  I do not know when it will be but that is what we are all working towards.  Investment in public transport takes time.  Capital investment is required and projects take time to design and to get up to speed.  Land acquisition may be required.  It is timely that we are aiming this budget towards public transport investment.<\/p><p> Let me move on to some of the transport areas.  Rural bus services were touched on earlier.  Deputy Cathal Crowe mentioned the Expressway service.  It is critical that we provide options to people in smaller towns and villages so they can leave the car behind.  It will never be possible to provide a service with a ten-minute frequency, as BusConnects could for a highly populated area, but it is still necessary to provide a service that is attractive and offers an alternative to driving a car.  It opens up options for employment, recreation and education.  Someone who lives in a town or village does not have to be car dependent if there is a bus service in the morning.<\/p><p> In the Minister of State's statement, she mentioned investment to maintain the steady state on the railways.  We need to have a higher ambition, whereby, instead of maintaining the steady state, we improve frequencies and levels of service and give people more options.  Therefore, we have to up our game.  There are towns in my constituency, such as Tinahealy and Rathnew, where people are forced to own a car if they want to get to work in the nearest population centre, such as Gorey or Arklow.  That adds a cost.  In this regard, consider the argument that a service must be pulled if it is no longer viable.  If a service is made so unattractive and unreliable that it is not an alternative, it is of no use and will not be used.  If appropriate services are provided, people will use them.<\/p><p> Let me move on to the urban transport brief.  It is positive to see the investment in the budget for BusConnects.  It is an important project for the greater Dublin area.  It will increase frequency.  It gives options in that it will reconfigure the bus service into orbital and radial routes, which we should have done a long time ago.  It would have been quite easy to do because it just means changing bus routes around.  There is now an option whereby a passenger does not need to go into the city centre to get back out again.  For example, a passenger going from Bray to Tallaght does not have to go into the city centre and back out again.  I am happy, therefore, to see BusConnects proceed and the investment in it.<\/p><p> With regard to active travel and transport, it is really positive to see the increased budget.  There is a huge desire for active travel.  Every person in the room will have seen the uptake in cycling during the Covid period as a result of a reduction in capacity on public transport.  People have come to realise that there are routes on which they can cycle to work or to recreational facilities.  They recognise all the options that exist.<\/p><p> The investment in greenways is welcome.  We should regard greenways not only as tourist attractions or as infrastructure for people who might want to go to a county for a week or two on holidays but also as attractive commuter links from town to town, especially where they are off-road and provide safe, segregated infrastructure.  I am delighted to see the investment in greenways.<\/p><p> Safer Routes to School is a related matter.  Most children would like to be able to cycle or walk to school safely.  In the 1970s and 1980s, many more children were walking and cycling to school.  Much of the time nowadays, it is unsafe to do so.  When I get the opportunity to walk my own children to school in the morning - I am fortunate to live within walking distance of a school - my heart is in my mouth looking at children struggling through traffic and at roads we have given over to cars and not given over fairly to other forms of transport that are healthier.  I am delighted to see the investment in these.<\/p><p> The Minister of State mentioned the investment in the Luas.  It has been a massive success.  I am glad to see the investment in the additional, longer carriages.  A number of Luas projects are in the design and feasibility stages.  We should actively pursue these.  The existing Luas lines have been very successful and are absolutely jammed at commuter times.  It is a little uncomfortable but I suppose this is an indication of success.  Public transport should be busy.  It is an indication that it is well designed and functioning.  It should not be half empty.  There are a number of routes on which I really hope to see progress.  The Luas route to Bray has been talked about for so long.  It is dependent on a metro south upgrade.  A Luas to Finglas is another viable concept, as is the DART+ proposal.  Electrification to Drogheda and, I hope, beyond, and also to Hazelhatch and Maynooth, makes perfect sense.  These are major commuter growth areas.  Before Covid, the roads to these locations were absolutely jammed.  Commuters should be given the opportunity to use an electrified rail route.  It can add capacity.  More trains can be put on the line and there is better acceleration and braking capability.  As we move from diesel-dependent units to electrified units, it will obviously fit very well with our desire to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.<\/p><p> I suggested to the National Transport Authority, NTA, two or three years ago that it look further south.  Many of the transport objectives in its strategy were focused on the north and west and did not seem to focus much on the south.  I asked the authority about the electrification of the lines from Greystones to Wicklow.  Wicklow is set to grow under the regional transport strategy.  I will continue to engage with the Department on that to examine the feasibility of electrification to Wicklow.<\/p><p> I have spent all my time welcoming where the investment is going.  It is positive, which needs to be noted.  With regard to electric vehicles, there seems to be a massive desire in Ireland to purchase larger vehicles, such as SUVs and crossovers.  They are expensive.  An electric crossover model costs &euro;40,000 to &euro;50,000.  There are perfectly good, adequate smaller electric vehicles that can be obtained at a much more affordable price.  Will the Minister of State consider incentivising the purchasing of smaller, more affordable adequate vehicles rather than the bigger, more fashionable ones that may not be required, especially in urban areas?  I understand fully that there is a need for SUVs and 4x4s and rural areas.  In urban areas, they are totally unnecessary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#F01400","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":467,"content":"<p>I concur that the rolling out of public transport and sustainable mobility is crucial.  We have seen a great example of greater buy-in during the Covid period, when we have all been locked down.  We have noted the importance of safe walking and cycling routes.  This relates to the Safer Routes to School programme, which is under my remit.  It is not just about safe routes to school but also about safe routes within rural towns and villages.  It is important to get the message across that this is not just an urban or city initiative.<\/p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I started straight off the bat, through the July stimulus, by asking local authorities to identify shovel-ready projects within their towns, villages and cities.  We provided significant funding in this regard.  The initiatives are now being rolled out and will be completed by the end of November.  It was a challenge for the local authorities because some of them were probably taken by surprise by the significant funding.  They had to grapple to try to get the works done.  I would like to see a multi-annual programme allowing the local authorities to plan, over a number of years, for the rolling out of walking and cycling infrastructure across their areas.<\/p><p>When I meet local councillors, I ask them to identify the areas in their own local authority areas that need to be invested in.  It is only through our local councillors as well as the executive within the local authorities across the country that we can identify and spearhead these initiatives.  I know the goodwill when local communities get a safe footpath or cycleway.  We need to look at the safe routes to schools outside our school settings and this is where the schools need to work directly with the local authorities.  I appeal to local authorities to work on this because the funding will be there and there are health benefits, which the Deputy mentioned.  The cycle buses going to schools, which we have in my constituency of Galway West, are so effective and an advertisement in themselves.  We do not want a cycle bus but just that children can cycle safely on cycle routes to school eventually, so they do not need these organised cycle buses, though they are fantastic.<\/p><p> The rural transport programme now operates under LocalLink.  The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally.  There are 15 LocalLink offices around the country and they manage the delivery of that service on behalf of the NTA.  They are critical in our rural towns and villages to ensure we have connectivity for employment and health services, and access to social and educational opportunities.

As she is aware, this committee has put front and centre of its initial work the issue of testing and getting our aviation sector ready for when safe and increased travel can happen, when, hopefully, our part of the world can knock the pandemic back.  I am encouraged by some of the Minister of State's words today.  She mentioned it is a good time to start planning for this testing regime.  The aviation task force reported in July recommending a testing regime and we have lost that time but Deputy Naughton is the first Minister or Minister of State who has spoken in the Chamber or in committee who seems proactively ready to move forward on this, which is encouraging.  I ask that it be moved forward as quickly as possible.  This six-week period, as difficult as it is going to be, provides an opportunity when we come out of it for the aviation industry to have this regime in place.  This is the missing piece for those involved.  The Minister of State said their one request was to protect connectivity but they know they need a testing regime to do that.  She said many countries are grappling with the provision of it.  Many of them are no longer grappling and have already provided it.  We are hoping to welcome next week an individual who assisted Rome airport in rolling out a pretty good testing regime.  I hope the Minister of State and her officials will tune in and listen to that.  Much has been and will be said on the matter, but it has to be acknowledged that the Minister of State's briefing and opening statement sets out a great deal of money and investment.<\/p> <p>  On the PSO for public transport, the Minister of State stated that &euro;766 million, which is an eye-watering figure, is available for PSO services throughout the country to ensure such services remain viable given the challenges of a 50% reduction in maximum capacity.  With the move to level 5, public transport goes to 25% of capacity.  Will that &euro;766 million be enough to retain the viability of those services going into a six-week period of 25% capacity?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#H00700","speaker":"1564"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":475,"content":"<p>We do not know but we are monitoring it because we know how critical public transport is for our communities.

We are looking at protecting as many sectors as possible, ensuring we are protecting public health at the same time.  We are asking people not to leave their homes under level 5 unless it is for essential purposes or exercise within 5 km.  We all know the protocols around that.

People expect and understand minor bumps in the road with regard to projects, given the year we are having.  From what I can see and what the Department of Transport has published, the major projects still seem to be moving forward more or less at the pace that has been set out.  Hopefully, that will continue.<\/p> <p>  I will make a small point the Minister of State might consider.  During the previous lockdown earlier this year, the Dublin Port tunnel, which operates at &euro;10 during peak hours, southbound in the morning and northbound in the evening, reduced to &euro;3 and that was seen as a measure for essential workers.  There are many people living in north Dublin, Louth and Meath who work in hospitals or critical infrastructure in south Dublin.  Is that something the Minister of State might consider re-implementing for the next six weeks?  She does not need to answer that now but she might come back to me on it.<\/p> <p>  A great deal of funding is going towards active travel, which is fantastic.  Walking and cycling to school safely is a key priority for all of us.  I live in an estate that is right beside two schools that one does not have to cross a road to get to and I still see parents, even on a fine morning, drive their kids 50 yards up the road to school, which can be frustrating.  I am not sure what more we can do for people like that - probably nothing.<\/p><p>Correct me if I am wrong, but the Government announced that it would aim to spend the equivalent of &euro;1 million per day on cycle lanes.  I do not see that matched up here.  I might be thinking of two different pots and confusing a promise with reality.

I will return to the point I made to Deputy Matthews about the call on local authorities.  The funding will be there.  It is about identifying projects.  As I said, the July stimulus package may have caught some local authorities slightly on the hop, which is why we asked for projects that were ready to go and did not need planning or compulsory purchase orders.  It was for footpaths that needed upgrading, segregated cycleways and other projects that could be done easily.  We want to continue that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned schools.  We need to try to work with schools to target people who do not need to drive 1 km or a couple of hundred metres to drop off children outside the school.  That is not going to change without consultation between school management and local authorities.  We need to work and provide the infrastructure to have safe zones around schools that will enable parents to feel safe in dropping off their children.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#J00200","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":481,"content":"<p>On the issue of active travel, I believe there is a lot of low-hanging fruit by way of paths and junctions.

I am already briefed, in the sense that some of the questions I had intended to ask have already been asked and there is no point in repetition.<\/p> <p>  What level of driving tests is being conducted at the moment?  Based on the feedback that I am getting from applicants for driving tests in Tipperary, the system would appear to be at a standstill.  The waiting list is getting longer and longer and, as a result, many young people who require a test are inconvenienced because they cannot access the service and are therefore unable to drive for essential purposes.  What is the current period of delay from the time an application is made to an actual test?<\/p> <p>  I will also ask about Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Expressway service.  Bus services on routes from Cork to Dublin and Limerick to Dublin, which takes in a large part of Tipperary, are under a cloud at the moment.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has effectively said that it is going to dispense with them.  Towns along the route from Limerick, including Nenagh, Toomevara and Roscrea, and along the route from Cork, including Cashel, will be affected.  Cashel is a busy town and it is crucial to have connectivity.  For many, that bus service is the only connectivity.  It is an important service that is valued locally and used extensively in Cashel.  Is the decision to curtail the Expressway service final or is it under review?  Does the Minister of State understand the absolute necessity for Expressway services to be continued and can she intervene to see if they can be restored?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State said that there is an increased budget for rural transport services that respond to local needs.  Some &euro;2 million is available in funding for the launch of new services in 2020.  How is that additional fund accessed?  Is it by way of application and, if so, what are the criteria and procedures to seek those funds?  This is obviously important in rural areas.<\/p> <p>  What is the position regarding private bus operators?  Many of them are effectively non-viable.  They have had no income, despite the fact that they have overheads, for the past seven to eight months.  They are leaderless and rudderless at the moment and have an uncertain future.  The Minister of State mentioned in her statement that there is &euro;100 million in additional funding.  Who is in charge of that fund?  Who makes the decision on how that funding is allocated?  Is that still open or have decisions been made on it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#J00400","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  That &euro;100 million for private bus operators and Local Link is managed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and applications to access that funding happen through the agency.  It is identifying the gaps in service as a result of the cessation of the Expressway service.  That work is ongoing and falls under the remit of the NTA.<\/p><p>The Deputy also raised the issue of driving tests.  Eight driving tests were carried out per day before the onset of the pandemic and five tests per day are currently being carried out.  In March, during complete lockdown, zero tests were being carried out and, as we opened up, five tests per day were being carried out because of issues around having to sanitise the test centres, minimising the numbers of people attending and ensuring the sanitisation of the cars into which testers were sitting.  Essential services will be prioritised.  If people have a driving test already and know that they can proceed, I ask them to proceed with the test.  It is an essential service.  Anyone who is an essential worker, and <i><\/i>outlines who qualifies as an essential worker, for example healthcare workers, can contact <i>urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie<\/i>. <\/p><p>To answer the Deputy's question, there is a large backlog in testing and it is of concern.  People are not able to access tests.  We have been grappling with this and trying to rehire temporary testers who were laid off during the initial lockdown.  Another cohort whose employment was due to cease this month and next month will be kept on.  We are increasing the number of testers.  I suppose the fundamental issue is the amount of testers that we can have within the centre at one time and the amount of people who are looking for a test that can attend.  It is a matter of balancing the health protocol and the backlog.  At the same time, we are looking at procuring further testers to come on board over the next few months.  It is an issue of concern for people.  I say again that essential workers can contact <i>urgentdrivingtest@rsa.ie<\/i>for priority.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#J00500","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":484,"content":"<p>Does the Minister of State have a response to the questions I asked about Bus &Eacute;ireann Expressway and the effect on Cashel and Nenagh?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#J00600","speaker":"1609"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":485,"content":"<p>The NTA is assessing the gaps in service and will determine which services need to be put back in place.

I gave an extensive commentary at the most recent sitting of the committee on what was required to try to assist our airports and it is fantastic to see that the Government stepped in and provided that support.  I know it is appreciated and it will be an ongoing situation to try to help the aviation sector in the next number of years.  It is not going to happen overnight and a lot of other issues need to be discussed but first and foremost, implementing financial supports was welcome.  I know it is appreciated in Cork and I am conscious that I am only Deputy here from Cork county.<\/p><p>I sincerely encourage the Minister of State to continue her engagement with the airport and the DAA.<\/p><p> It was welcome to see a &euro;1 billion increase in investment from the Department of Transport in the budget for 2020.  I have had engagement with the local authorities, especially Cork County Council, which is the local authority for the entirety of my constituency.  There has been a degree of concern around the funding allocated and the inability of the council in some cases to get the opportunity to fulfil or to get through the entire amount of money allocated for different grants and so on.  The active travel grant was flagged with me.  There was concern around the lack of timing to plan for this.  The grant is an excellent measure and I really welcome it.  I am an avid walker and I know it will make a fantastic difference around the county.  Fair play to the Department of Transport for putting proper investment in place.  There was a degree of anxiety relating to local authorities that have ongoing projects.  They want to try to get proper timing and planning in place so that they can actually spend the money allocated.  Can the Minister of State look into ways the funding could be carried on from 2020 into 2021?<\/p><p> There is a bad situation in Cork County Council.  We know Cork County Council has one of the lowest funding rates per linear metre in the country.  It comes down to economies of scale and the fact that it is the largest local authority in terms of geographical size and it has the largest road network.  Unfortunately, I would be the first person to tell the committee that it is not good on the ground.  It is certainly an area in respect of which I call on the Minister of State to reach out to the director of roads.  I know the Minister of State has engaged with him already.  The council staff are doing excellent work.  They are doing their best, but when it comes to funding the council is in a bad situation.  I was a member of the transport committee in Cork County Council before I was elected to the D&aacute;il.  Certainly, it was in a bad place with funding.  Perhaps this could be one area the Minister of State might get an opportunity to look at in the months ahead and coming into 2021.<\/p><p> Another area where I have done significant work since I began my political career has been the relationship around Bus &Eacute;ireann's Expressway services and its public service obligation services.  I spoke in the D&aacute;il about this when the Minister of State was present.  This is really an area on which the Government could focus in the coming years.  We could have a significant improvement in the percentage of people in the community using public transport services to get to and from work.  I know the pandemic has changed people's lives and the way they live.  It might be a long time before we see a major increase in the number of people using public transport services but we should start putting a plan in place now, while there is an opportunity and while things are fairly quiet with public transport companies, to try to see how we can improve on it.<\/p><p> There is one particular area in County Cork that needs to be addressed.  I know the Cabinet signed off on the contract for the Dunkettle interchange.  One problem that always bothered me was the fact there are no public transport services servicing the large employers on the south side of Cork city with the major residential areas like Middleton, Carrigtwohill and Youghal on the far side.  Thousands of people are commuting up and down in their cars every day.  The only reason they are not utilising public transport services is, frankly, that there is no option.  A motorist who goes through the tunnel in Cork has access to Mahon Point, Ringaskiddy, Cork University Hospital and the university and colleges.  This is a great chance for the Government to look at the services throughout Cork city and county and consider how they could improve.  We need to look at how people in the metropolitan towns are getting in and out to the city and to and from work.  I was on Cork radio recently.  I suggested that Cork could address this under the Cork metropolitan transport area strategy.  I said there was perhaps potential for a Cork bus service to be the same as the service in Dublin, whereby there is a focus on Cork as a county rather than having Bus &Eacute;ireann trying to manage the entire country with public service obligation services.  There are several problems with this.  Even from a reliability perspective, a great deal of money is going to PSO services.  The return to the public could certainly be improved on.  I do not mean that as a criticism but I certainly believe there is an opportunity for the Minister of State to take some time to look at that.  I would welcome any engagement the Minister of State could have with me on that.  I will give the her an opportunity to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#J00800","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connor referred to the July stimulus.  This issue has come up.  We have talked to local authority chief executives.  There is concern about the November deadline and completing the July stimulus projects.  I have said to them in my meetings with them that they should work as fast as they can and get as many of these projects up and running and under way.  A legislative provision allows some capital to be carried forward into next year.  I urge them to really try to get the works done and to prioritise them.  I know some local authorities have left other projects, for which they have received funding, on the backburner to get this done.  I know Cork County Council and Cork City Council have ambitious plans and put in very good submissions on active travel, and I commend them on that.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue throughout the country.  It is not only about funding. Sometimes it is about the resources too, including the technical and engineering experience needed to roll out these projects.  That is something we are looking at with the National Transport Authority.  We are looking at how to do this strategically to ensure this funding is used.  Local authorities have to lead but we may need technical expertise for active travel measures.  That is something I am looking at currently.  We need to do it in an effective way.  It is not simply a matter of appointing someone.  It should be the role of a person to roll out these active travel measures.  I hear the message from Deputy O'Connor loud and clear.  The funding is positive.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Connor mentioned the issue of bus services and public transport.  We have this issue in my city of Galway as well.  The issue is with public transport and having an efficient service.  People will use it if it is available.  The NTA will be looking at that.  The local authority will be in regular contact with the NTA around lack of service provision and where it is needed in the county.  We can address this through engagement and highlighting the areas where we have a population mass and people at work and where there is demand.  I urge the local authorities to engage with the NTA in this regard as well.<\/p> <p>  I recognise the concerns raised by Deputy O'Connor around the airport.  This is of critical importance to the Government.  We need to ensure we support Cork.

I will offer some simple suggestions to her in terms of giving people a greater impression on reliability of public transport services.  This is a big problem in rural towns and villages, especially in my constituency.  Live feedback signs would help.  I would really like to see an opportunity for Bus &Eacute;ireann to put in place live feedback signs, like they have in Dublin for Dublin Bus services, in some of the rural towns.  It would give people the impression that they know when the bus will arrive.  That comes up repeatedly.  I get many calls to my office from people who are unsure whether they have missed the bus or whether it is coming or on the way.  There is no reason places like Killeagh and Castlemartyr, which are being serviced by Expressway and Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO services on a main arterial route connecting to Cork city, should not have this infrastructure.<\/p> <p>  Another area where we could make fundamental changes to transport structure in Cork is the fare structure.  The green commuter zone area is not spread out wide enough throughout the county.  This impacts not only my constituency but well into other areas around the city.  Towns are being locked out of accessing cheap fares.  The consequence is that people do not want to use the services because there is no financial incentive for them to do so.  That is very important.  We talk about just transition and we need to allow people that opportunity.<\/p> <p>  I wish to stress one point again.  Roads funding for small rural and local roads in the Cork County Council area is a major problem.  I appeal to the Minister of State to engage with the council on the matter.  I do not like having to tell people their roads cannot be repaired or fixed while they are paying road tax and other taxes and charges.  For many people it is difficult to understand why they can cross the border into Waterford and drive on perfect roads while in County Cork, because of a lack of funding in Cork County Council, the roads are not as good as they could be.  Our national roads in County Cork could be far better too.

I am speaking frankly.  What I will say is there is legislative provision in place that would allow some projects to be carried forward.  Once the projects are well under way and under construction, that is fantastic.

A highly important part of the programme for Government is coming up shortly.  I am sure part of the 2020 budget was included in it.  I refer to the national development plan.  Throughout the course of Deputy Hildegarde Naughton's ministerial career in this portfolio, I am sure it will probably be the largest policy document that will be impacted by the current Government.  In relation to my own constituency, as the Chairman has said, in terms of the N20, that is a significant concern to people in Cork East.  A lot of my family are from Mallow and that area at the north-western side of my constituency.  It is crucial to that town that this motorway is built and there is proper access given to local residents onto and off that motorway when the time comes for construction.<\/p> <p>  There is one other project as well, on which I had extensive discussions with the Taoiseach,the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, already.  I flag it with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, as she has individual responsibility for the road network.  I refer to the issues on the N25 around Castlemartyr.  Castlemartyr is at the heart of the east Cork area.  It is famous for the hotel and for other amenities and tourist destinations in close proximity to the area.  I would be hopeful that could be included in the national development plan, NDP, which is coming up in the next number of weeks.  There are 24,000 vehicles a day going up and down the main street of Castlemartyr and there is a desperate need to get funding to solve that for reasons of air pollution and connectivity and to reduce the 20-minute wait people are experiencing coming in and out of the village.  It is bad for people in Youghal because it impacts on them in getting home from the city in the evening which is not fair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#N00700","speaker":"1516"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>When is the review of the NDP formally getting under way?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#N00800","nonspeaker":"Chairman"},{"type":"speech","time":1603234800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>There is no date but it is happening within the next few months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TTS2020102100002#N00900","speaker":"1578"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1603234800,"counter":556,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for attending today's meeting and engaging with the committee.
