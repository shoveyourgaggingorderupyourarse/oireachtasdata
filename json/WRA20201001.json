Almost all tourism businesses were initially required to close in order to comply with the necessary public health measures introduced. Many have since reopened but, unfortunately, the majority of businesses are operating with significantly reduced levels of turnover compared to 2019 as a result of ongoing public health measures and the almost complete absence of overseas tourists coming into the country. This has meant that many jobs in the sector have been lost or are vulnerable.<\/p>  <p>  Along with my colleagues in Government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this current crisis. The July Stimulus Package introduced significant measures to help support businesses to recover following the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality\u00a0include the &ldquo;Stay and Spend&rdquo; initiative, the &euro;26m adaptation grant, the &euro;10m grant for coach tourism and the revised Restart grant which now includes B&amp;B&rsquo;s.\u00a0 Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal supports such as the new Employment Wage Support Scheme, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its response to Covid-19, and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year.\u00a0 I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home.<\/p>  <p>  All of these measures have helped the sector.

Those taskforces include:<\/p>  <p>  - The Tourism Industry Taskforce;<\/p>  <p>  - The Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce;<\/p>  <p>  - The Night-time Economy Taskforce, and;<\/p>  <p>  - An Expert Group on Return to Sport.<\/p>  <p>  I will consider the views and recommendations of these taskforces in the context of Budget 2021 and in mapping out how to best help those sectors remain viable going forward. With the upcoming Budget and the development of the National Economic Plan, the Government will continue to review and refine existing supports, and consider any further necessary measures required as a consequence of COVID-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100073#WRB03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Caiteachas Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta","counter":88,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100073#WRB03300"},{"type":"question","counter":89,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[26627\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100073#WRB03400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"c&eacute;ard iad na tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; beartais at&aacute; aici i leith na Gaeilge don bhliain seo romhainn; c&aacute; mh&eacute;ad airgead at&aacute; ar f&aacute;il aici i mbliana don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht; agus an nd&eacute;anfaidh s&iacute; r&aacute;iteas ina thaobh.","asker":"1575","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":90,"content":"<p>T&aacute; tosa&iacute;ochta an Rialtais maidir leis an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht leagtha amach sa Chl&aacute;r Rialtais a foils&iacute;odh l&eacute; d&eacute;ana&iacute;.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tugann an Rialtas nua aitheantas do th&aacute;bhacht na Gaeilge mar ch&eacute;ad teanga an st&aacute;it,\u00a0mar theanga bheo agus mar chuid d&aacute;r n-oidhreacht.\u00a0 T&aacute;imid diongbh&aacute;ilte, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in go mbeadh amharc n&iacute;os fearr ar an teanga\u00a0ach freisin go l&aacute;idreofa&iacute;\u00a0a h&uacute;s&aacute;id\u00a0laeth&uacute;il mar theanga phobail.\u00a0\u00a0T&aacute; s&eacute; mar aidhm ag an Rialtas agus agam f&eacute;in go mbeidh daoine arb &iacute; an Ghaeilge a gc&eacute;ad teanga cumhachtaithe mar shaor&aacute;naithe.\u00a0 Tabharfaidh an Rialtas seo agus mise mar Aire, cumhdach do cheantair\u00a0Gaeltachta agus d&eacute;anfar iad\u00a0a chaomhn&uacute; sa treo is go bhfanfaidh siad mar chro&iacute;-l&aacute;r den teanga bheo.<\/p>  <p>  Leanfar le cur i bhfeidhm na Strait&eacute;ise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge agus leis na spriocanna ar leas na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta at&aacute; leagtha amach sa Plean Gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta 2018-2022 a foils&iacute;odh i Meitheamh 2018.\u00a0\u00a0Foilseofar\u00a0an ch&eacute;ad tuarasc&aacute;il maidir le dul chun cinn an phlean sin go luath a chuimseoidh an tr&eacute;imhse 12 mh&iacute; &oacute; I&uacute;il 2018 go Meitheamh 2019.<\/p>  <p>  I measc na ruda&iacute; faoi leith at&aacute; luaite sa Phlean at&aacute; ag imirt tionchair dhearfa&iacute; cheana f&eacute;in ar an nGaeltacht, t&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga, cl&aacute;ir thaca&iacute;ochta &eacute;ags&uacute;la mo Roinne agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta faoi seach chomh maith leis an bPolasa&iacute; don Oideachas Gaeltachta at&aacute; &aacute; chur i bhfeidhm ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis an bpr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga, t&aacute; 18 plean teanga ceadaithe go dt&iacute; seo\u00a0I gceantair Ghaeltachta.<\/p>  <p>  Maidir leis an mbliain seo romhainn, mar is eol don Teachta, \u00a0is faoin bpr&oacute;is&eacute;as meast&uacute;ch&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anfar all&uacute;ntas na Roinne a dheimhni&uacute; don bhliain 2021.

While these supports are wide ranging, they will by their nature be of most assistance to the most heavily impacted firms and sectors.<\/p>  <p>  The July Stimulus Package was, as promised, a package of measures of sufficient scale that demonstrates the commitment this Government has to save enterprises, limit the damage to our economy wreaked by this pandemic and get our people back to work. Indeed, it is bigger in scale than most budgets and it is being deployed at speed and includes:<\/p>  <p>  - A new Employment Wage Support Scheme that will succeed the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme and run until April 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - Restart Grants of up to &euro;25,000 available to a broad category of businesses such as hairdressers, sports clubs, cafes, restaurants, B&amp;Bs, and independent hotels to help cover the costs incurred during closure and reopening costs;<\/p>  <p>  - The &lsquo;Stay and Spend&rsquo; initiative will see consumers benefit by up to &euro;125 each for expenditure on hospitality activities during the traditional &lsquo;off peak&rsquo; for this sector;<\/p>  <p>  - A &euro;10 million Restart Fund for the Tourism Sector;<\/p>  <p>  - The new &euro;2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme to provide Irish businesses with access to low cost loans as they respond to the impacts of COVID-19.

This included a 40% Restart Grant Plus Top Up for pubs, bars and nightclubs that remain closed to help them to reopen, a waiver of court fees and associated excise and stamp duties relating to the renewal of pub and other liquor licences in 2020 and a waiver of excise duty on on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  While we have, and will continue to, help our business, we are also assisting those who may have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19 or whose jobs continue to be in a precarious position, getting staff back to work and creating new opportunities for those unable to return to their old jobs. Indeed, a &euro;200 million investment in education and training was announced in the July Stimulus. To support people without jobs, especially young people the July Stimulus included:<\/p>  <p>  - A clear timeline for the continuation of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will help to provide assurances to those who suffered job losses;<\/p>  <p>  - A new Apprenticeship Incentivisation Scheme to assist employers to continue to recruit apprentices during the immediate Covid-19 period;<\/p>  <p>  - Funding for some 60,000 places in further and higher education, skills training, and work placement and experience schemes; and<\/p>  <p>  - The JobsPlus Scheme that will provide subsidies to encourage employers to hire someone under the age of 30 who is on the Live Register or the Pandemic Unemployment Payment.<\/p>  <p>  Having come through the initial economic shock with unprecedented levels of State intervention stabilising the economy, the focus is now on sustaining the recovery in the face of uncertainty and disruption while seeking to minimise permanent loss of economic activity and employment.

Currently under the ETD, aviation fuel, except for that which is used in private-pleasure flying, is exempt from excise duty although Member States can choose to tax aviation fuel for domestic flights and, by means of bilateral agreements, also fuel used in intra-EU flight. The Commission has suggested that this exemption for aviation fuel should be closely examined and the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union has published an Inception Impact Assessment on revising the ETD.

requires a comparison of the firm&rsquo;s pre-pandemic operations with their current operations and has been specifically designed so as to target the subsidy at otherwise viable employers whose businesses continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  There is additional flexibility in the application of the turnover test to allow employers to take account of potentially sudden changes in turnover on a month-to-month &ldquo;opt-in\/opt-out&rdquo; basis.\u00a0 Under the legislation, an employer is required to carry out a review of their turnover each month and confirm that they are still eligible for the scheme.\u00a0 At the same time, there is no cut-off deadline for access to the scheme, so if there is a reduction in turnover later in 2020 because of an unexpected reduction in business activity or a sudden change in business circumstances the employer may be entitled to make a claim for that future period. \u00a0In this regard, it should be noted that an employer needs to have registered before the first pay date they wish to claim for.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, it is possible that an employer would not need to avail of the scheme for September or October 2020 but make a valid application for November 2020 thereby taking account of business turnover fluctuations over the period. <\/p>  <p>  There are no plans at present to re-visit the core eligibility criteria for the EWSS.\u00a0 However, I can confirm to the Deputy that the operation of the EWSS and its effectiveness will be kept under close review over the coming months. \u00a0In fact, the relevant legislation obliges me to monitor and superintend the administration of the scheme and empowers me to make certain adjustments across the whole scheme where I determine that these are necessary.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that as of 30 September some 37,165 employers have successfully registered for the scheme, which is considered a strong level of participation so far and, notably, over 83% of the employers availing of the TWSS when it finished at the end of August.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For businesses who need further support there are a number of options open to them &ndash; including State backed loans which may be repaid using EWSS funds as well as grants.\u00a0 Particular attention is drawn to the comprehensive package of business and employer supports that have been made available as part of the July Stimulus Plan - including the Credit Guarantee Scheme, the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, Sustaining Enterprise Fund, and the Covid-19 Business Loans Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100076#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs","counter":239,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100076#WRE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":240,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[27701\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100076#WRE01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the young trained farmer stamp duty relief age limit will be increased to 40 years of age;

Rather than the normal interest rate of c. 10% per annum on such liabilities, interest on &lsquo;warehoused&rsquo; debts is applied at 0% to the end of the &lsquo;Period 2&rsquo; 12-month period and 3% thereafter until the liabilities are paid (known as Period 3).<\/p>  <p>  Access to the &lsquo;warehousing&rsquo; arrangements are dependent on all outstanding tax returns being filed and current taxes being paid on a timely basis once trading is resumed.

wages and identify the amount of the subsidy paid to the employee on the employees&rsquo; payslip. <\/p>  <p>  Employers were required to download information provided by Revenue based on their January and February payroll and use it to calculate the wage subsidy for an employee.\u00a0 There was no obligation on an employer to claim the maximum amount of subsidy for an individual employee.\u00a0 It is therefore possible that the amount of subsidy that was claimed and recorded was less than the worker expected, based on the publicised maximum limits of the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, the employer was expected to make best efforts to maintain the employee&rsquo;s net income, as reflected in the average net weekly payment for January and February 2020, for the duration of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  However, the individual worker&rsquo;s entitlements and rights in an employment context, what wages an employer may have been legally obliged to pay employees in respect of hours worked and the employer&rsquo;s capacity to pay wages to employees in light of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic had on the employer&rsquo;s business are all matters that are outside the remit of the TWSS.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also placed the administration of the TWSS under the care and management of Revenue.\u00a0 In carrying out this important role, Revenue is conducting a programme of compliance checks on all employers who availed of the scheme to confirm that they met the eligibility criteria, and crucially that employees received the correct amount of subsidy due to them.<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that it is in the process of carrying out compliance checks on the 66,000 employers who participated in the TWSS scheme to ensure that they were properly eligible to receive these monies and that the supports were properly paid out to qualifying employees.\u00a0 I understand that, to date, checks have been initiated in respect of some 35% of TWSS employers representing some 67% of employments supported by the scheme.\u00a0 These checks will continue for\u00a0the next number of\u00a0months.\u00a0 Revenue advise that their enquiries to date have indicated high levels of compliance by employers with the requirements of the scheme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I am further advised that Revenue intends to conduct a reconciliation exercise for employers who participated in the scheme to compare the refunds paid to an employer against the amount of subsidy payable to each employee per pay date under the conditions of the scheme. The aim of this exercise is to determine the amount of TWSS, if any that an employer may owe back to Revenue. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that an employer may be required to repay amounts of TWSS where the employer has not paid the subsidy amount to the specified employee or where the employer was not entitled to receive the subsidy in the first place as it did not meet the qualifying criteria.

In light of this, work is ongoing in assessing the impact of Covid-19 costs in 2021.\u00a0Consequently, there is a range of potential expenditure requirements that need to be worked through in detail.\u00a0\u00a0At this stage, on a no policy change basis, and assuming an improved position in relation to employment next year based on the latest macroeconomic projections, it is estimated that there\u00a0could be a cost of approximately &euro;9 billion in relation to Covid-19 expenditure reflecting:<\/p>  <p>  - the carryover costs of the\u00a0July stimulus programme;<\/p>  <p>  - significant expenditure on automatic stabilisers including job-seekers payments and related supports;<\/p>  <p>  - ongoing costs in health to deal with Covid-19;<\/p>  <p>  - the carryover costs relating to both the Roadmap for Reopening Schools, and to the package of supports\u00a0 to enable further and higher education students to return to college; and<\/p>  <p>  - the ongoing requirement to fund public transport while employees continue to be encouraged\u00a0to work from home.<\/p>  <p>  Further details will be set out in detail in the 2021 Expenditure Report.

The impact of the drop in value of sterling since the UK referendum on EU membership in 2016 has been that from a tourism perspective,\u00a0Ireland has\u00a0become a more expensive destination for UK visitors.\u00a0 The number of British visitors to Ireland in 2019 was 3.5% less<b><\/b>than in 2016 and the associated revenue generated by British visitors was 7.9% less in 2019 than in 2016.<\/p><p>A No-Deal Brexit, combined with impacts of Covid-19, will have very significant negative impacts for Irish tourism. It will mean fewer tourists, lower revenues, less employment and a lost in Exchequer earnings from the sector. These losses will impact Ireland as a whole but will be felt hardest in regional areas where there are few alternatives to replace the economic benefits generated by tourism.<\/p><p>In 2019, the Government\u00a0allocated almost &euro;8 million in additional funding to the tourism agencies specifically to respond to the impact of Brexit.

The Scheme supports the aims and objectives of the Social, Scientific and Environmental Education (SSEE) curriculum and provides an additional educational tool and resource for teachers. The scheme is part-funded by the school and the Heritage Council.<\/p>  <p>  Visits generally relate to heritage in the locality of the school, and, in previous years, through the Scheme, the children could develop a knowledge and appreciation for the uniqueness of their locality through trips to local parks, woods, lakes, rivers, sea-shores, old graveyards, castles or churches or other places of interest through structured field trips with a Heritage specialist.<\/p>  <p>  While visits to schools have, of course, been on hold since mid-March 2020 due to COVID 19, the spirit of the scheme has been kept alive, and heritage specialists on the Panel were invited to make videos for promotion online. 30 online videos were developed, with the heritage specialists covering a vast range of topics from potato planting, folklore on herbs and\u00a0 beetle identification to modelling archaeological sites out of papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; and singing traditional songs. These have proven very popular with family groups too and are, of course, available to families who are home-schooling. <\/p>  <p>  Public health remains the main priority of the Heritage Council, who will continue to play its part in keeping everyone safe. There are many factors to consider before the programme can open up to physical visits again, including a risk assessment on managing future processes for visits, as well as compliance with individual school COVID 19 policy statements and risk assessments. <\/p>  <p>  The Council is, however, working on a virtual programme which is being piloted in counties Donegal and Kilkenny, with the Education Centres and the Heritage Officers.\u00a0 The response from schools so far has been very positive with approximately 90 requests for virtual visits registered to date. More detailed information on the videos, the virtual programme and the Heritage\u00a0Council&rsquo;s other activities is available on its website www.heritagecouncil.ie\u00a0or\u00a0by contacting the Council directly.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  While funding for parents who are home-schooling is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills, the Heritage in Schools online material is available to all and can be found on the Heritage Council&rsquo;s website.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100078#WRG05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Waterways Issues","counter":396,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH00300"},{"type":"question","counter":397,"qnumday":151,"qnumall":"[27728\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH00400","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the works carried out by local authorities in respect of maintenance work on the River Shannon; and the cost of each project in 2017, 2018 and 2019, in tabular form.","asker":"1495","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":398,"content":"<p>This is an operational\u00a0matter for individual local authorities in the Shannon basin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pyrite Remediation Programme","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH00600"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":152,"qnumall":"[27771\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH00700","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the status of a remediation scheme for those who have been affected by pyrite in their homes, including those who have not fallen under the remit of previous schemes but who are still affected by the issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1473","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>The Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 provides the statutory framework for the establishment of the Pyrite Resolution Board and for the making of a pyrite remediation scheme to be implemented by the Board with support from the Housing Agency. <\/p>  <p>  The provisions of the Act apply only to dwellings affected by significant damage attributable to pyritic heave consequent on the presence of reactive pyrite in the subfloor hardcore material and not to damage arising in any other circumstance, e.g. such as pyrite in concrete blocks.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; for affected homeowners who have no other practical option to obtain redress and is limited in its application and scope. The full conditions for eligibility under the scheme are set out in the scheme which is available on the Board&rsquo;s website, www.pyriteboard.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave, established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2017 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.\u00a0 In this regard, it is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.\u00a0 Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.\u00a0 This ensures that, having regard to the available resources, the focus of the scheme is on dwellings which are most severely damaged by pyritic heave.\u00a0There are no proposals to provide for further financial assistance outside of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As matters currently stand, the owners of dwellings located within the counties of Kildare, Meath or Offaly or the administrative areas of Fingal County Council, Dublin City Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown or South Dublin are eligible to apply for remediation works under the scheme and I have recently extended the pyrite remediation scheme to include the administrative area of Limerick City and County Council, which will see homeowners of dwellings with significant damage attributable to pyritic heave in County Limerick eligible to apply for remediation works under the Pyrite Remediation Scheme.<\/p>  <p>  &euro;20m was provided under Budget 2020 to cover the implementation of the pyrite remediation scheme and is a clear signal of the continuing importance attached by Government to addressing the issue of significant pyritic damage in private dwellings.

Accordingly, 2014 GPG allocations are not directly comparable to previous years. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Local retention of LPT began in 2015, when LPT allocations replaced GPGs.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, the Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than it received from its GPG allocation in 2014. Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 took account of the historical GPG funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area. For 2017 onwards, the LPT baseline of each local authority was increased to include an additional amount equivalent to the Pension Related Deduction income retained by local authorities in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the then Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform initiated an Inter-Departmental review of LPT. The purpose of the review was to inform the Minister in relation to any actions he may recommend to Government concerning the overall yield from LPT and its contribution to total tax revenue. The review was informed by the desirability of achieving relative stability, both over the short and longer terms, in LPT payments of liable persons. While the LPT Review was completed last year, having considered the findings of the Review, the Minister for Finance decided to defer the revaluation date for LPT purposes to 1 November 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the revaluation has\u00a0now been deferred until 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that in future all LPT collected will be retained in the county in which is collected. This is to be done on the basis that that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer. My Department will advance work on the implementation of this committment in the coming months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":437,"content":"<p>Question No. 166 answered with Question No. 148.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Prevention Measures","counter":438,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH04700"},{"type":"question","counter":439,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[28018\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100079#WRH04800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will address a matter (details supplied) regarding dredging; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":440,"content":"<p>My role and responsibilities as Minister\u00a0do not extend to the maintenance, clearance, or dredging\u00a0of rivers.

Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes,\u00a0any staff taken on to\u00a0support those functions are employees of individual schools.\u00a0 Specific responsibility for\u00a0terms of employment rests with the school.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of\u00a0a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries\u00a0and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.\u00a0 This arbitration agreement covered the period up to 31 December 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In May last year F&oacute;rsa trade union tabled a follow-on claim from the 2015 pay agreement.\u00a0 Officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and School Management Bodies\u00a0are in discussions with F&oacute;rsa under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The matter is a complex one that raises significant policy, legal and Exchequer cost issues.

We know from research that teachers are very good at making judgements about their students in the local context of the school.\u00a0 Schools approached this task in a very professional manner, in line with detailed guidelines about the process, but inevitably some schools were overly harsh in their estimations while others were overly generous. This is to be expected given that there is no national standard on which to base an estimated mark.\u00a0 But in order to be fair to the class of 2020, the teacher judgements made at the level of the school had to be adjusted so that a common national standard was applied.\u00a0 \u00a0It was inherent to the system of calculated grades that school estimates would be subject to adjustment through this standardisations process.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These adjustments resulted in the school estimates staying the same or being revised upwards or downwards. The standardisation process operated on the premise that the school estimates should only be adjusted through the standardisation process where there was credible statistical evidence to justify changing them.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A standardising\u00a0process\u00a0happens every year and\u00a0would\u00a0have happened\u00a0in 2020\u00a0had\u00a0the Leaving Certificate examinations been run as normal.\u00a0 In the system of calculated grades, the standardisation process applied uniformly across all subject and levels and school types. \u00a0The degree to which mark changes occurred related to the degree of over or underestimation in the school estimates for each subject and each level.\u00a0 This means that some students experienced mark changes from the school estimates but no changes to the grades based on the school estimates; while others will have experienced marks changes from the teacher estimates leading to grade changes in one or more of their subjects.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Following standardisation, the estimated percentage mark was converted to a calculated mark and subsequently, a calculated grade which was provided to students on 7 September. It is only at this point that students were awarded a grade.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, it is not accurate to state that student(s) were downgraded, or upgraded, through the standardisation process.\u00a0 Rather the grade that was awarded following the standardisation process is the grade for the 2020 Leaving Certificate (Calculated Grades).\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0overall data\u00a0on\u00a0school estimated marks showed\u00a0that there was a very significant rise\u00a0in estimated grades against what would normally be achieved nationally.\u00a0This\u00a0level\u00a0of grade increase based on the school estimates would have been\u00a0unrealistic.\u00a0For example, based on the school data there would have been 13.8% H1 grades this year when in a normal year there is 5.8%.\u00a0Even with the\u00a0standardisation\u00a0process the rate of H1s this year is over 9%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2020 every effort has been made to make the system as fair as possible for as many students a possible. The statistical model used was blind to demographic characteristics either at the level of the student or the school.\u00a0\u00a0 The standardisation process means that the same standard has been applied uniformly across all schools.\u00a0 This means anyone using the certificate to make a judgement between two people who hold this certificate, either now or in the future, can place equal value on the same grade in the same subject, without regard to where they went to school, as they would in a normal year.<\/p>  <p>  Individual Junior Cycle results were not used to determine any individual&rsquo;s Calculated Grades. Rather, the Calculated Grades process took account of the overall Junior Cycle performance of the Leaving Certificate class of 2020 in each school and used this data to help in predicting the likely range of Leaving Certificate performance of that group using related information about the relationship between performance at Junior Cycle and Leaving Certificate based on national data over time. <\/p>  <p>  The fact that the vast majority of 2020 Leaving Certificate students would have sat the Junior Cycle examinations provides a good means of predicting the pattern of performance of these students at an aggregate level. The process was not applied at an individual student level. \u00a0The Junior Cycle data for2020 Leaving Certificate students who had sat their examinations in another school were carried in to the school at which they were registered to sit the Leaving Certificate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100080#WRJ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":481,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100080#WRJ03500"},{"type":"question","counter":482,"qnumday":181,"qnumall":"[27948\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100080#WRJ03600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the lack of teacher-student interaction in circumstances in which remote learning is required due to the Covid-19 pandemic in certain instances; the actions and steps she will take to ensure that there is a national standard to deliver such remote learning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1488","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":483,"content":"<p>My Department has published guidance to support schools in making adapted education provision for pupils\/students with an underlying medical condition who cannot return to school because they are medically certified as being at very high risk to COVID-19.<\/p><p>The guidance for primary schools on supporting such pupils is available via the following link: <\/p><p>The guidance for post-primary schools on supporting such students is available via the following link:  \u00a0<\/p><p>Overall responsibility for ensuring that pupils\/students who are at very high risk to COVID-19 receive appropriate support to engage adequately with learning remains with the school in which they are enrolled.<\/p><p>The guidance provides that supports will be provided for these pupils\/students through designated teachers from within the staffing resources of the school.

They effectively allow a taxpayer to write off the cost of an asset over a period of time and to reduce their reckonable income as a result.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100081#WRK02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Respite Care Grant","counter":531,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100081#WRK02600"},{"type":"question","counter":532,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[27809\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100081#WRK02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full-year cost of restoring the respite grant to its highest historical level.","asker":"1478","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":533,"content":"<p>The Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant (formerly called the Respite Care Grant) is an annual payment for carers who look after people in need of full-time care and attention.<\/p><p>The grant\u00a0is paid\u00a0in a single annual lump sum, usually on the first Thursday in June.\u00a0 The grant is not means-tested and is not taxable.\u00a0 It is paid in respect of each care recipient.\u00a0<\/p><p>It is paid:\u00a0<\/p><p>- automatically to people in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and Domiciliary Care Allowance;

In order to address an issue of this scale, the Department is currently developing an automated process, which will examine each case and look at their overall entitlement to payment and match this against their payment history.

I can assure the Deputy that this is a priority for the Department and it is hoped to make payments before end of\u00a0the year .\u00a0It is intended that awarded and closed cases will be identified for arrears payments\u00a0at the same time. <\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Inspections","counter":593,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL02600"},{"type":"question","counter":594,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[28013\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL02700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of complaints made in respect of social welfare inspectors by year from when records commenced by area office in tabular form.","asker":"1467","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":595,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy cannot be provided within the timeframe available. <\/p><p>The Department is now seeking to compile the data sought by the Deputy and will provide the relevant information directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fuel Allowance","counter":596,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL02900"},{"type":"question","counter":597,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[28060\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL03000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if and when the free fuel allowance will be awarded in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":598,"content":"<p>Fuel allowance is a means-tested payment to assist householders on long-term social welfare payments towards the cost of their heating needs.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The main eligibility conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, must satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or with other qualifying persons.\u00a0 <\/p><p>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned is not currently in receipt of a qualifying payment and does not therefore have an eligibility to a fuel allowance payment.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":600,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[28061\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100082#WRL03300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if and when the free fuel allowance will be awarded in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":601,"content":"<p>No application for Fuel allowance has been received form the person concerned.\u00a0 I have arranged for a fuel application form to issue to the person concerned.\u00a0 On receipt of the completed application, eligibility for fuel allowance will be examined and the person will be notified in writing of the decision.<\/p>  <p>  Fuel allowance is a means-tested payment to assist householders on long-term social welfare payments towards the cost of their heating needs.\u00a0 It is not intended to meet those costs in full.

The plan is framed to account for periods which there is a low incidence of the disease, with isolated clusters and low community transmission, through to situations where there is a high or rapidly increasing incidence, widespread community transmission and the pandemic is escalating rapidly in Ireland and globally.

People living outside of Donegal should not travel to Donegal, with the exception of those who must travel for work, education and other essential purposes. The purpose of these measures is to prevent further transmission of Covid-19 outside of Donegal.<\/p><p>While weddings with up to 25 people are permitted in Level 3 and can currently take place in Donegal, there is no exemption from the current travel restrictions for attending a wedding. This means that it will not be possible for residents outside of Donegal to attend weddings in Donegal, nor will it be possible for those in Donegal to attend weddings in other areas of the country.

The Government&rsquo;s commitment to continued enhancement of mental health services is shown in ongoing increases in the mental health budget. Since 2012, &euro;315 million has been added, bringing the mental health budget today to &euro;1.026 billion, an increase of 44%.<\/p>  <p>  Much has been achieved in mental health in recent years, but it is recognised that much remains to be done. Ireland has fundamentally robust legislation, policies and services that have been built up over time and which, overall, compare favourably internationally. More importantly, there are identified and widely agreed pathways to undertake further improvements in all these areas,\u00a0including improved residential and community-based care for children and adults and psychiatry of later life.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision\u00a0promotes equitable access to quality, safe mental health care for all citizens. Service users and their families, carers and supporters will have timely access to evidence-informed mental health services. Tailored measures will be put in place to ensure that individuals with complex mental health difficulties can avail of services across the State without discrimination. This builds on the intent of\u00a0A Vision for Change\u00a0and Sl&aacute;intecare and is expected to be implemented as part of a ten-year plan.<\/p>  <p>  Sharing the Vision\u00a0recognises and plans for the increasing need for mental health services and demand for more holistic person-centred responses. The ten-year plan addresses population needs through a focus on the requirements of individuals. It promises early intervention, with a focus on prevention and positive mental health promotion. This focus advocates a mental health system that works in partnership with service users and their families to deliver a range of integrated services and supports.<\/p>  <p>  Establishment of the National Monitoring and Implementation Committee (NIMC), to oversee\u00a0Sharing the Vision, is well advanced. The NIMC will drive reconfiguration, monitor progress against outcomes and deliver on commitments in the new policy.<\/p>  <p>  This year has been exceptional.

Acute inpatient and community residential facilities have remained open and patients have been provided with services throughout the pandemic, although with reduced numbers in some settings.<\/p>  <p>  Covid-19 has rapidly accelerated online delivery of mental health services. The Department of Health, with the HSE, has launched a number of initiatives to promote mental health and wellbeing, including the national Crisis Text-Line in June. An additional &euro;2.2m has been provided for a mental health promotion and well-being campaign, through enhanced online supports, and to support the HSE psychosocial strategy. This will enable implementation of integrated tele-health solutions and improve existing online interventions. Examples are the\u00a0free counselling sessions offered by HSE partners MyMind and online peer support groups for frontline workers from Turn2me.<\/p>  <p>  A key priority for Minister Butler and the Department is to update the 2001 Mental Health Act. The Act sets out the care and treatment of people (including children) with mental illness, including involuntary detention procedures and patient safeguards. The updating process is in line with expert advice, international best practice and human rights. The Department is finalising draft heads of a bill to amend the Act and hopes to finalise a draft bill by the end of 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Another priority is the new forensic mental health facility at Portrane. This significant and modern facility is expected to open early next year. The new 170-bed hospital complex will replace the Central Mental Hospital Dundrum (103 beds) as a modernised National Forensic Mental Health Service. It will include a 120-bed central mental hospital, a 10-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.<\/p>  <p>  Funding will be sought in this year&rsquo;s Estimates campaign to implement the short-term objectives of\u00a0Sharing the Vision.\u00a0This will, of course, be influenced by the availability of resources. However, the current budget of over &euro;1 billion enables the HSE to maintain and develop its wide range of mental health and suicide prevention services. These span all specialties and ages, from mental health promotion and early intervention to acute inpatient care and clinical programmes such as self-harm and eating disorders. Improving access and reducing waiting lists, where possible, are key Government objectives, despite acknowledged recruitment difficulties and the greatly changed Covid-19 operational environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100085#WRO05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cannabis for Medicinal Use","counter":801,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100085#WRO05200"},{"type":"question","counter":802,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[27845\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020100100085#WRO05300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the arrangements that were made while Covid-19 restrictions on travel were in place to accommodate persons using medicinal cannabis preparations under licence; the length of time such arrangements will continue; and his views on making such arrangements permanent.","asker":"1613","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":803,"content":"<p>On the 6th April, the Minister for Health announced an initiative to assist patients access to their medical cannabis products during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

The Government&rsquo;s determination to meet this challenge is demonstrated by its decision to invest an additional &euro;600m in health services this winter - &euro;200m in 2020 and &euro;400m in 2021 - to support the roll-out of the winter-specific measures. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE published its Winter Plan on 24 September. The HSE Winter Plan aims to reduce the number of patients waiting on trolleys for hospital admission by 30% and to improve Patient Experience Times, particularly in terms of keeping everyone safe while we respond to Covid-19. It aims to enable patients to be seen in the community wherever possible by providing a better service in community health care settings; to receive timely care in hospital when this is necessary; and to return home or to appropriate care settings when fit to leave hospital by providing more homecare and stepdown options. It aims to deliver 4.76 million more home support hours to facilitate this.<\/p>  <p>  There are additional supports in the HSE Winter Plan for people at greater risk including the elderly, homeless, and those with chronic illnesses to allow them to stay at home. It also provides additional Community Healthcare Networks, 36 more Community Specialist Teams and 11 additional acute hospital &lsquo;Front of House&rsquo; Frailty Intervention Teams. This will create the foundation and organisational structure through which integrated care will be provided locally within the community at the appropriate level of complexity. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Plan aims to deliver 79,000 more diagnostics in the community, again allowing patients to be seen closer to home and avoid going to hospital. The Plan puts in place supports for GPs, particularly those in rural practices, to support service continuity. A key action will be a comprehensive flu vaccination programme.

Day care and respite services have been suspended, and usual routines have been disrupted, creating additional pressures for people with dementia and their family carers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE have ensured that there has been a continued focus on meeting the needs of people living with dementia throughout the period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Through the Dementia Understand Together Campaign, led by the HSE and working with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland (ASI), a range of initiatives and resources have been developed, to ensure that people living with dementia stay safe, well and connected, during this time of crisis. The HSE is also signposting people with dementia to voluntary organisations for additional community supports.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE has adapted its community services in order to provide a flexible response so that the needs of people with dementia continue to be met during the Covid-19 crisis. Primary care team support is operating nationwide, with referrals being made to community supports, including the ASI&rsquo;s dementia adviser service and the local authority community response forums. While home visits have been necessarily restricted, the HSE uses prioritisation and screening measures to identify clients needing home visits.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and the HSE are undertaking work to determine the current level of service delivery in the community and to set out plans, including associated required capacity, to resume services, including day services, in line with the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. This process will take on board the learning of the current period, including the possibility of delivering services in a new way, and the requirement to adhere to public health guidance. As part of this process, the National Dementia Office is developing a new model of care for dementia.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s Memory Technology Resource Rooms (MTRRs) now have a central line, where people can speak to an occupational therapist for advice on Assistive Technology and aids to support people at home. The majority of MTRRs are now providing an adapted service through telephone and video assessment and consultation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the ASI continues to support people throughout the Covid-19 crisis: its live chat, national helpline, home care, dementia adviser service, and online family carer training all remain up and running. Alzheimer Caf&eacute;s have moved on-line and &lsquo;virtual caf&eacute;s&rsquo; are now taking place. The ASI has launched a new nurse line initiative with backing from the HSE and the Department of Health. The free call-back service offers people with dementia and family carers the opportunity to book a 1:1 session with a Dementia Nurse or a Dementia Adviser during the Covid-19 public health emergency. This creates a space for people with dementia and \/ or their families to raise issues that may be arising for them during the cocooning phase of the Covid-19 Emergency. This is hoped to assist people and may help plug the gap where Geriatrician appointments have had to be postponed due to Covid-19.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance for re-opening day centres, including those for people with dementia, has been issued to CHOs.

As issues around the resumption of disability day services are COVID specific, funding was sought from the National Action Plan on COVID-19.<\/p>  <p>  Of this &euro;10 million, &euro;7.5 million will increase disability day services by one day a week for over 14,000 adults. &euro;2.5 million will provide 210 intensive support packages to enable children and young adults to remain at home and in their communities. <\/p>  <p>  The additional funding will further support the resumption of day services, which began to gradually resume throughout August and September. However, it should be noted that capacity in day service locations will be reduced, in line with public health guidance. The HSE and service providers will keep this measure under review and as public health guidance evolves, capacity to provide supports will adapt accordingly. Both the HSE and service providers are committed to maximising the support that can be provided within these restrictions. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Guidance to support the Framework for Resumption of Adult Disability Day Services is available on the New Directions website: www.hse.ie\/newdirections. The HSE have also issued monthly communications updates for service users and their families, and the latest update, a video message from the Head of Strategy and Planning HSE Disability Services, is available at the above link. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  An information portal that contains the dates on which the 966 disability day service locations reopened around the country is available. This information can be accessed at www.hse.ie\/newdirections<\/p>  <p>  With regard to respite services, the HSE&rsquo;s A Safe Return to Health Services outlines a three phased approach to the return of health and social care services. In accordance with this plan, short-stay residential and emergency\/residential respite re-opened from July to August with activity set to increase in the next two phases; September &ndash; November and December 2020 to February 2021. The main assumption underpinning this schedule is the level of illness and health service pressure caused by COVID-19. If this increases in later surges, the timelines in this document will change.<\/p>  <p>  Residential settings are people&rsquo;s homes as well as places where health and social care are provided, and so services and supports for those in long term residential settings continue. Where some regular activities for people with disabilities in long term residential care, such as attending separate day services, are curtailed, alternative supports are provided in the residential setting. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health is very much aware of how difficult restrictions on visiting are for residents and their families, and it is hoped that re-introduction of restrictions can be minimised. As Dublin city and county has been placed on Level 3 of the Framework for Restrictive Measures, it is unfortunately the case that visits to long term residential care facilities are paused until Friday 9th of October, but service providers are asked to take account of exceptional circumstances and facilitate visits on critical or compassionate grounds where needed.

In that time, the primary drivers of increased costs have been:<\/p><p>- Compensation +&euro;6.2 million<\/p><p>- DAFM staff costs and admin +&euro;1.6 million<\/p><p>- DAFM paid TB testing +&euro;1.5 million<\/p><p>Compensation increases largely\u00a0relate to\u00a0higher incidence of disease. DAFM staff cost increases primarily reflect an additional 16 posts sanctioned in 2020 to assist the TB Eradication Programme at an estimated cost of &euro;1 million per annum. Farmers pay their Private Veterinary Practitioner for the annual round test and DAFM pay for all other consequential testing which occurs. The number of consequential tests has increased since 2017 reflecting higher disease incidence. This cost has been met by DAFM.<\/p><p>The TB Programme is financed by farmers, the Exchequer and the EU. Farmer contributions to the Programme since 2017 have been broadly stable reflecting the mechanism through which they contribute to the Programme. Farmer contributions relate to the assumed annual cost to the farmer of TB testing and receipts from bovine disease levies. The contribution from the EU has fallen sharply by &euro;4.4 million between 2017 and 2020 reflecting reduced funding ceilings and penalties related to deteriorating disease incidence. Based on Programme metrics to date for 2020, my Department is expecting a further 20% funding penalty (&euro;1.1 million) to be imposed in respect of 2020. This will be subject to decision by the Commission in mid-2021. <\/p><p>The significant increase in Programme costs allied with reductions in EU funding has seen Exchequer funding of the TB Programme rise from &euro;41.7 million in 2017 to a forecast &euro;57 million in 2020 (+&euro;15.3 million or 37%). This level of increase in\u00a0investment is not sustainable.<\/p><p>I have convened a TB Stakeholder Forum for 1 October which I will attend.

I am acutely conscious that every TB restriction represents a significant challenge to the farm family concerned.\u00a0 I want to work with all stakeholders in ensuring fewer herdowners experience the challenges associated with a TB restriction and that we work purposefully towards eradication of this disease, thus eliminating this on-going cost on farmers and the State.<\/p><p><b>TB Programme Expenditure and Financing<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Expenditure<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Staff   &amp;amp; Admin Costs<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DAFM Staff Costs &amp;amp; Admin<\/td>       <td>&euro;26,924<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,029<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,502<\/td>       <td>&euro;28,500<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Supplies <\/td>       <td>&euro;4,839<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,376<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,426<\/td>       <td>&euro;5,278<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wildlife   Programme<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wildlife Programme<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,465<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,635<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,040<\/td>       <td>&euro;4,568<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>PVP   Testing<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Farmer Paid PVP Testing<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,908<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,746<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,400<\/td>       <td>&euro;27,400<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>DAFM Paid PVP Testing<\/td>       <td>&euro;7,028<\/td>       <td>&euro;7,313<\/td>       <td>&euro;8,541<\/td>       <td>&euro;8,498<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>&euro;34,936<\/td>       <td>&euro;35,059<\/td>       <td>&euro;35,941<\/td>       <td>&euro;35,898<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Compensation   Scheme<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>On Farm Market Valuation<\/td>       <td>&euro;10,500<\/td>       <td>&euro;14,255<\/td>       <td>&euro;14,047<\/td>       <td>&euro;16,388<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Compensation - Other<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,545<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,832<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,674<\/td>       <td>&euro;3,706<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Valuer Fees<\/td>       <td>&euro;539<\/td>       <td>&euro;548<\/td>       <td>&euro;602<\/td>       <td>&euro;740<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Arbitration<\/td>       <td>&euro;15<\/td>       <td>&euro;11<\/td>       <td>&euro;10<\/td>       <td>&euro;10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>&euro;14,599<\/td>       <td>&euro;18,646<\/td>       <td>&euro;18,333<\/td>       <td>&euro;20,845<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Research<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>bTB Research<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,666<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,618<\/td>       <td>&euro;1,136<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,225<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>&euro;86,429<\/td>       <td>&euro;90,363<\/td>       <td>&euro;91,378<\/td>       <td>&euro;97,314<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Financing<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Farmers<\/td>       <td>&euro;34,845<\/td>       <td>&euro;35,101<\/td>       <td>&euro;34,768<\/td>       <td>&euro;34,882<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>EU<\/td>       <td>&euro;9,851<\/td>       <td>&euro;8,773<\/td>       <td>&euro;7,425<\/td>       <td>&euro;5,420<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Exchequer<\/td>       <td>&euro;41,733<\/td>       <td>&euro;46,489<\/td>       <td>&euro;49,185<\/td>       <td>&euro;57,012<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total<\/td>       <td>&euro;86,429<\/td>       <td>&euro;90,363<\/td>       <td>&euro;91,378<\/td>       <td>&euro;97,314<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>Methodology notes:<\/p><p>- DAFM has assumed that farmers privately pay the same rate as the Department to Private Veterinary Practitioners for PVP testing.
