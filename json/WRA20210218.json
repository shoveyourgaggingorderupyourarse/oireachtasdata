Loans of up to &euro;1 million are available for up to five and a half years at reduced interest rates for working capital and investment purposes.  Loans under &euro;250,000 do not require collateral or personal guarantees. <\/p><p>The Scheme was developed in accordance with the European Commission&rsquo;s State Aid Temporary Framework and is available to SMEs, small Mid-Caps and primary producers in a wide range of sectors that meet the eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>While the State provides a guarantee on these loans, the Department plays no role in the application or decision-making process in relation to loans offered under the Scheme, which, is fully delegated to the participating lenders.  There are clear eligibility criteria including a minimum impact of 15 percent on turnover as a result of COVID-19 and a return to viability in the future. These features were set by the European Commission in their State Aid Temporary Framework.  Private finance providers have the widest network and closest relationship with Irish businesses to make these assessments.Where an applicant has had a loan application refused, they may wish to appeal the decision to the Credit Review Office (CRO).  The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by the main banks.  <\/p><p>A key focus of the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme is to make additional lending available to business for liquidity purposes and investment.  It is a matter for individual participating lenders to determine the financial products that they make available under the scheme, with term loans being the dominant product currently being offered.  All finance providers are required to demonstrate reduced interest rates to the participating business.  The latest data in respect of interest rates charged on drawn loans up to the end of January, shows that interest rates range from 2.00% to 3.99%, with 98% of loans provided at an interest rate of between 2.50% and 2.99%. These are significantly reduced rates on commercial loans rates of the same term and size.<\/p><p>Refinancing may be permitted in respect of COVID-19 related expenses that were funded through short term or temporary facilities such as overdrafts.  However, any provision for potential refinancing must have been agreed as part of the initial finance agreement. The wholesale application of refinancing is not permitted within the terms of the scheme as approved under the Temporary Framework.<\/p><p>My Department has worked extremely hard to ensure there is choice out in the market for Irish businesses seeking state supported lending. Since January, 19 Credit Unions and 3 non-bank lenders have successfully joined the CCGS as finance providers. More are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. This long-term policy goal of diversification will add competition in the market and ensure a wide range of loan products being available. I encourage businesses to consult the CCGS pages on the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland&rsquo;s website for a full list of participating finance providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800053#WRA00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Covid-19 Pandemic Supports","counter":7,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800053#WRA00600"},{"type":"question","counter":8,"qnumday":2,"qnumall":"[9065\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800053#WRA00700","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if matters raised in correspondence by a person (details supplied) on casual traders and the Covid-19 business aid scheme will receive a response; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1598","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":9,"content":"<p>I understand this is an incredibly difficult time for businesses and families across the country.<\/p><p>The Government has put in place a comprehensive range of measures to help businesses and workers during the pandemic, including the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS), the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP), the COVID-19 Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS), low-cost loans, the deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities and the waiver of commercial rates.

The majority of enterprise supports are open to all businesses, including SMEs, and not just those that are clients of the enterprise agencies.  In the meantime, my Department is continuing to monitor and work with all sectors in the economy as they experience Brexit fallout while dealing in parallel with COVID-19. <\/p><p>Budget 2021 allocated unprecedented resources to confronting the twin challenges of COVID-19 and Brexit, with &euro;340 million to be spent on Brexit-related measures. Government has also provided for a &euro;3.4 billion recovery fund to assist businesses in the aftermath of COVID-19 and Brexit. A full list of enterprise and financial supports is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at <i>www.enterprise.gov.ie <\/i>and on <i>www.Gov.ie\/Brexit.<\/i><\/p><p>The results of analysis carried out in 2018 and later in January 2020 on the likely impacts of Brexit on key sectors of the Irish economy identified the Agri-Food sector as the sector likely to be the most impacted. In that respect, the recent announcement of the &euro;100 million Capital Investment Scheme for the Processing and Marketing of Agricultural Products, managed by Enterprise Ireland, is just one of the ways the Government is helping the Agri-Food sector manage the fallout from Brexit. <\/p><p>I am committed to ensuring that the most impacted sectors of the economy will be given the State assistance they require. The proposal to allocate &euro;1 billion in the first tranche of the EU Brexit Adjustment Reserve to Ireland is welcome and is strong recognition for the fact that Ireland is one of the most impacted Member States by Brexit. The fund will be used to mitigate the worst impacts of Brexit for the most impacted sectors in the economy.<\/p><p>In relation to consular services overseas, the Deputy can ask for more detailed information from my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. However, the UK is, and will remain, a major market for Irish companies, and expanding the Irish export footprint in markets beyond the UK is a key priority. In that context, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s strategy is to support Irish exporters to be more innovative, competitive and market diversified. <\/p><p>As we continue to address the many challenges and complexities raised by Brexit, it is our intention to maintain our valuable trading relationship with the UK in the years ahead. For that reason, as part of the Global Ireland 2025 Strategy, Enterprise Ireland opened a new office in Manchester in 2019. This new office, which complements the work carried out by the agency in its London office, enables Enterprise Ireland to continue to support Irish companies to consolidate and grow exports to the UK.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Data","counter":39,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02200"},{"type":"question","counter":40,"qnumday":13,"qnumall":"[9316\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which Irish exports to the UK and the European Union have fluctuated since Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":41,"qnumday":14,"qnumall":"[9317\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02400","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which levels of trade between Ireland and the UK, the UK and the EU, excluding Ireland, and each EU country have fluctuated since the imposition of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":42,"qnumday":23,"qnumall":"[9326\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02500","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which trade with non-EU countries including the UK had progressed and continued since 1 January 2021 in the context of Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"question","counter":43,"qnumday":26,"qnumall":"[9329\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which he continues to monitor the import and export sectors with a view to measuring the impact of Brexit and-or Covid-19 on the economy generally if particular issues arise which might require attention in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":44,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 23 and 26 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Statistics Office compiles statistical data on Goods Exports and Imports. The latest figures available relate to exports and imports for the month of December 2020 and for the year 2020.  As statistics are not yet available for the month of January 2021, it is not yet possible to measure any impact on trade between Ireland and the UK, the EU or non-EU countries since 1 January 2021. <\/p>  <p>  The latest Goods Exports and Imports release from the Central Statistics Office, dated 15 February 2021, shows that the value of goods exports from Ireland rose to &euro;160.8bn in 2020 which is the highest level on record.  The value of goods exports increased by &euro;8.3bn or 5.4% when compared to 2019. The total value of imports to Ireland in 2020 was &euro;85,367 million. The value of imports decreased compared to 2019, falling by &euro;5,495 million (-6%).<\/p>  <p>  The EU accounted for &euro;63,859 million (40%) of total exports in 2020, an increase of &euro;7,211 million (+13%) on 2019. The EU accounted for &euro;30,329 million of imports in 2020, representing 36% of total imports. This was a decrease of &euro;2,969 million (-9%) on 2019.  As the UK had exited the EU on January 31st 2020, the data comparing EU trade in 2019 and 2020 excludes the UK for both periods for comparative purposes.<\/p>  <p>  Exports to non-EU countries (excluding the UK) were valued at &euro;82,457 million in 2020, which is an increase of &euro;2,360 million (+3%) on the 2019 level of exports. The US continues to be Ireland&rsquo;s biggest single goods export market, accounting for &euro;49,845 million or 31% of total exports in 2020. Imports from non-EU countries (excluding the UK) totalled &euro;35,522 million in 2020, a decrease of &euro;1,654 million (-4%) on the 2019 level of imports.<\/p>  <p>  Exports to Great Britain in 2020 were valued at &euro;12,399 million, which is a decrease of &euro;1,183 million (-9%) compared with 2019. Exports to Great Britain accounted for 8% of total exports in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Imports from Great Britain in 2020 were &euro;17,812 million, a decrease of &euro;861 million (-5%) when compared with 2019, meaning there was a trade deficit of &euro;5,413 million with Great Britain in 2020. Imports from Great Britain accounted for 21% of total imports in 2020. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to monitor the performance of the import and export sectors as the outlook for exports to the UK, Eurozone and rest of the world is being impacted by both Brexit and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  The long-term response to Brexit is for companies across all sectors to become more competitive, more innovative and to diversify their export footprint into more international markets.  My Department&rsquo;s 2021 budget allocation of &euro;1.13bn represents an increase of &euro;154 million or 15.9% on the 2020 allocation. This is in addition to &euro;100 million earmarked from the Recovery Fund for Brexit. This is a record allocation and will significantly bolster the capability of our enterprise and regulatory agencies to help businesses examine their Brexit exposure, seek advice, avail of customs training and make plans to protect their business.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s ambition for 2021 is to sustain Irish jobs and exports and increase the resilience of the enterprise base with a view to ensuring global exports retain their pre-pandemic, pre-Brexit value of &euro;25.6 bn. The agency&rsquo;s focus will be on supporting clients to adapt and succeed in a post-Brexit environment, sustaining existing export sales and accelerating the diversification of Irish exports. While the UK will remain a major market for Irish companies, expanding the Irish export market in markets beyond the UK will continue to be a priority. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years the majority of Ministerial-led Trade Missions have taken place to the Eurozone, North America and Asia Pacific, which represented the strongest growth opportunities for Irish companies. These Trade Missions focused on promoting the innovative capabilities and competitive offerings of Irish companies to international buyers in sectors including internationally traded services, fintech, high-tech construction, engineering, ICT and lifesciences. In 2020, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, promotion of our companies abroad continued through the work of our State agencies, and, in particular, their offices located on the ground internationally.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently finalising a Ministerial led Trade Mission Programme for 2021. At this stage, it is envisaged that such a programme will contain a mix of virtual and actual trade missions. At the same time, Enterprise Ireland will continue to support companies to sustain their existing export sales and to increasingly diversify their export markets. This will include strengthening sales and marketing capability of companies, with a particular focus on remote\/virtual channels and providing targeted financial and advisory supports to companies adversely impacted upon by COVID-19 and Brexit to support their adaptation to the challenging market environment. <\/p>  <p>  As well as the global efforts supported by our agencies, key to our success in growing exports has been our commitment to trade liberalisation in order to open new markets for our indigenous sectors. With a small domestic market, further expansion in other markets is essential to our continued economic growth and, in this regard, Ireland will continue to support the EU&rsquo;s ambitious programme of negotiating new Free Trade Agreements, opening new markets for Irish companies and increasing export and investment opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Support Services","counter":45,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB02900"},{"type":"question","counter":46,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[9318\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800054#WRB03000","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the extent to which incentives continue to be made available to encourage the manufacturing and services sectors given the impact of both Brexit and Covid-19; if new measures are in mind; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":47,"content":"<p>I am keenly aware that businesses are making a massive sacrifice to protect their communities and I am committed to ensuring that the Government offers as much assistance and support as possible.

The latest EPA projections show that emissions from those sectors of the economy covered by our targets could be between 2-4% below 2005 levels.

I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 crisis. In April of last year, all major telecommunications providers in Ireland committed to a number of measures to help people stay in touch and work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since then, a number of operators have implemented further supports for consumers, such as for students in education, who require a high data usage package, by increasing data limits on many existing packages and by the introduction of new packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings. As a result, the market for mobile packages with very high, or unlimited data offerings, is becoming increasingly competitive, which is a positive development for consumers.<\/p><p>Those commitments were further supported through regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926, enabling ComReg to release additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis. Ministerial consent was granted for this framework proposed by the regulator to provide flexibility for mobile network operators to create additional capacity for mobile phone and broadband services and accommodate the increased demand due to Covid 19 related working and studying from home. Licences were issued to three mobile network operators for three months, renewable again for three months. A further temporary licencing framework was put in place in October with licences issued to three operators for three months. Those licences were renewed again in December and are valid to 1 April 2021. <\/p><p>As set out in the Programme for Government, ensuring access to high-quality internet connections for people across Ireland is essential to the development of all parts of our country, socially and economically. Facilitating remote working and innovation opportunities is essential for addressing climate change, adapting in an evolving economy, and competing internationally. So as to ensure that nobody is left behind in a digital divide, the National Broadband Plan (NBP) State led Intervention will be delivered by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) to roll out a high speed and future proofed broadband network within the Intervention Area which covers 1.1 million people living and working in the nearly 540,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms along with 695 schools.<\/p><p>There are a total of 95,188 premises in County Kildare of which 81,329 premises (85%) are served by commercial operators and 13,859 premises (15%) are in the National Broadband Plan Intervention Area.

The majority of these chargers have been rolled out by the ESB through its eCars programme, with some public chargers being provided by local authorities, retail outlets and private companies.<\/p>  <p>  The Climate Action Fund (CAF) has also allocated up to &euro;10 million to a project from ESB eCars that will further enhance its current network and complete a nationwide EV charging network capable of facilitating large-scale electric vehicle uptake over the next decade. In addition to the CAF project, the Government is also providing support for home charging and on-street charging.<\/p>  <p>  Home charging is considered the primary method of charging for the majority of EVs in Ireland and is a convenient, cost effective and environmentally-friendly means of charging, especially when using night-rate electricity. It accounts for circa 80% of EV charging sessions and will continue to be the primary method of charging in the future. The EV Home Charger Grant Scheme has been in operation since January 2018 to support the installation of home chargers for purchasers of new and second-hand BEVs and PHEVs.  The grant provides generous support towards the full cost of installation of a home charger, up to a maximum of &euro;600. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, work is being progressed to expand the EV Home Charger Grant to include shared parking (e.g. in apartment blocks). There are a number of complex planning issues to address before it will be possible to expand this grant and the Department and the SEAI are working to address the issues involved. <\/p>  <p>  Since September 2019, the Public Charge Point Scheme has been in place to provide funding to local authorities for the development of on-street public chargers. The primary focus of this scheme is to provide support for the installation of infrastructure which will facilitate those owners of EVs who do not have access to a private parking space but rely on parking their vehicles on public streets to charge their EVs near their homes.  Infrastructure installed could also provide the opportunity for people visiting the area to park and charge their EVs. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Department is also making &euro;2 million available this year through the SEAI to support the installation of destination charge points in locations such as hotels and shopping centres. This new initiative will help provide another critical link in the overall network for public charging.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government published in June last year, commits to publishing an electric vehicles infrastructure strategy. Once completed, the strategy will provide a key framework for ensuring we continue to have sufficient infrastructure in place to keep ahead of demand, while also ensuring that appropriate planning and development guidelines are followed in providing the necessary capacity. It is envisaged that the strategy will be published this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800057#WRE05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Licences","counter":234,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800058#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":235,"qnumday":83,"qnumall":"[9261\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800058#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"his plans regarding an extension to the driver licence renewal dates; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1564","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":236,"content":"<p>Due to the resurgence of Covid 19 in Europe as well as in Ireland, the extension of driving licences is currently under consideration at EU level.

Revenue have confirmed that PAYE workers using their primary residence as a workplace during Covid-19 restrictions qualify as e-workers for the purposes of this practice.  <\/p><p>This administrative practice has been in place for some time and the choice of whether to make the payment of &euro;3.20 is at the discretion of the employer.  The value of relief allowed under the Irish system is already considered sufficient to cover any legitimate additional costs incurred by workers.  The level of support allowed also compares favourably internationally: at &euro;3.20 per day up to &euro;16 per week or &euro;832 per annum may be paid tax free.  For comparison purposes, the weekly rate in the UK is just &pound;6 per week or a maximum of &pound;312 per annum. <\/p><p>Revenue also advise that the provision of equipment, such as computers, printers, scanners and office furniture by the employer to enable the employee work from home will not attract a Benefit-In-Kind charge, where the equipment is provided primarily for business use.

In preparation for last year&rsquo;s Budget, my Department, along with the ESRI, conducted an analysis of the sectoral overlap between the two shocks. The analysis found that the sectors most exposed to both Covid-19 and a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit appear to be distinct and relatively unconnected. While the analysis was based on the assumption of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit, this general conclusion is still applicable today. <\/p>  <p>  Although the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK provides for zero-tariffs and zero-quotas for qualifying goods, it will nevertheless introduce trade frictions in the form of non-tariff barriers.  It is also a considerable &lsquo;step-down&rsquo; in terms of services trade relative to the previous EU-UK relationship, which is significant as Ireland exports considerably more services than goods to the UK. Therefore, while the agreement protects Irish firms from the more significant impact of a &lsquo;disorderly&rsquo; Brexit scenario, they will still be impacted by the change in trading arrangements. Thus, it represents a smaller Brexit shock for the same sectoral mix of Irish firms as under a no-deal scenario. <\/p>  <p>  Using this analysis, my Department&rsquo;s Budget 2021 forecasts accounted for the dual impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; Brexit on the Irish economy. However, the earlier than anticipated roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines and the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the UK represent upsides to the outlook this year, though the re-introduction of Level 5 restrictions will have an offsetting negative effect. <\/p>  <p>  The government has provided an enormous amount of fiscal support in response to the Covid-19 and Brexit crises. At just under &euro;40 billion, the cumulative level of fiscal support made available in 2020 and 2021 has been unprecedented. Using counter-cyclical fiscal policy in this way has been the most appropriate course of action and was made possible only by the prudent management of the public finances in recent years.

I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market. <\/p>  <p>  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank. <\/p>  <p>  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts.

","asker":"1604","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":274,"content":"<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is a social welfare payment for workers who have become unemployed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PUP payments are classified in legislation as income supports and are subject to income tax. The taxation arrangements for the PUP were legislated for in Finance Act 2020 which reflects the standard approach to taxation of social welfare type payments, which means they are liable to income tax but exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC) and Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI).<\/p><p>The PUP along with the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) were introduced in March 2020 as emergency measures to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The Government objective at that time was to get much needed assistance to employees as quickly as possible. To meet that objective, both subsidies were not taxed in &lsquo;real-time&rsquo; in the normal manner, meaning the collection of any tax due was deferred until year end. This approach was based on an expectation at the time that the emergency supports would be short-term in nature, which turned out to not be the case due to the continued prevalence of COVID-19. <\/p><p>The replacing of the TWSS with the EWSS from 1 September 2020 and the continuation of both that scheme and the PUP into 2021 has re-established the practice of operating PAYE in the normal (real-time) manner for such payments. However, those people receiving PUP payments in 2021 will only pay tax when they return to work. The mechanism to tax PUP payments is by reducing the recipient&rsquo;s tax credits and rate bands. Revenue has published information on the taxation of the PUP at the following link<b><\/b><i>www.revenue.ie\/en\/life-events-and-personal-circumstances\/pup-tax-liability\/index.aspx<\/i>,<b><\/b>which may be of interest to the Deputy.<\/p><p>When a PUP recipient returns to work, he or she should immediately cease the PUP claim with the Department of Social Protection (DSP). In turn, DSP will notify Revenue that the payment has ceased, and Revenue will then adjust the employee&rsquo;s tax credits accordingly. For a person in receipt of the PUP at the start of the year, the weekly amount is annualised on the Tax Credit Cert (TCC), with knock on impacts on the tax credit and standard rate cut off point, as if that person will be on the PUP for the full year. When the person comes off PUP, the TCC is amended to reflect the fact that the payment has ceased. A revised instruction (Revenue Payroll Notification) will issue to the relevant employer to reflect the updated position and the revised TCC will issue to the employee via the online myAccount service. <\/p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that income tax is normally calculated using the <i>&lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;<\/i>, which means that for each pay day, all earnings and all tax credits are accumulated, and the tax due is calculated on a year to date basis. This ensures employees pay the correct amount of tax as it falls due. In exceptional circumstances, employees may be placed on the <i>&lsquo;Week 1&rsquo;<\/i>basis (also known as the &lsquo;non-cumulative basis&rsquo;). This normally occurs where there is a large reduction in tax credits that could cause financial hardship or where there is a lack of information on prior employments within the current tax year. Where employees are placed on a <i>&lsquo;Week 1&rsquo;<\/i>basis, income tax is deducted on a pay-period to pay-period arrangement, without reference to previous pay or tax paid. As such, the employee will not suffer a large deduction of tax in a pay-period but will also not receive any refunds that might be due until the <i>&lsquo;cumulative basis&rsquo;<\/i>is implemented. These normal taxing arrangements are operating in respect of PUP payments received by employees in 2021 and are in accordance with the legislation as set down. <\/p><p>Specifically, regarding the taxation of PUP, the following points are also relevant:<\/p><p>- A single person currently in receipt of the PUP will continue to receive the payment gross and tax is not collected from these payments until s\/he returns to work. This is also the case where both married spouses\/civil partners are receiving PUP;<\/p><p>- 50% of all PUP recipients are not on the highest rate of &euro;350 per week. A single person&rsquo;s weekly tax credits will fully cover any tax due on weekly PUP payments at the &euro;203, &euro;250 and &euro;300 payment rates. For these rates, the employee will in fact have excess weekly tax credits of between &euro;3.46 and &euro;22.86 which will build up for the period s\/he is out of work. This means that the employee will have additional tax credits to offset against income when s\/he returns to work;<\/p><p>- For a single person in receipt of PUP of &euro;350 per week, his\/her weekly tax credits cover 90% of the tax payable, leaving tax due of approximately &euro;6.50 per week.<\/p><p>- USC is not chargeable on PUP payments which will either fully or partially offset any tax impact on overall net wages. <\/p><p>Revenue advise me that, for example, if a single person is in receipt of the PUP from January 2021 to end of February 2021 before then returning to work (i.e. 8 payments of PUP at &euro;350 per week = &euro;2,800) the total outstanding tax due on the payments received at that point is approximately &euro;52. By adjusting the employee&rsquo;s tax credits, as outlined above, this, eliminates or reduces any liability at year end. Any such liability will also be fully or partly offset by the reduction in the total USC liability for the year because, as explained above, PUP payments are not liable to USC. In effect, this means that in most cases the net take home pay of PUP recipients that return to employment will be unaffected by the taxation measures.<\/p><p>The position for married couples\/civil partners is slightly different. Where a couple is taxed under joint assessment and one spouse or civil partner is in receipt of the PUP but does not have sufficient tax credits to cover the tax due, the tax credits of the working spouse or civil partner are reduced to ensure that the balance of the tax is collected during the year. Effectively, the personal tax credit of the PUP recipient is not assigned to the working spouse in the usual manner as it is instead allocated to the excess PUP amount over and above the (PUP) recipient&rsquo;s PAYE tax credit and rate band. <\/p><p>Finally, Revenue further advise me that in taxing PUP payments in accordance with the legislation, Revenue is seeking to ensure, as far as possible, that people do not end up with a tax liability at the end of 2021 that will have to be paid in future years, particularly where there is already an underpayment in respect of 2020. The alternative &lsquo;year-end&rsquo; approach would result in employees having further underpayments in the years ahead in addition to their 2020 liabilities, which could cause financial difficulties for them down the road. The normal deduction arrangements now applying to both EWSS and PUP for 2021 insures against this, as tax credits are set aside for offset against any tax due. The arrangement also ensures an equity of tax treatment between those receiving the PUP and employees who are working and receiving similar levels of wages (although the person on PUP will have a lower USC liability).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800058#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800058#WRF04300"},{"type":"question","counter":276,"qnumday":96,"qnumall":"[9190\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800058#WRF04400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the position of the Central Bank on the proposed shared equity loan scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":277,"content":"<p>The Affordable Purchase Shared Equity Scheme is a policy initiative which falls under the remit of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage following the allocation of &euro;75m of funding as part of Budget 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been providing on-going support and assistance to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Housing Agency in relation to the development of the scheme including interacting with the Central Bank, the Banking and Payments Federation (BPFI) and the participating banks.

I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news.  The production and publication of newspapers, journals and periodicals and the distribution of those publications has been listed as an essential service. <\/p>  <p>  The sector faces a fall in revenue arising from the pandemic, but also longer term challenges as a result of changing patterns of media consumption, technology and shifts in advertising revenue. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of these longer term challenges, the Programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast, and online media in a platform agnostic fashion.  The Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, recently concluded a public consultation to which a number of stakeholders in the print sector have made submissions. The Commission is currently in the process of engaging with key stakeholders in a series of thematic dialogues. I look forward to receiving the Commission's Report on the completion of its work which will inform media policy, including print media, over the next 10 years. <\/p>  <p>  In terms of specific supports for the sector, the Deputy will appreciate it is of particular importance in relation to media organisations to avoid any perception of Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. Commercial radio is supported by a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. There is no equivalent statutory scheme for the print sector and the BAI has no function in funding the print sector.<\/p>  <p>  I am however cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. The Government has put in place a range of supports for all businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which are available to local newspapers.<\/p>  <p>Since I assumed formal responsibility for the media sector in September 2020, I have engaged in meeting key stakeholders including Newsbrands, Local Ireland and the National Union of Journalists (NUJ).  Work is continuing to explore the issues arising, with a follow up meeting between my officials and the NUJ taking place on 3rd February. I had  a further meeting with Local Ireland on Wednesday 17th  February and I have asked my officials to continue engagement with Local Ireland to further explore the issues facing the sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800059#WRG02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Capital Programme","counter":314,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800059#WRG02700"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[9099\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800059#WRG02800","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason a grant to a club (details supplied) has still not been paid despite all documentation being provided; if she will progress the matter given the impact it is having on the club; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1592","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>The club referred to by the Deputy received a provisional allocation of &euro;76,754 under the 2018 Sports Capital Programme (SCP).

With very limited exemptions, these apply to all private rented residential accommodation.   <\/p>  <p>  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties, regardless of tenancy type, comply with these regulations. Responsibility for the enforcement of the Regulations rests with the relevant local authority. <\/p>  <p>  Anyone &ndash; a tenant, a neighbour or another landlord - can and should report suspected cases of non-compliance to the Local Authority, which will then inspect the property and, if it is found not to meet the standards, will take action to ensure compliance with the regulations.<\/p>  <p>  If an inspection identifies that a property has been found to be non-compliant with the Regulations, it is a matter for the Local Authority to determine the necessary and appropriate actions to take, including the issuing of an Improvement Letter, Improvement Notice and Prohibition Notice, and the initiation of legal action.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has made significant Exchequer funding available to local authorities in recent years, with the result that the number of inspections undertaken more than doubled from 19,645 in 2017 to 40,998 in 2019. Pandemic restrictions reduced the number of inspections carried out in 2020 and in response, some local authorities have been piloting virtual inspections. This initiative entails landlords receiving a checklist for self-assessment and being required to submit photographic\/video evidence by email, tenants being invited to raise any non-compliance issues they are aware of and being asked to confirm that any remedial works requested by the local authority have been completed, and the Council reserving the right to conduct a physical on-site inspection when it is safe to do so. <\/p>  <p>  While virtual inspection systems present certain challenges and limitations, they do offer a way of improving the standard of rental accommodation despite the pandemic. I support these initiatives and my Department is encouraging local authorities not involved in the pilots to consider adopting them. I have committed to providing Exchequer funding for those that do.<\/p>  <p>  In order to assist local authorities increase inspection rates and strengthen compliance, an increased budget of &euro;10m has been approved for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Programme for Government, Our Shared Future, commits to reducing and preventing homelessness and provides detail on how the Government is approaching this work as a priority. Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery.  Therefore, a whole of Government approach is required in dealing with this challenge. However, important progress is being made.  There were 8,200 individuals accessing homeless emergency accommodation at the end of 2020, a decrease of 1,531 individuals, or 15.7%, on the 9,731 total recorded at end of 2019.  The decrease in family homelessness was more pronounced. The year-on-year position is that December 2020 showed a decrease of 578 families, or 37.3%, on the 1,548 total recorded in December 2019. This represents the lowest number of families in emergency accommodation since March 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Increasing the supply of housing, particularly new build social and affordable homes, is a priority for me and for this Government. The Programme for Government commits to increasing the social housing stock by more than 50,000, with an emphasis on new builds. In Budget 2021, this objective was backed with funding of &euro;3.3 billion for the delivery of housing.  Subject to the impact of the Covid related restrictions on the construction sector, the available funding will deliver 12,750 new social homes through build, acquisition and leasing.  A major focus of this investment is the delivery of new build, with an overall target of 9,500 new homes. The increased targets will see increased local authority build on local authority land.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, it is open to anyone to apply for social housing support, applications for which are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended. <\/p>  <p>  If a household meets the eligibility and need criteria, it qualifies for the suite of social housing supports, including HAP, and is placed on the housing list to be considered for the allocation of suitable tenancies in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Planning Issues","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH00800"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[9088\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH00900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the reason for the &euro;20 fee for members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to submit planning observations given it is free for councillors.","asker":"1476","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>The Planning and Development (Amendment)(Fees) Regulations 2018 amended article 168 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 to provide that the fee for making a submission or observation to a planning authority in respect of a planning application shall not be payable by a member of a local authority acting in his or her capacity as a member.

For instance, earlier this week in a discussion with the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of Myanmar, Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener called on the Myanmar military to refrain from violence and fully respect human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. Ireland continues to monitor the situation closely and engage with the EU Delegation and Head of Mission in Myanmar via our Embassy in Bangkok.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that the authorities in Myanmar respond appropriately to these events and that people in Myanmar are free to peacefully and safely express their views. It is vitally important that the military in Myanmar exercise restraint.<\/p>  <p>Ireland continues to work with EU partners and other like-minded countries in responding to the events since 1 February and is committed to ensuring that any course of action is appropriate; works to restore the democratic path in Myanmar and does not negatively impact developmental gains or exacerbate the humanitarian situation. At a political level, Myanmar will be a point of discussion at the Foreign Affairs Council next week. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, along with our EU colleagues, has been a steadfast supporter of Myanmar&rsquo;s civilian and democratic transition, its peace process and national reconciliation, and its inclusive socio-economic development. These are roles we want to continue to assume during this challenging period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH05500"},{"type":"question","counter":396,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[9129\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH05600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the contact details for the sections that deal with all ongoing and established grant funding in his Department and in each agency under the remit of his Department in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":397,"content":"<p>The contact details for all ongoing and established grant funding in my Department are set out in the table below.<\/p><p>There are no agencies under the remit of the Department.<\/p><p> <table>    <tr>       <th>Name of Fund <\/th>       <th>Website Address <\/th>       <th>Email Address <\/th>       <th>Further contact information<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Civil Society Project Funding <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>Dedicated email address supplied at time of call for proposals. <\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Civil Society Programme Funding <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>Dedicated email address supplied at time of call for proposals. <\/td>       <td> <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Humanitarian Funding <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>Dedicated email address supplied at time of call for proposals. <\/td>       <td> <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Development Education Funding <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>Dedicated email address supplied at time of call for proposals. <\/td>       <td> <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Emigrant Support Programme<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>01 4082000 (please ask for the Emigrant Support Programme in the Irish Abroad Unit)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Reconciliation Fund<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>reconciliation@dfa.ie<\/td>       <td>01 4082000 (please ask for the Reconciliation Section in IUKA Division)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Communicating Europe Initiative(Annual scheme due to be launched Feb\/Mar 2021) <\/td>       <td>www.dfa.ie<\/td>       <td>cei@dfa.ie <\/td>       <td>01 4082764 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Access Europe Programme managed by The Wheel.(EU Funding service for Irish Civil Society) <\/td>       <td>www.accesseurope.ie <\/td>       <td>Please use &lsquo;contact us&rsquo; form on website <\/td>       <td>www.accesseurope.ie <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Africa Day <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>africaday@dfa.ie <\/td>       <td>01 4082000<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>The Simon Cumbers Media Fund <\/td>       <td> <\/td>       <td>info@simoncumbersmediafund.ie <\/td>       <td>01 4200580 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800060#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Human Rights","counter":399,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ00200"},{"type":"question","counter":400,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[9185\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ00300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on and response to the ongoing farmer protests in New Delhi, India; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":401,"content":"<p>I have been informed by our Embassy in New Delhi about recent protests by farmers in India against legislation which was passed by the Indian Parliament last September with the stated aim of reforming India's agricultural markets.

His appointment as Minister of State and the responsibilities being assigned to him were announced at that time.  On 17 November, 2020, he was assigned an additional role as Minister of State at the Department of Defence solely to fill a position as a member of the Council of Defence.  The requirement for a Minister of State for Defence, in this regard, arises from the provisions of section 11 of the Defence Act, 1954 on the establishment of the Council for Defence.  No functions of the Minister for Defence have been delegated to the Minister of State and full responsibility for defence policies, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces remains with Minister Coveney who will continue to represent Defence at Cabinet.  As this is essentially a technical appointment with no delegation of functions, no specific announcement was made at the time.<\/p>  <p>  Minister of State Chambers has engaged in a number of meetings in relation to defence matters since his appointment.  At none of those meetings was he discharging functions in respect of Defence Policy generally or the business of the Department or the Defence Forces.  As I understand it, he was familiarising himself with Defence stakeholders, receiving briefs on defence issues and Defence Forces operations in the context of his membership of the Council of Defence.  As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, his membership of the Council would benefit from some knowledge of Defence and current issues in that regard.  I understand that the meetings attended on the relevant dates included a meeting with the Secretary General and the Management Board of my Department, a briefing on the Defence Forces Joint Task Force on Covid in McKee Barracks, a party policy discussion on defence and a meeting with PDFORRA.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 February, 2021, the Minister of State met virtually with the new British Ambassador to Ireland, His Excellency Mr Paul Johnston.  This was one of a number of introductory meetings the newly appointed Ambassador has had with various Ministers and Officials.  The meeting with Minister of State Chambers touched on all areas of the Minister of State&rsquo;s responsibilities, including sports, the Gaeltacht, parliamentary business and defence and the discussion was of a general nature.  The Ambassador was accompanied by his Defence Attach&eacute; and the Minister of State was accompanied by an official from my Department at the meeting.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to establish an independent Commission on the Defence Forces and on completion of the Commission&rsquo;s work that a permanent pay review body for the Permanent Defence Force will be established. The Commission has been established and is due to report by the end of 2021.  The Terms of Reference for the Commission on the Defence Forces state: &ldquo;Upon completion of the Commission&rsquo;s work, the Minister for Defence will consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the establishment of a permanent pay review body, reflecting the unique nature of military service in the context of the public service. All recommendations by the Commission or the successor body and their implementation must be consistent with national public sector wage policy.&rdquo;  While I am aware of the reports referenced by the Deputy in his question, I can confirm that no functions in this regard have been delegated to the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":428,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ03900"},{"type":"question","counter":429,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[9124\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ04000","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the contact details for the sections that deal with all ongoing and established grant funding in his Department and in each agency under the remit of his Department in tabular form.","asker":"1514","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":430,"content":"<p>My Department provides grant funding to local authorities in relation to running costs for Civil Defence.

Deputy that a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 have been commenced. The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing.<\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council. <\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>- an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required, to implement the outstanding sections of the Act, would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800061#WRJ05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":445,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800062#WRK00800"},{"type":"question","counter":446,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[9007\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800062#WRK00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"when the Statement of Strategy 2021 to 2023 will be published by her Department; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":447,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that, in line with the provisions of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, a draft of a new Statement of Strategy for the three year period from 2021 to 2023 was provided to me by my Department in December 2020.  <\/p><p>Discussions regarding the draft are ongoing and it will be finalised shortly.

The early reopening of schools is a key priority for Government.<\/p><p>Government and my Department have invested heavily in schools to support them throughout this pandemic and has sought to plan for, and prioritise, the return to school for children with special educational needs, at the earliest possible time.<\/p><p>A framework has now been developed and agreed with all partners, including unions and management, in order to achieve a phased return to in-school provision for children with special educational needs.  <\/p><p>Under the framework, the following phased return to in-school provision has been agreed: <\/p><p>Phase 1: Special schools have reopened from Thursday 11th February 2021. In accordance with this agreement pupils will attend on a 50 per cent basis to allow for attendance of reduced numbers within the school setting. This will be reviewed in line with public health advice. <\/p><p>Phase 2: Primary and Post Primary Special Classes will reopen from Monday 22nd February 2021. <\/p><p>Pupils with special educational needs who do not attend special schools or classes will continue to be supported remotely by their mainstream class teachers, and by Special Education Teachers, pending their return to school.<\/p><p>My Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period including support material has specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>This guidance is available at:<\/p><p>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Pupils with Special Educational Needs for Primary Schools <\/p><p>Guidance on Continuity of Schooling: Supporting Students with Special Educational Needs for post-primary schools<\/p><p>The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.<\/p><p>It sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher&rsquo;s knowledge of their pupils&rsquo; priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment. <\/p><p>Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.<\/p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.<\/p><p>I can also confirm, however, that in recognition of the fact that remote learning is particularly challenging for children with special educational needs, my Department is also putting in place a supplementary programme to support the education and\/or care needs of pupils with complex needs. <\/p><p>An allocation of five hours per week of home-based teaching or care supports will be made available to eligible pupils. <\/p><p>This allocation is intended to supplement, and not replace, the remote teaching provided by the pupil&rsquo;s school and can be provided by a teacher or SNA in a student&rsquo;s home, at evenings and weekends. Participation in the programme is voluntary for families, teachers and SNAs and must be delivered in accordance with Public Health Advice. <\/p><p>It is intended that this programme would be supported by teachers and SNAs who may opt in to participate, on a paid basis, to help ensure a better learning experience for these pupils and to build on the learning taking place as part of the remote provision.  <\/p><p>The pupils who will be eligible include - <\/p><p>All pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes <\/p><p>Pupils in mainstream schools who are accessing the highest level of the continuum of support (i.e. School Support Plus\/for a Few). This will include pupils with Autism, Down syndrome, sensory impairments, and other disabilities who were identified for the summer programme of 2020.<\/p><p>Pupils identified by their school as requiring the highest level of support at any given time. This will ensure that pupils presenting with exceptional needs due to the current school closures can participate in the scheme. <\/p><p>My Department&rsquo;s approach is intended to be flexible so as to maximise the number of pupils participating.  <\/p><p>An allocation of a 5-hour per week home-based teaching or care support programme will be made available to eligible pupils. This allocation is intended to supplement (and not replace) the remote teaching provided by the pupil&rsquo;s school.  <\/p><p>It is intended that this programme will operate 4 weeks commencing 11th February<\/p><p>This scheme will provide an additional type of support for parents and families who may find it difficult to engage with remote learning.<\/p><p>I am therefore pleased to be able to advise that considerable progress has been made to ensure that children with special educational needs can begin to return to school. <\/p><p>I can also confirm that talks will continue with stakeholders, on further phases of return, so that a wider reopening can be delivered for children as soon as possible. <\/p><p>In the interim, there are no plans to change the current criteria by which Special Education Teachers are allocated to schools.

The commenced provisions include those establishing the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and those providing for an inclusive approach to the education of children with special educational needs.<\/p><p>The following sections of the EPSEN Act were commenced in 2005. <\/p><p>Section 1 &ndash; Interpretation<\/p><p>Section 2 - providing for the inclusive education of children with Special Educational Needs<\/p><p>Section 14 &ndash; placing certain duties on schools<\/p><p>Sections 19 to 37 - placing the Council on a statutory footing. <\/p><p>Section 39 - placing certain duties on Health Boards<\/p><p>Sections 40 to 53 - amending the Education Act<\/p><p>Schedule 1 &ndash; providing for meetings and membership of the Council<\/p><p>Schedule 2 providing for the Chief Executive Officer of the Council.<\/p><p>The remaining sections of the Act have yet to be commenced.  The Sections of the EPSEN Act which have not been implemented are those which would have conferred a statutory entitlement to &ndash; <\/p><p>- an educational assessment for all children with special educational needs. <\/p><p>- consequent development of a statutory individual educational plan (IEP).<\/p><p>- the delivery of detailed educational services on foot of this plan.<\/p><p>- an independent appeals process.<\/p><p>The NCSE estimated, in its Plan for the Implementation of the EPSEN Act Report, which was published in 2006, that additional investment over a period of years of up to &euro;235m per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act. <\/p><p>The view of my Department, at the time, was that the level of investment required could be significantly greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report. Legal advice also indicated that the EPSEN Act, as it is currently constituted, may not be implemented on a phased, or age cohort, basis.<\/p><p>Revised estimates of the amount of additional expenditure required to fully implement the remaining sections of the EPSEN Act, including the individual sections of the Act referred to by the Deputy, have not recently been conducted. The estimated level of additional expenditure required to implement the outstanding sections of the Act would have to take into account annual demographic growth and service developments in the area of special educational needs, pricing adjustments and salary cost differentials on an ongoing basis. Estimates would also have to be made as to the number of pupils who may now currently qualify for the statutory service provisions envisaged by the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to helping every child, particularly those with special educational needs, to fulfil their potential. <\/p><p>In 2021 the Department of Education and Skills will invest approximately &euro;2 Billion in the area of special educational needs support - 1\/5 of the Department's budget and up over 42% since 2011.<\/p><p>The Government has committed to consulting with stakeholders on how best to progress aspects of the EPSEN Act on a non-statutory basis.  <\/p><p>A range of consultations with Education Partners and Stakeholders took place in relation to the development of a new model for allocating special education teachers over the course of 2017. The new model was introduced for all schools from September 2017. <\/p><p>Further consultations took place with education partners and stakeholders in the context of the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and will continue in relation to the implementation of recommendations contained in this report. <\/p><p>Additional powers have also been provided to the National Council for Special Educational to designate a school place for a person with special educational needs, which is now provided for in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. <\/p><p>While awaiting the full implementation of the EPSEN Act, the NCSE has also published a number of policy advice papers which make recommendations aimed at developing a better or more effective alternative to the current resource allocation model, and which aims to move the system towards ultimate implementation of the EPSEN Act.<\/p><p>It should also be noted, however, that since EPSEN was enacted, the Department&rsquo;s policy on supporting children with special educational needs has changed and evolved on foot of evidence based policy advice from the NCSE which takes account of international perspectives. <\/p><p>Significantly, the focus of special needs education provision has changed from a model that is diagnosis led to one which is driven by the needs of the child.  This is a substantially different view to the one underlying the EPSEN Act.  The levels of investment by Government in special education has increased to facilitate the underlying reforms required to implement and embed the needs based approach.  <\/p><p>This Government will continue to prioritise investment in the area of special education support. Ongoing investment and reform will continue to see improvements made in this area.<\/p><p>I have also indicated that one of my priorities as Minister for Special Education and Inclusion is:<\/p><p>Updating our Laws: Reviewing and updating the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act. <\/p><p>Any review of the Act will take into account the extent of additional investment which has been made in special educational services since 2004, with some &euro;2 Billion per year now being spent of special educational supports. <\/p><p>It will also take into account the range of reforms which have taken place in recent years including the development of new allocation models which are not based primarily on a response to assessment as policy advice has indicated that requirement of diagnosis can create a risk of children being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than for health reasons. Also, that as there is a spectrum of ability and disability within every special education disability category, account must be taken of need, as well as diagnosis<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800062#WRK03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Legal Costs","counter":472,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800062#WRK03600"},{"type":"question","counter":473,"qnumday":172,"qnumall":"[9038\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800062#WRK03700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the legal costs incurred by her Department arising from litigation involving children with special educational needs for each of the years 2015 to 2020 and to date in 2021, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1577","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":474,"content":"<p>It should be noted by the Deputy that my Department does not initiate such proceedings and cases are generally only litigated where no potential settlement is acceptable to both sides and the Government's authority to decide issues of education policy is in question.

A High Court case which was subsequently successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal resulted in significant delays in 2019. As well as this, a significant backlog has built up regarding the granting of citizenships due to the inability to hold in person ceremonies during the pandemic, which has prevented the holding of such ceremonies.  These are usually attended by hundreds of new citizens and have become a welcome addition to our public and civic life.<\/p>  <p>  The combined impact of the Jones judgment and the Covid-19 disruption has resulted in the loss of over six months processing time.  As a result, the processing timeline for standard applications has increased.<\/p>  <p>  Quite aside from those specific issues, for a broad range of reasons, some cases will take longer than others to process. Processing timescales can be impacted by incomplete applications having to be returned; further documentation being required from the applicant; where the payment of the required certificate fee is awaited; or if the applicant has not been engaging with the Immigration Service. <\/p>  <p>  In some instances, the input of several government agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction is needed and the request and receipt of information from these sources can result in delays in processing some applications. Issues can also arise at the final stage of the naturalisation process, for example, where additional information comes to light which is required to be considered before a final decision is taken.   <\/p>  <p>  With regard to improvements to address these issues, last month, I announced that a temporary system is now in place that will help to significantly clear the backlog over the course of this year. The temporary system enables applicants to complete their naturalisation process by signing a statutory declaration of loyalty. This signed statutory declaration replaces the requirement for citizenship applicants to attend citizenship ceremonies, which have been temporarily suspended during Covid-19. The new system is in place from 18 January 2021, and my Department will communicate with applicants regarding the requirements, on a phased basis over the next few months until in-person citizenship ceremonies are able to recommence. It is expected that the 4,000 applicants currently waiting on naturalisation will have been provided with an opportunity to gain citizenship by the end of March and I am pleased to say that more than 500 certificates have recently issued.   <\/p>  <p>  In addition to the provision of an alternative platform to large-scale citizenship ceremonies, a number of resources and services have been provided in recent years to support applicants for citizenship in their application process:<\/p>  <p>  - The Citizenship website has been significantly revisited with a view to increasing clarity and enhancing the end user experience. The primary focus has been using simple and easy to understand language and expanding and simplifying guidelines. For instance, following analysis of customer feedback, the section on the provision of residency proofs has been expanded and clarified. In addition, guidance for those applying under Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended has been expanded, in direct response to customer feedback.<\/p>  <p>  - Citizenship Division also engages with immigration NGOs in order to tailor information according to the needs of the client base.<\/p>  <p>  - As part of this process, a new online chat conversation application, or &ldquo;Chatbot&rdquo; has recently been introduced. This provides users with an instant response to frequently asked questions and is called Tara. The application mimics real-time text or message exchange with a member of staff and has answered more than 10,000 queries since it was launched in December.<\/p>  <p>  Further plans for the digitalisation of the naturalisation process are well advanced, in line with my plan to significantly modernise the Justice Sector through increased digital and ICT investment. As part of this process:<\/p>  <p>  - Online payments have been trialled for Minor applications and the process is currently being rolled out to Adult applications on a phased basis.<\/p>  <p>  - In addition, the Division is moving from a paper based transaction model currently utilised with the National Vetting Bureau to a digital platform. It is anticipated this will substantially cut application processing times once it is fully operational.<\/p>  <p>  - From 23 November 2020, all adult applicants are required to have an up to date Tax Clearance certificate which is available electronically from the revenue commissioners.<\/p>  <p>  The end result of the digitisation process will be to free up additional resources to focus on enhanced customer service delivery, ensuring the integrity of the process is protected and processing applications in a timely and efficient manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800065#WRN02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Status","counter":612,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800065#WRN02900"},{"type":"question","counter":613,"qnumday":225,"qnumall":"[9072\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800065#WRN03000","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for residency in the case of a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":614,"content":"<p>In response to a notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), written representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.

This Programme is an intensive programme aimed at a certain cohort of sex offenders and like all treatment programmes available for people convicted of sexual violence, it is voluntary in nature.  The Deputy will appreciate that treatment programmes of any kind are generally only effective where the person concerned accepts that their behaviour has caused serious harm and wants to take ownership to change their own behaviour. <\/p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why individual sex offenders do not participate in the Building Better Lives programme and it is important to note that men who are assessed for treatment may be deemed not suitable for the programme. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria for participation includes a prison sentence of 18 months to provide time to complete the programme, admission of sexually harmful behaviour, robustness of mental health, intellectual, social and developmental capacity, some literacy capacity and those not appealing their conviction. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to understand that, while the programme tends to be a particular focus for attention, it is only one of a number of assessment and intervention (treatment) pillars provided by the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service for people convicted of sexual violence.  <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Prison Service provides alternative pathways of intervention for people who are not suitable for, or decline to attend, the Building Better Lives Programme but who are willing to engage in other interventions, in order to facilitate cognitive, emotional and behavioural change and social reintegration and seek to reduce the risk of recidivism and help ex-offenders lead law-abiding lives.<\/p>  <p>  Prison in-reach Psychiatry services are available for stabilisation and maintenance of mental health where a mental health diagnosis is made. A Sex Offender Risk Assessment and Management (SORAM) programme has also been established to support the cooperation and coordination between key statutory organisations involved in managing the risk posed to the community by convicted sex offenders, as well as the Safer Lives Community Group Work Treatment Programme.

GSOC have commenced an investigation under section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, 2005.

The measures in place and the public health advice have been adapted to the changing circumstances and this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. <\/p><p>The various limits at all levels in the Government's Plan and the continuing imposition of public health measures are necessary to reduce transmission of COVID-19 through a reduction in the movement of people, congregation and interactions. <\/p><p>Under the current public health measures at level 5, people should stay at home except for travel for work, education or other essential purposes and are permitted to take exercise within 5km of home.

Vaccination of this group will start in the week beginning the 15th of February.<\/p><p>All of the groups will be covered as further vaccine supplies become available and the immunisation programme is rolled out nationally.<\/p><p>The evidence will be kept under review and the allocation groups may be updated, where necessary, in light of new evidence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800069#WRR05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":868,"qnumday":311,"qnumall":"[9299\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the projected date by which every nursing home will have received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":869,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":871,"qnumday":312,"qnumall":"[9300\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protocol for ensuring that nursing home residents who were originally unable to receive the vaccine whether due to illness or other reasons will receive the vaccine when they are able; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"question","counter":872,"qnumday":313,"qnumall":"[9301\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS00700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the protocol in the case that a nursing home resident is unable to receive the second dose of the vaccine within the recommended 21-day period due to illness or other reasons; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1567","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":873,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together.<\/p><p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Cards","counter":874,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01000"},{"type":"question","counter":875,"qnumday":315,"qnumall":"[9355\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card renewal will be complete in the case of persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":876,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":878,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Greyhound Industry","counter":877,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01300"},{"type":"question","counter":878,"qnumday":316,"qnumall":"[9248\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS01400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the imminent sale of a site (details supplied); the communication he has had with Longford County Council on the further use of the stadium; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":879,"content":"<p>R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann (RC&Eacute;) is a commercial state body, established under the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 chiefly to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry.

The origin, identity, movements and life history of animal(s) consigned to marts, slaughter plants and live export assembly centres are checked against the database before it is permitted to be consigned for movement to another holding, to enter the food chain or export.  <\/p>  <p>  I am not aware of a detailed proposal for a DNA traceability system as referenced by the Deputy, or the costs that might be associated with such a system which would add to the cost of beef production. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Beef Industry","counter":907,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04300"},{"type":"question","counter":908,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[9235\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on a matter (details supplied) regarding the beef task force; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":909,"content":"<p>The members of the Beef Task Force were appointed by former Minster Creed in good faith, as representatives of the sector as a whole, with a view to carrying out the important task of implementing the Beef Sector Agreement of 15th September 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Further to previous engagement with the parties referred to, my view remains that my Department will not and should not be drawn into intra-organisation issues about a change of representation on the Beef Taskforce.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":910,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04600"},{"type":"question","counter":911,"qnumday":327,"qnumall":"[9276\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 331 of 11 February 2021, if his officials assisted garda&iacute; and or were questioned by garda&iacute; in respect of the matters in advance of the Circuit Court adjudication in 2002; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":912,"content":"<p>No records of Department officials being interviewed by the Garda&iacute; in relation to this matter have been located on file in my Department.<\/p><p>I wish to reiterate that the issues raised are a private matter between the persons named and a third party and my Department has no role in this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Horse Racing Industry","counter":913,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS04900"},{"type":"question","counter":914,"qnumday":328,"qnumall":"[9279\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800070#WRS05000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the plans he is putting in place to allow for the recommencement of the point-to-point spring season; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1622","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":915,"content":"<p>Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) is a commercial state body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001, and is responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry. <\/p><p>Government has requested that Point-to-Point racing be discontinued under current regulations relating to COVID-19.

The Department has carried out significant amount of work to substantially mitigate any impact on trade associated with these issues. My Department has now approved 176 UK vehicles, over 500 drivers and 76 transporters. Staff are working at full capacity and extra resources have been assigned to this area.<\/p>  <p>  Further differences which impose additional challenges in trade with GB include a 40-day residency requirement prior to the export of cattle and sheep; animals also cannot have passed through a market but must be consigned directly from farm of origin or through an assembly centre. The department has worked hard to inform all operators of the new conditions with information notices and seminars. <\/p>  <p>  By way of context, less than 1% of Ireland's sheep exports, and 2.4% of cattle exports, went to GB in 2020. Despite these relatively low numbers, the Department is committed to supporting this trade outlet.  There is a tradition of  high value breeding cattle and sheep sold each year from Ireland to buyers in GB. <\/p>  <p>  Cattle exports to NI rose significantly in 2020 &ndash; reaching 64,000 from 34,000 in 2019. This may in some way reflect a reduced export market to Europe generally last year due to reduced demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with overall reduction of some 35,000 bovines from the 2019 figure. Market prospects are still uncertain for 2021 as demand will depend on level of confidence amongst European buyers in the anticipated progress of COVID-19 vaccination in Europe and return to dining out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800071#WRT00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agriculture Industry","counter":926,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800071#WRT00500"},{"type":"question","counter":927,"qnumday":332,"qnumall":"[9294\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021021800071#WRT00600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"his views on the reduced supply and increasing costs of fertiliser products; his plans to take measures to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":928,"content":"<p>I understand that there has been an upward trend in fertiliser prices in recent times.
