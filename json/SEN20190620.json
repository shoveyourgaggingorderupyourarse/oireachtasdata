I ask the Minister to set in motion a process to prioritise a major road scheme for the N26-N58-N5.  This is much-needed strategic infrastructure to provide north-south, east-west connectivity to towns such as Ballina, Crossmolina, Foxford, Swinford and to facilitate traffic from Erris and Belmullet in west Mayo that comes through Ballina.<\/p> <p>This is a very busy road.  The N26-N58-N5 joins Ballina to Castlebar, the two largest towns in the county.  Traffic counts show that every morning this segment of road between the two towns in the busiest.  Multinational employers are predominant and in total there are 12 foreign direct investment, FDI, companies in Mayo, employing 4,800 people.  Over half of the companies are based in Ballina and north Mayo.  This leads to significant traffic as people travel in each direction to go to work.  Coca-Cola and Hollister are major companies based in Ballina.<\/p> <p>The N26-N58-N5 is not up to standard.  The N58, a considerable stretch of road from Foxford to Ballyvary, has now been reduced to a speed limit of 80 km\/h because of road safety concerns.  Equally there are problems on the N26 to Foxford and Swinford.  There are plans for the N5, but I would like to have them linked into the N26-N58 road network.<\/p> <p>In the past, the N26 had been a priority in the national road scheme of Mayo County Council.  That was the case until 2010 when An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused planning permission for N26 stage 2 from Mount Falcon, just outside Ballina, to Bohola on environmental grounds.  The road runs through a special area of conservation, the River Moy, where the Whooper swans spend the winter and it extends to the land either side of the river. <\/p> <p>Ballina, Foxford and to an extent Swinford are located on or beside the River Moy, so one cannot get away from the River Moy special area of conservation.  <\/p> <p>Back in 2011 when I was a Deputy, I managed to secure a commitment from the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, that we should try to find a new route for the N26.  Even though permission for the proposed road was declined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the significance of it has not disappeared.  I am glad to say that in every budget from the Budget Statement of 2012 to date, moneys have been secured to try to find a solution.  We now have a line on the map for the proposed road.  We have gone through a process to allow for the upgrade of the N26.  Thankfully we received planning permission for the upgrade of the worst stretch of the national primary route, from Cloongullane Bridge on the N26 just outside Swinford.<\/p> <p>We are in a situation where we are being crippled by environmental designation.  Thankfully, we overcame the difficulties because I went to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, under whose remit this comes and secured resources to sort out the issues on this small section of road, which was not the main road, to overcome the environmental concerns relating to alluvial woodlands and the freshwater pearl mussel.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michelle Mulherin:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those hurdles were overcome, which shows that it can be done.  The significance of and need for this road are as clear as ever.  A total of &euro;5 million was spent up to 2010 before An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused stage 2 of the N26 road project.  More than &euro;5 million has been spent to date, but there is only planning permission for one section of the N26.  It is clear that there is a problem, but the need for progress is greater than ever.<\/p><p>The project is a priority for multinational companies in the area.  I have spoken to representatives of such companies and know that they would be happy to meet the Minister.

As the area badly needs this road, I ask that the project be looked at with fresh eyes and impetus and that the Minister prioritise it and speak to Transport Infrastructure Ireland about the case I have set out in the limited time I have with the forbearance of the Acting Chairman.  The Minister should meet the significant stakeholders who cannot understand why there is not more emphasis on and priority given to the construction of this road.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#A01000","speaker":"1425","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this very important matter which she has been pursuing with a great deal of energy and vigour for a long time.  I wish to explain that, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding of the national roads programme.  Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and operation of individual roads are matters for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.<\/p> <p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, to which the Senator referred, the national development plan, NDP, has been developed by the Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new national planning framework, NPF.  It provides the strategic and financial framework for TIl&rsquo;s national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  In the ten year period covered by the plan, more than &euro;11 billion will be invested in the road network.<\/p> <p>The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvement projects.  The first covers projects to advance to construction subject to the satisfactory outcome of the project appraisal and development consent approval processes.  The second covers projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stage which are being assessed, with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development.  Overall, TII considers that, taking steady State and public private partnership commitments into account, the indicative NDP budget will allow the projects in the first category to be progressed and a pipeline of projects to be taken through early planning, but it will not be possible to take all pipeline projects through the development consent approval process or to construction stage within the timeframe of the NDP.  Advancing projects in the second pipeline category will, therefore, be subject to prioritisation within the overall national roads programme and funding.<\/p> <p>The preferred route for the proposed N5-N26-N58, Turlough to Bohola and Swinford to Mount Falcon, road improvement scheme was adopted by Mayo County Council in July 2015.  However, TII informed the council that the scheme could not proceed to the next phase, phase 3 design, at the time owing to funding constraints and the requirement for TII to focus on progression of the schemes identified for development during the period of the capital investment plan 2016 to 2021 and, subsequently, the NDP.  TII continues to focus on these key objectives.  In the interim, TII agreed that the N26, Cloongullane bridge realignment, project should progress as a separate minor improvement scheme in order to improve the safety of this substandard section of the route.  The scheme involves the realignment of a 1.8 km section of the N26 at Cloongullane bridge and the construction of a new bridge over the River Moy.  Mayo County Council submitted the scheme and the associated compulsory purchase order to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in November 2016.  An oral hearing on the proposed road development was convened in March 2017 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la confirmed approval for the scheme in December 2018.  Technical consultants procured by the council are undertaking detailed design of the scheme and preparing the tender documents.  It is anticipated that the tender process for the main construction contract will commence before the end of 2019.<\/p> <p>On east-west roads in County Mayo, I am pleased to advise that Mayo County Council has received tenders for the N5, Westport to Turlough, scheme.  It is expected that the contract will be awarded later in 2019.  The project involves the construction of 20.3 km of type 2 dual carriageway from Westport to the east of Castlebar and a 2.5 km single carriageway link to the N59, Westport to Mulranny, national secondary road.  It also includes a 2.5 km upgrade of the existing N59 at Barleyhill, two compact grade separated junctions, including overbridges, two bridges over the Westport to Dublin railway line, 13 road under-over bridges and six roundabouts.  The project will have many benefits for County Mayo, including increased transport efficiency through a reduction in journey times over the length of the scheme, separating local and strategic traffic, improved road safety and a reduction in the number of accidents, as well as enhancing the environmental quality of the towns of Westport and Castlebar by removing through traffic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#B00200","speaker":"1213"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I am well aware of much of the information the Minister has provided, although I thank him for providing it.  This is about providing for proper connectivity for north and east Mayo.  The Minister did not address the issue of grossly inadequate connectivity between Ballina and Castlebar or the reason there is a need for better connectivity east-west from north Mayo.  One would not drive from Westport to Castlebar and on to Ballina or from Ballina to Castlebar in order to leave County Mayo; rather, one would go through Swinford in east Mayo.  With respect, parts of the answer provided by the Minister are not relevant to the question I asked.<\/p> <p>This project is critical, as I hope the Minister recognises.  I appreciate his statutory position, but that is not an acceptable excuse because the answer he has provided fails the people of north and east Mayo, as well as his Independent colleagues on Mayo County Council who are located in the area.  He is failing the people in the Mayo association who live in Dublin, many of them in his constituency, and who see the project as a priority for this vast area of County Mayo.<\/p> <p>County Mayo is not compact; it is a big county with massive potential.  We want to play our part, but this road project needs to be sorted.  Where there is the political will, there is a way.  I am intimately familiar with this and all other roads in County Mayo.  TII has told me that it must receive some political guidance on how it should proceed.  People in County Mayo have been crucified by environmental designation.  I hope the Minister is seriously concerned that more than &euro;10 million has been spent since 2010 and not one sod has been turned to improve any part of a national primary road in the area.  This is crucifying social and economic growth.  Is this not of concern to him?  I am dismayed that he gave me a standard issue answer when I set out an authentic case.<\/p> <p>This road project has been a priority since before 2010.  It is now as important, if not more important, than it was then.  We are trying to hold onto our young people.

I ask the Minister to revisit this issue and listen to the parties concerned.

I want to raise the matter of the work IDA Ireland is doing in counties Roscommon and Galway.  It is an issue the Minister of State is well aware of as he visited the IDA Ireland business park in Ballinasloe recently.  IDA Ireland's quarterly results will be published later this morning and, therefore, it is timely to raise this issue, as my understanding is there have been no visits to Roscommon by IDA Ireland client companies so far this year and there have been just two visits to Ballinasloe.  I met IDA Ireland officials last week and I was highly dissatisfied with the explanations as to why there are so few visits to counties Roscommon and Galway.<\/p> <p>It appears Roscommon and Ballinasloe, in particular, have fallen off the radar when it comes to IDA Ireland promoting the region.  Much more needs to be done to prioritise investment in Roscommon and Ballinasloe.  IDA Ireland officials said clearly to me last week that regional urban centres are performing well and this is positive.  We know Galway city is performing well, as is Parkmore, which is overcapacity.  However, job creation needs to be stimulated in a wider area than this.  A greater balance in job creation must be achieved.  For example, the IDA Ireland business park in Roscommon town has 11 acres of available space.  It is a town with significant potential, and I use the example of Harmac Medical Products, based in IDA Ireland's business park in Castlerea.  It is a client company, which has been there for the past 20 years.  It is an expanding medical device company, which has very much sewn roots in the Castlerea area.  It has a dedicated workforce of approximately 300 people and it is in the process of expanding.  This is a good argument to try to ensure we support investment and job creation in more of our rural towns.  I say this with particular emphasis on Roscommon town and Ballinasloe.<\/p> <p>This is not the first time I have raised this issue with the Minister of State.  I have also raised it with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  I am very clear that much more needs to be done.  More jobs need to be created and delivered in our region.  Opportunities are needed for young people to live, work and enjoy the great quality of life our region offers.  A certain focus needs to be brought on this to ensure we see delivery of jobs, which we do not see at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#C00200","speaker":"1415"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which she has on many occasions.  I visited Ballinasloe early last year to see the town at first hand.  I am aware of the hard work the Senator is doing to try to attract investment to her region.  It is something we are all trying to do for our own regions.<\/p> <p>I stress that the Government is determined to support the growth of high quality and sustainable employment in all regions, including in County Roscommon.  Regional development is, and will remain, a national priority, and sustained efforts are being made to foster job creation and investment all over the country.  IDA Ireland, of course, plays a major role in this.  Every region in Ireland has experienced foreign direct investment, FDI, employment gains in recent years and more than 132,000 people are now employed by 681 IDA Ireland client companies located outside Dublin, with 50% of all new FDI jobs created last year based in regional locations.<\/p> <p>The agency continues to market Roscommon to potential investors.  IDA Ireland works closely with Enterprise Ireland and its indigenous base of companies to enhance clusters, which are important.  It is important that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices, LEOs, work together to ensure they can create employment in the regions.  They work together to participate in site visits and maximise benefits for the county.  From 2015 until 2017, the agency paid almost &euro;920,000 in grants to FDI companies in Roscommon.  These grants are an important means of encouraging companies to invest in Ireland, particularly in regional locations such as Roscommon.<\/p> <p>With regard to site visits, Senator Hopkins is correct that IDA Ireland hosted three site visits to Roscommon in 2017 and 2018.  While there have been no site visits to the county so far in 2019, it is worth remembering that such visits do not reflect investment potential in an area.  Many of the FDI companies in the regions are existing companies, which are solidifying and growing their bases in the regions.  In fact, overall employment trends in County Roscommon are positive.  Nine IDA Ireland-supported companies operate in the county, employing 1,171 people, which is an increase of 3% compared to the previous year.  FDI is increasing.  According to the most recent FDI employment data, between 2012 and the end of 2018, the county experienced a 25% increase in FDI employment.<\/p> <p>The Government recently launched regional action plans to further stimulate job creation and investment in the regions.  In February, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, launched the west regional enterprise plan.  This is focused on six strategic objectives that build on the region's strengths and address vulnerabilities.  These include achieving further development and growth in life sciences, agritech, tourism and the creative sector, as well as strengthening the regional ecosystem with regard to skills availability and enterprise space.  Jobs growth has been strong in all regions, including the west.  As the Senator said, we are awaiting IDA Ireland's results for the west later this morning.  There are 28,400 more people at work in the west today than at the beginning of 2015, when the then Government first launched regional jobs plans, and the unemployment rate has reduced significantly from almost 12.6% to 5.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#C00300","speaker":"1272"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The final statistic cited by the Minister of State is important.  Significant work has been done to reduce unemployment.  As he said, the rate is now at 5.5%, which is positive.  However, I am not satisfied, and I do not have adequate evidence that enough is being done.  I will outline a few examples.  IDA Ireland's business park in Ballinasloe, with which the Minister of State will be familiar, has two good, solid companies in Aptar and SurModics but the difficulty is substantial space is available on the site that is not being utilised.  Voluntary groups are trying to apply for planning permission to build advance facilities.  I am working closely with them to support them but surely IDA Ireland needs to do more to ensure advance facilities are built because they are good templates for attracting companies.  The same example should be followed in Roscommon town.  It is an excellent retail town that has improved significantly in recent years.  It is well connected in terms of road and train infrastructure.<\/p> <p>When we look at the figures for the west, the challenge is that Galway is doing well, and the Monksland site is doing well in County Roscommon but, outside of them, there are major challenges and gaps in what IDA Ireland is doing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Maura Hopkins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2478\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2478&amp;amp;pid=MauraHopkins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am aware that there are other agencies.

Some 98% of enterprises are small and medium-sized that employ over 70% of the workforce.  The statistics for Enterprise Ireland companies show that 765 people are employed in 45 companies in Roscommon.  Again, the trend is moving in the right direction and the figure is up 4% on the figure for the previous year.  Nearly &euro;3 million was paid out to Enterprise Ireland clients in the county between 2015 and 2017.  Foreign direct investment is important, but the indigenous and small business sector is also extremely important in every county, which is why I have placed a big emphasis on same.  As the Senator rightly pointed out - I know that she keeps in close contact with the local enterprise office in Roscommon - LEOs help to create jobs.  For many local authorities LEOs are a very important part of the fabric of their areas because they help to create jobs locally, which is important.  One finds that foreign direct investment companies opt to locate in large urban areas.  One can bring as many representatives of companies as one likes to the regions to show them sites, but in the end the companies will decide where they want to locate.  There are some really good companies such as Advanced Couplings Limited, Alexion Pharma, Colour Communications Europe, Harmac Medicals Limited and Jazz Pharmaceuticals, plus the ones named by the Senator.  Balanced regional development is a priority for the Government.   We were delighted with the figures IDA Ireland announced for last year.  Some 57% of jobs were located outside Dublin.  There was a higher percentage for Enterprise Ireland, at nearly 67%.  Therefore, I am happy with the structure, that it is working and that we are moving in the right direction.  Much of the funding under Project Ireland 2040 will be for regeneration projects in towns and large urban areas.

I am particularly pleased that he is here because he has a great understanding of the issue of rural and one-off housing.  I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House to report on the outcome of the work of the working group established by his Department in reviewing the sustainable rural housing guidelines following the Flemish Decree.  The Minister of State does not need a lecture on the Flemish Decree and I do not intend to give him one.  However, I have been extremely active in dealing with this matter for a number of years since I came into the House.  <\/p><p>I have a letter dated 9 May 2017.  In summary, it outlined that the Minister of the day would set up a committee.  I have a funny feeling that it might have been Deputy Coveney who was in office at the time.  However, it was indicated that the Minister would set up a review group.  Clearly, there is an issue with one-off housing.  The Flemish Decree raises a number of concerns across the European Union about one-off housing but, more importantly, about who can live in such housing or seek to develop properties.  The Law Society of Ireland did some work on the issue.  It identified:<\/p><blockquote>A number of Irish planning authorities restrict the granting of planning permission for housing based on personal characteristics of the applicant such as their connection to a particular locale as a &lsquo;permanent native resident&rsquo; who has lived in the area for a number of years, having employment locally, or &ndash; in Gaeltacht areas &ndash; proficiency in the Irish language.  These restrictions are by their nature discriminatory but are generally justified as a means of preserving the culture or rural character of the area.<\/blockquote> <p>The restrictions are also related to employment prospects.  We know, for instance, that in County Wicklow and the Dublin mountains there are people involved in forestry, horticulture, agriculture, stone masonry and so on.  The people who have engaged with me on the issue include Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, Councillor Maura Healy-Rae and, of course, Independent Councillor Donal Grady in Killarney.  They have raised the matter consistently with me, as have other councillors across the country.  <\/p><p>There seems to be a misunderstanding about what is and is not permissible.  I was sufficiently concerned to raise the issue with the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which I asked to compile a paper on it.  It is dated 12 May 2017.  For the information of the Department, the inquiry reference number is 2017\/600.  I pay tribute to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which is an amazing resource within this organisation.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the paper it presented, the findings of which raise concerns.  How is the review group established in May 2017 progressing?  What conclusions has it reached?  Where are its reports?  There are concerns in counties Galway, Kerry, Clare and Wicklow.  I do not want to predict the outcome, but we need greater clarification on the Flemish Decree and the response of the Government to same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#D00500","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  Our respective local authorities were always high on the agenda when it came to development plans.  It is an important issue for many in rural Ireland.  I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to provide an update on the review of the 2005 planning guidelines on sustainable rural housing issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended.<\/p> <p>Like all statutory planning guidelines issued under section 28, the rural housing guidelines are intended to be applied on a consistent and uniform basis by all planning authorities.  Under the guidelines, planning authorities are required to frame the rural housing planning policies in their development plans in a balanced and measured way.   The aim is to ensure the housing needs of rural communities can be met, while simultaneously taking into account the principles of sustainable development and avoiding excessive urban generated development.  The guidelines further aim to ensure sites being developed for housing in all rural areas are suitable with reference to vehicular access and wastewater disposal and also from landscape and design perspectives.  In addition, they outline a number of criteria to be taken into account in local authority development plans for the purpose of assessing whether planning applications for rural housing are intended to meet a rural generated housing need.  These \"local needs\" criteria relate primarily to planning applicants having familial or occupational ties to the rural area in question.  <\/p> <p>In 2007 the European Commission issued an infringement notice against Ireland on the 2005 guidelines which was specifically related to the &ldquo;local needs&rdquo; criteria having regard to a potential conflict with the freedom of movement principle in the EU treaty.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Andrew Doyle:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> The infringement case was subsequently deferred, pending the outcome of a related European Court of Justice case against Belgium, generally known as the Flemish decree case.  The Flemish decree linked the sale or transfer of property in certain Flemish communes to the condition that there should exist a sufficient connection between the prospective property buyer and the relevant community.  This had the practical effect of precluding non-locals from purchasing property in the Flemish communes in question.  In 2013, the ECJ ruled that the Flemish decree constituted an unjustified restriction on freedom of movement under the EU treaty.  Following the ruling the European Commission re-opened the infringement case against Ireland on rural housing guidelines.<\/p><p>On foot of the ruling and subsequent engagement between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the European Commission, a working group was established in May 2017 to review and recommend changes to the 2005 guidelines.  The working group comprises senior officials from the planning division of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and senior officials from the planning divisions of local authorities nominated by the local government sector.  In making recommendations, the objective of the group will be to ensure that rural housing policies and objectives in county development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the EU treaty.  The working group must take account of the rural housing policy related objectives contained in the national planning framework, NPF, in its deliberations on the review of the 2005 guidelines.  As a general guiding principle, the NPF fully supports the sustainable development of rural areas by seeking to encourage growth and arrest decline in areas that have experienced low population growth or population decline in recent decades.  These are considered to be weaker rural areas, as such.  At the same time, the NPF also highlights the need to manage certain stronger rural areas around cities and towns that are under pressure from urban-generated development to avoid overdevelopment of those areas.  It also requires planning authorities to carry out a housing need demand assessment to correlate and accurately align overall future housing requirements across all types and tenures in rural and urban areas as an evolution of existing housing strategy requirements under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Accordingly, the NPF objectives are aligned with the approach already expected of planning authorities under the current 2005 guidelines.<\/p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government intends to provide further guidance to local authorities later this year to support their housing need demand assessment work as part of the review of their development plans.  The working group has met on five occasions.  Subject to the completion of its ongoing deliberations, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will be in a position to finalise and issue to planning authorities revisions to the 2005 rural housing guidelines.  The aim is to ensure that these revisions strike a balanced and reasonable approach to rural housing in line with the objectives in the national planning framework while also taking account of the ruling in the Flemish decree case.  The revisions to the guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act.  This means planning authorities and, where appropriate, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be required to apply the revised guidelines in the performance of their statutory planning functions specifically in respect of the assessment and determination of planning applications and appeals for rural housing proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#D00600","speaker":"1356","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":32,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

We still have councils telling their elected members that they cannot make certain planning decisions because the question of the Flemish decree has not been officially completed or dealt with and remains an outstanding case in respect to Ireland.

There can be consistent application of the rules but different circumstances arise.  As I said in my opening address, we have places that are weaker rural areas where the population is stagnant or in decline and needs propping up.  In contrast, those who live where I live may be subject to the risk of urban-generated pressure and that can be overwhelming at times.  The county development plan and local area plans in Wicklow have always been seen to be restrictive, but that is because of the general pressure.  Still, genuine local need is being met.<\/p> <p>Ironically, many years ago when we provided rural clusters as a tier in the settlement strategy, the arrangement was deliberately restrictive so that it would be affordable for locals.  The risk was that if we opened it up too much, then no local would be able to afford it.  The rationale was that capital could be generated from other people who might have sold properties in other areas.

The reason I asked the Minister to come in today relates to Na&iacute;onra Bhaile Chruaich Teoranta, which is an Irish-speaking preschool in Ballycroy, County Mayo.  The preschool was established in 2001 by a voluntary group of local parents.  No preschool services were available at that time.  Since then, it has become the heart of the community and has enjoyed great success serving families well throughout the years.  Na&iacute;onra Bhaile Chruaich Teoranta works in partnership with local government to ensure the long-term use of the old national school.  As it happens, it is my old national school so the Minister will forgive me for being extra passionate about this particular project.  It was a derelict school and was then transformed into a vibrant and refurbished preschool and after-school service.  It has ensured a lifeline for the parish and its people.<\/p> <p>The Minister may be aware that Ballycroy covers a large geographical area of 210 sq. km.  Hence, the preschool and after-school service offer a space for all of the children in the parish to connect and play together.  We have two excellent national schools in the parish.  One was recently built and the other was recently refurbished.  Funding for the preschool falls under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This inhibits the sustainability of services because the current funding model system is not equitable.  The Department funds through a set capitation model.  The current system benefits services located where the population is high and, as a consequence, the numbers using preschool facilities are high as well.  Increases in the capitation grant are of course welcome, but this does not address the issues for rural services.  It may serve to make the services with higher numbers better off but it does not serve areas like Ballycroy.<\/p> <p>The rural action plan makes explicit reference to the importance of regenerating these areas and having vibrant services in these areas.  However, early years services cannot access funding through the CL&Aacute;R or RAPID programmes.  That is the key to it.  Something needs to be done.  The position needs to be reviewed so that the Department and CL&Aacute;R can jointly fund rural services such as the na&iacute;onra in Ballycroy.  Such services should be able to make an application on the ground of their rural location.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If that is not done, the future of Na&iacute;onra Bhaile Chruaich will be under threat.  The problem is that its closure would mean there would be no preschool service in the parish.  There has been significant investment in the national park and other facilities in Ballycroy, which is on the Wild Atlantic Way and so on.<\/p><p>I am afraid that this issue will be considered on the basis of a snapshot in time and the conclusion will be reached that there are not enough children to sustain the school or make it viable under the current funding model.  What about next year, the year after and the year after that?  What about people, such as members of my family, who wish to move back to the parish and raise their children there?  There will be no preschool service for them.  These children have the right to a preschool service.  That right is upheld in other parts of the country and that needs to be the case in rural areas.  That is why the funding model must be changed.<\/p><p>I have a submission that I will give to the Minister for her consideration and that of her Department in the context of finding ways to keep these facilities open.  We have had to fight for our post offices, Garda stations and other facilities, but people in rural Ireland are tired of fighting.   We want a little flexibility to address depopulation in rural areas and to do everything we can to bring people back into them so that we can have vibrant communities.  Can the Minister imagine a parish without young or other children?  The heart and soul of the parish would be missing.  It would be like having a garden without flowers.  We need facilities to ensure children continue to live in these areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#E00500","speaker":"1378","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":37,"content":"<p>Assisting families to access high quality and affordable early learning and care, ELC, and school-age childcare, SAC, is a priority for me as Minister.  Government investment in childcare has increased by an unprecedented 117% over the past four budgets, with &euro;575 million allocated in 2019.  This investment has provided for record numbers of children benefitting from my Department's ELC and SAC programmes in 2018 and 2019.  It has also provided for significant increases to the beneficiary payments to childcare providers, including a 7% increase to early childhood care and education, ECCE, providers in 2018, while targeted childcare supports provided under the community childcare subvention scheme and the training and employment childcare scheme were enhanced significantly in September 2017, some by up to 50%.<\/p> <p>I want investment in this area to continue to increase significantly over the coming years.  I am, therefore, delighted that First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to doubling investment over the next ten years.  The national childcare scheme will mark another significant milestone for early learning and care and school-age childcare and create an infrastructure through which the Government can further increase investment in services over this period.<\/p> <p>Na&iacute;onra Bhaile Chruaich is a small service in a remote and sparsely populated region of Mayo, as ably described by the Senator.  I understand that the service has been facing sustainability challenges due to declining registrations and is expecting a further decline in demand in 2019-20.  The current programmes do not differentiate between the geographical locations of services to provide ELC and SAC services to as many children and families as possible in a fair and equitable manner.  However, the First 5 strategy commits to undertake research on the ELC and SAC needs of parents who work atypical hours or live in rural communities, and develop recommendations for further action in this respect.  That will be progressed in 2020.<\/p> <p>In the meantime, I fully recognise the challenges that may be faced by community services, including those such as Na&iacute;onra Bhaile Chruaich, which are situated in rural or isolated locations.  That is why my Department has developed a strong case management system operated by Pobal through which a dedicated team assists services facing challenges.  This assistance may include expert guidance, a review of the financial position of the service and an assessment of its operating and business model.  I understand that the service in question has sought assistance from Pobal case management.  I urge staff to continue engaging with the Pobal case management team, which will be able to provide these supports in partnership with the Mayo county childcare committee.<\/p> <p>In addition to the non-financial supports I outlined, my Department has made a number of financial supports available to community services facing specific challenges to their ongoing sustainability, including a once-off financial support for services in rural and isolated areas that suffer from falling or fluctuating demand.

The INTO and USI had significant support yesterday from Members across the two Houses.  I want to stress some of their requests.  We know, especially for primary school education, that class size is one of the most important mechanisms for ensuring that children get the best education possible.  I work in, and hope eventually to represent, Dublin South Central, an area which has one of the highest proportion of schools in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme in the country.  DEIS has been successful since it was brought in by my Fianna F&aacute;il colleague, former Deputy Mary Hanafin  It is time now to bring in a second round of DEIS because, despite the programme's success, many children in inner city and more disadvantaged communities are still left behind.  We need proper investment in schools, class sizes and appropriate support, leadership and paths for career progression to keep young teachers in the profession.  The teachers make the children and ensure they get the best possible education.<\/p> <p>The representatives of the USI brought forward many issues that we already know about and discuss every day in this House.  The first and foremost is housing.  Where one will live is a significant factor when considering where to go to a third level institution in this country.  The CAO forms allowing students to change their minds are out now and students have ten days to decide what courses they would like to pursue and housing is an issue.  A student who is fortunate enough to live in Dublin can stay at home and have a choice of the excellent colleges in the capital.  However, for a student who lives outside the capital and far from a good third level institution, the issue of where they will live will be the biggest factor in deciding which college to put on their CAO form.  That should not be the case.  Students should be able to decide what course they want to do based on the merits of the course.<\/p> <p>I ask the Government to look at grants and the prospect of reducing fees for third level students.  It is a cliche but the old Irish saying, \"Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;; c&aacute;in an &oacute;ige agus cr&iacute;onnfaidh s&iacute;\" is pertinent and very much applies to education.  It is the best investment we can make in our State.<\/p> <p>I was very impressed by the presentation from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  There is stiff competition for tourism across Europe at the moment.  I commend the local authorities around the country that are putting their best feet forward in Dublin, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and across counties Cork and Kerry.  We have great options available for tourists.  There has been an increase in numbers of tourists to Ireland and we need to keep an eye on it and ensure there is proper investment in tourism.

This is twice as many people as 20 years ago and 2.3 million higher than 2017&rsquo;s figures.  It is deeply worrying that this global figure of refugees is likely to be an underestimate.<\/p> <p>Today the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, issued a strong statement calling again for changes to be made to the International Protection Act 2015 which are in line with my International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill.  The commission stated that it \"has criticised the narrowing of access to family reunification for people granted international protection\" under changes to the legislation made in 2015.  The commission also stated that \"the removal of the right of international protection beneficiaries to apply for family reunification with extended family members under the International Protection Act 2015 and the introduction of a statutory time limit for applications constitutes retrogressive measures\".  <\/p> <p>The International Protection (Family Reunification) (Amendment) Bill, which I introduced in July 2017, passed all Stages in the Seanad on 7 March 2018.

This man, in his ninth decade, celebrated a very important anniversary that may resonate with the Leader.  Seventy years ago Belfast priest Fr. Des Wilson was ordained and he has spent the 70 years of his ministry in the service of his faith in the diverse community of Belfast and beyond.  Fr. Des, as he is affectionately known, is a sage, a man of great wisdom, a scholar, a fluent Irish speaker, a published writer and regular columnist.  He is a theologian with a keen sense of the gospel of hope and liberation for the oppressed, powerless and those on the margins of life.  With a small number of other priests he has spent his life opening the church and its teachings to the people in the pews, so much so that he decided to live, teach and struggle among them.<\/p> <p>He has always acknowledged, celebrated, empowered and lifted the role and place of women in our society, including the late Ms Noelle Ryan, a lifelong friend and confidante.  He did all this because he knew the depth of people's faith and the deep desire they have to be treated with dignity, respect and justice.  For Fr. Des, the church and its people are indivisible, one and the same.  He is a crusader for justice with a compassionate and consummate commitment to help those in need.  In the most difficult days of conflict, he was a beacon of reason, hope and peace for those people hurt by the conflict.<\/p> <p>Fr. Des has a great sense of humour.  He is a raconteur and a joy to be with for a cup of tea around his famous and much sought-after kitchen table in his equally famous community house in Springhill, where he has educated generations of people from Springhill, Ballymurphy and beyond.  I studied for my maths GCSE there as I needed a bit of extra help at the time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#H00400","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I do not think so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#H00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>He is a priest for all the people and for all seasons.

As a Donegal man, I have heard of far too many of our fishermen losing their lives.  We were delighted in 2016 when it was announced by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that it would fund a &euro;1.5 million sea safety and survival training centre at the National Fisheries College at Greencastle.  The centre would have a deep 15 m pool where weather conditions found at sea could be simulated.  The only other pool of this kind on the island is in Cork, so there would be one at the top of the island in Greencastle on the Inishowen Peninsula and one at the bottom in Cork.  Fishermen and others involved in life-saving would be trained, including Coast Guard and Royal National Lifeboat Institution personnel.  It could train people from Mayo up the coast to the top of Donegal, as well as people from the Six Counties, I am sure.<\/p> <p>We learned in recent days that the announcement made just a week before the general election in 2016 has been rowed back.

I have spoken to people in the college and the community, as well as fishermen, and people are very angry about this.  There is a real sense of betrayal.

He is renowned as a champion of the people, particularly in the context of education.  Fr. Paddy McCafferty spoke at his mass yesterday.  We thank him for his work.  His 70 years in the priesthood is, by any stretch of the imagination, a wonderful testimony to a life well lived.  We wish him <i>ad multos annos<\/i>.<\/p><p><i><\/i>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of a number of briefings held yesterday, one of which was hosted by the INTO.  We all value our education system.  We applaud the quality of our teachers and school communities.  I also attended the briefing in the museum yesterday by the INTO.  As the Senator will be aware, last year we continued to pursue the Action Plan for Education with an budget of &euro;10.763 billion, an increase of 6.7%.  The request made by the INTO yesterday was reasonable.  Last year's budget provided one day for teaching principals for administration.  The Government has also created more than 1,300 new posts, including 950 new SNA posts and 372 new teaching posts.  The school capitation grant also increased by 5% in the budget.  Under Project Ireland 2040, there will be an &euro;11.9 billion capital investment in education.  Between 2011 and 2016, at a time the country had little or no money, the Fine Gael-led Government made a significant commitment to improve the capital spend in the built environment in our education communities.  Notwithstanding the positivity, there are challenges at third level, particularly with regard to housing.  I am sure the Senator will join me in welcoming increases in the availability of student accommodation.  That said, challenges remain.  The Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, raised numerous concerns yesterday.  <\/p><p>Our tourism figures continue to increase.  There was a 6% increase in the number of overseas visitors between January and March of this year, albeit with a number of caveats.  The spend is down by 4%, with the exception of North America.

We all know of businesses and properties that have been damaged and of people who have been interfered with and intimidated.  This cannot continue.  A more robust approach must be taken to anti-social behaviour, whether through increasing the use of anti-social behaviour orders, ASBOs, or instituting no-go zones in the context of zero tolerance, although I do not like using that phrase.

On this occasion, there is also a considerable volume of amendments to be discussed, but this time related to personal injuries matters.  I propose to take the approach taken on the last occasion, that is, explaining the purpose behind the various amendments I am proposing and associated related amendments in a way which I hope will facilitate an informed and structured debate on what is a very important matter both for this House and society at large.<\/p><p>By way of background, Senators will be aware that the proposal to assign a role to the Judicial Council in compiling guidelines on appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury first arose in July 2018 when the second and final report of the Personal Injuries Commission was published.  The Government took the view that there was considerable merit in the recommendation, not least because its implementation, in promoting consistency in the level of damages awarded by the courts, should have a calming effect on the insurance market in general.<\/p><p>The first set of amendments I am proposing &ndash; amendments Nos. 1, 5, 6, 14, 15 and 20 &ndash; will effect a range of technical changes to the Bill to accommodate the personal injuries guidelines committee in its structure.  Consequent on the establishment of the committee, it is necessary to have a definition of personal injury in the Bill.  Amendment No. 6 deals with this issue.  Also, because of the terminology being used, a small change is needed in the language used in section 17 which deals with the role of the judicial studies committee.  Amendment No. 20<b><\/b>is relevant in that regard. <\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendments Nos. 2, 4, 21, 39, 42 and 43 are connected in various ways with the functions the new committee will have.  A key amendment is amendment No. 21.  Following the model related to both the sentencing information and guidelines committee and the judicial conduct committee, provision is made for the committee to prepare draft personal injuries guidelines and submit them for review by the board of the Judicial Council.  The amendment specifies that the first draft of the guidelines must be submitted to the board no later than 12 months after the establishment of the committee.  The committee will be required to review the guidelines on a three year basis.  If the review indicates that amendments are required, the committee will be obliged to prepare a draft of such amendments for submission to the board.<\/p><p>To assist it in carrying out its functions, the committee will have broad powers to obtain any information it might need.  It may also consult appropriate persons and bodies, including the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, and conduct research into the level of damages awarded by the courts in the State and elsewhere.<\/p><p>Under the amendment, the committee is also mandated to prepare material for inclusion in the annual report of the Judicial Council on its activities.<\/p><p>The amendment is linked with amendment No. 42 which seeks to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 so as to remove from the board the responsibility it currently has for preparing the book of quantum and revising it at least once every three years.<\/p><p><b><\/b>Amendments Nos. 4 and 39 are central to the reforms I am proposing.  Specifically, amendment No. 39 provides that the guidelines are to contain general guidelines on the level of damages that may be awarded or assessed for personal injuries.  They may also offer guidance on matters such as the range of damages to be considered for a particular injury or the impact multiple injuries may have on the level of damages.  <\/p><p>The amendment specifies various factors which are to be taken into account by the committee in preparing drafts of such guidelines.  One such factor relates not just to the level of damages awarded by the courts in the State but also to the damages awarded by courts in places outside the State.  <\/p><p>Much attention has been focused on the finding made in the second and final report of the Personal Injuries Commission that soft tissue injury claim costs in this jurisdiction are a multiple or over four times those which prevail in England and Wales.  This element of the amendment will provide the committee with the tools it needs to take relevant international comparative costs into account when drawing up draft guidelines.<\/p><p>Another important factor concerns the principles set down by the courts in this jurisdiction.  We have become very familiar with the idea that modest injuries should attract moderate damages.  At the heart of this idea is an appreciation that damages for pain and suffering must be reasonable, having regard to the injuries sustained, and must be proportionate within the scheme of awards made to individuals for injuries which are of significantly greater or lesser import.  In addition, the courts have recognised that damages should be objectively reasonable in the light of the common good and social conditions.  I am confident that guidelines which reflect these principles will inevitably bring about a much needed recalibration of the existing book of quantum.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael D'Arcy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2208\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=20\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A final factor to which I will briefly allude concerns the need to have regard to guidelines relating to the classification of personal injuries.  While not specifically referenced, this would allow the committee to take account of the highly reputable whiplash associated disorder scale, which was developed by the Quebec task force and helps to determine the type and extent of medical care likely to be needed to treat an injury effectively and to resolve accompanying pain and discomfort.<\/p><p>The final element in this set of amendments is contained in amendment No. 43, which relates to section 22 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  One element of the amendment, which is purely technical, replaces references to the book of quantum, to which the courts shall have regard, with references to the personal injuries guidelines.  The other element of the amendment, which is more significant, requires a court which departs from the guidelines to state the reasons for such departure in giving its decision.  This amendment will allow for greater assessment of the extent to which the guidelines are being followed and will also be of assistance to the appellate courts in determining whether the reasons given for the departure are justified.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 7 to 13, inclusive, relate to the role of the council and the board of the council in the draft personal injuries guidelines.  To ensure consistency with other provisions in the Bill, these amendments mirror the arrangements envisaged for the judicial conduct committee and the sentencing guidelines and information committee.  As a result of these amendments, it will be a clear function of the council to promote among judges an understanding of the principles governing the assessment of damages for personal injuries.  Express clarification is also provided that the council can enter into contracts or engage consultants for the purposes of enabling the various committees to carry out their functions.  This is especially important in the case of the personal injuries guidelines committee.<\/p><p>Amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, are concerned with issues around membership of the committee and the procedures of the committee.  Amendment No. 22 provides that the committee will consist of seven judges, with at least one judge drawn from each of the jurisdictions.  Amendment No. 23 specifies that the standard membership term for the committee shall be four years, to be renewable once.  The filling of casual vacancies is dealt with in amendment No. 24.  Matters such as the procedures for meetings, the first of which is to be held not later than one month after the date of the committee's establishment, and the quorum for meetings, which is set at three, are addressed in amendment No. 25.  I hope Senators will agree that the amendments I have outlined are comprehensive in nature.  I look forward to their comments on them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#K00700","speaker":"1364","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":92,"content":"<p>I will not prolong the agony of the House.

It is a matter for the Judiciary, rather than lay members, to do that.  We have made a determination in this regard.  The model we are proposing aligns with the model which operates in Wales, England and Northern Ireland.  As will be the case here, the Sentencing Council for England and Wales has a broad membership which includes academics with appropriate expertise, whereas the Judicial College for England and Wales, which draws up personal injuries guidelines, is embedded firmly within the UK judiciary.  We are in line with other jurisdictions.  It does not seem that there is an obvious pool of disinterested parties who could be drawn on to participate in the function of the committee.

We need people with expertise, diversity and an understanding of the impact of sentencing on the lives of people, especially when there is unconscious bias.  We understand direct bias in terms of race and gender, but unconscious bias can go much further than that.  We will come to my amendment later in this debate.  This is a concrete example of the issue I am seeking to address.  It is proposed to fill a room with people who come from a certain social, cultural and economic background.

It is an important Bill.  I have already spoken on behalf of the Labour Party on Second and Committee Stages when I welcomed the legislation and the amendments.<\/p> <p>I seek a response from the Minister of State on a specific issue.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has raised aspects of it.  It relates to this group of amendments about the personal injuries guidelines committee.  Under amendment No. 22, the committee will comprise seven judges who will be nominated by the Chief Justice.  Is there any provision - I do not see it in the amendments - for the committee to consult external persons or experts?  I ask because I am contrasting the committee with the sentencing guidelines and information committee, which I very much welcome.  This is set out in section 19 which specifically refers to lay members, in addition to judicial members.  Section 20 provides that it would be desirable for the lay members to possess knowledge of and experience in a number of areas, including the administration of justice, sentencing policy, the use of statistics and the rehabilitation of offenders, and that the Public Appointments Service shall have regard to this desirability.  That is important.<\/p> <p>What Senator Ruane said about diversity of committee membership and an unconscious bias is important.  The Senator has tabled specific amendments to deal with this issue.

From my work on sentencing practice over a number of years and my research into the issue, I realise the importance of having a structure for the exercise of judicial discretion in sentencing.  I hope the structured framework will have regard to recommendations such as those of the Oireachtas justice committee.  Some years ago, other members of the committee, including Senator Conway, and I made various recommendations which implied that imprisonment should be a sanction of last resort.  We referred to the need for greater consistency in sentencing and less reliance on short sentences, which achieve so little in terms of rehabilitation.  Unfortunately, our system has been too dependent on them for too long for minor, non-violent offences.  We recommended a move towards community-based sanctions instead.  I am hopeful we will see really positive and progressive developments in sentencing as a result of this legislation, but I am interested in contrasting the sentencing guidelines and information committee's structure with that of the personal injuries guidelines committee.  I welcome the latter, but I just want to know whether there will be a facility to consult experts.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#M00200","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I apologise if I did not bring to the Senator's attention subsection (7) of the proposed new section 18.

Much of what I am talking about concerns the lower levels of awards, or lower levels of damages, which are out of kilter by comparison with those made in our nearest neighbours, Wales and England.

The Personal Injuries Assessment Board also did work on the issue and concluded that awards made here were a little less than five times higher.  There is enough evidence at this stage and enough scope within the Bill for the seven judges not only to consider the matter but also to authorise people, on their behalf, to obtain and analyse the information and ensure it will be scrutinised correctly in order that they will be properly informed.

The original arrangements envisaged that the committees then in contemplation would be established by the Judicial Council at its first meeting and, in the case of the judicial conduct committee, that its first meeting would be held not later than three months after the first meeting of the council.  Within 12 months of its establishment, it would have to prepare and submit to the board of the council draft guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics.  Given the number of committees now falling within the ambit of the council, it seemed prudent to look again at the arrangements for their establishment with a view to seeing if some phasing would be possible to alleviate some of the pressures that might otherwise arise if they were all required to begin their work within the same short timeframe.<\/p> <p>Under the proposed amendments, provision is made whereby, at its first meeting, the council will specify a date upon which the individual committees will be established.

The proposed phasing will ensure that, in the case of committees where lay membership is an issue, there will be adequate time to ensure that the necessary people are in place to facilitate their establishment.  In the case of the judicial conduct committee, it is also essential that there be sufficient time to ensure that a registrar is in place so that the complaints regime can run smoothly from the outset.<\/p> <p>There are also practical issues relating to the selection of judges for the various committees, the need to have a physical space where meetings can take place and the need to have adequate resources available to the committees in order that they can carry out their work in an effective way from their very first meeting.

I have raised this point on previous Stages of the Bill.  Our purpose in drafting amendment No. 17 was to ensure a specific role for the judicial studies committee in providing judges with guidance on the conduct of criminal trials.  Our amendment suggests the insertion of a provision into section 17 to change it somewhat.  While section 17(3) already enables the judicial studies committee to prepare and distribute relevant materials to judges, we believe this should specifically include materials relevant to the exercise by judges of their functions in conducting criminal trials with a jury, including but not limited to the functions of trial management, jury management and directing the jury.  We have been specific because of concerns that have arisen recently around comments made by judges, as well as judges controlling prejudicial comments made to jury by counsel.  I have in mind specifically sex offence trials where issues have been raised in the public domain about aspects relating to the complainant's clothing in a sex offence trial.  The recent controversies have illustrated the need for guidance to be provided to judges in how to conduct criminal trials where such prejudicial comment is made.  Having been a practitioner I am conscious of the way so many appeals have come forward through the criminal courts relating to aspects of what a judge has said in summing up to a jury or in seeking to sum up evidence or give the jury instruction on procedure and criminal law.<\/p><p>It would be helpful to prescribe that the judicial studies committee should give guidance of this specific nature to those conducting criminal trials.  I am conscious that the Government amendment, amendment No. 18, seeks to do something similar by inserting a line referring to the conduct of trials by jury in criminal proceedings.  If either of the amendments come through I will not push mine to a vote.  The Government amendment seeks to do something similar.<\/p><p>Senator Ruane's amendment seeks to address something different, that is to say, the issue of unconscious bias, although that is what I am trying to get at in my amendment as well.  I hope that would be got at through the guidance provided by the judicial studies committee to judges in the conduct of criminal trials more generally.<\/p><p>I know there are judges' bench books in the Four Courts.  Yet, despite their central importance they are private and unregulated documents.  The overall tenor of this legislation is to seek to provide a structure to judges within which they may exercise discretion without being unduly prescriptive and without fettering judges in their discretion.<\/p><p>That is also an important point to make and it is similar to the point I have already made in respect of the sentencing guidelines.  There has been considerable criticism over the years of the fact that our sentencing practice is largely reliant on an instinctive synthesis, as the Law Reform Commission has said.  Over many years Tom O'Malley and other experts have called for a structure to be provided to judges within which they may exercise discretion.  The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has recommended a particular approach to sentencing that would minimise the use of short sentences of imprisonment for minor non-violent offences and instead place greater reliance on community-based sanction.  We are moving in that direction anyway with greater emphasis on rehabilitation - I very much welcome that - and this Bill is an important part of that process.  Just as we provide guidance to judges in the exercise of sentencing discretion so too should we specifically provide a structure and framework within which judges conduct criminal trials, direct the jury and exercise control and management of the trial process, including control over comments made in the course of a trial by counsel or others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#N04400","speaker":"1402","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":148,"content":"<p>I should have said that amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#O00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I was waiting for you to say that, Acting Chairman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#O00300","speaker":"1402"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":150,"content":"<p>You dealt with all three amendments anyway, but we can agree that they may be discussed together by agreement.

I welcome the Bill and the changes that are being made to it in the Seanad.  The provisions on sentencing guidelines, education and training and the introduction of disciplinary procedures are most welcome.<\/p> <p>The Bill is a welcome attempt by Government to modernise and improve the Judiciary and how it operates.  It allows for the standardisation of experiences in order that there will be some form of continuity between courts and judges for people with similar legal cases and so that judges will receive standardised education and training sessions.  Over time, this will start to build up further institutional continuity in sentencing.<\/p> <p>While we want judges to have discretion in how they decide cases, we also want to ensure that the Irish legal system handles near-identical cases with some degree of similarity and that individual judges and courts do not hand out vastly different sentences.  We are lucky to have high public confidence in our Judiciary and that needs to be maintained.  However, the fact is that judges are human too.  They may be charged with interpreting our laws and the Constitution but they are normal people and the fact is that people are a product of their environment, background and how they were brought up.  Their experiences all come together to shape their perspectives on the law, life, society and other people too.  When judges make judgments on a case or hand down a sentence they consciously use their years of experience of legal scholarship.  However, unconscious factors will also come into play.  It will not be intentional but arises from their unique life experiences.  Every judge will see the same case in a slightly different way.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 19 seeks to ensure that judges would be regularly educated and trained on the impact of unconscious bias in their decisions and sentencing so that they know to be aware of it and take it into account.  This is not to say that judges are biased in any way.  It simply seeks to recognise the reality that no judge is the same.<\/p> <p>As we progress a Bill that is designed to bring continuity of experience to our judicial system, this is a piece of the puzzle.  Legal training and the continued development of our Judiciary must expand to ensure we continuously address the impact of unconscious bias on stereotyping and sentencing.  We must look into the fact that it manifests itself in how legal proceedings can unfold.<\/p> <p>I spent a good deal of time in and out of courts during the past 20 years as someone in the court as a young offender and later as someone who supported many people in addiction and homelessness in the court system.  I have sat, witnessed and watched how different judges use different language and impose different sentences.  I have seen different opportunities and chances, especially for people in addiction.  I have said this before in the House.  When one of the participants on our addiction programmes was before the court in Kilmainham, we used to hope for the female judge - I think her name was Catherine.  I think she has passed away now but we hoped she would be in position because she had a unique understanding of addiction and the implications of a person's environment.  We took the view that she was fair in her assessment of the individual before her because she had training or personal experience of someone living in addiction.  That had a major and positive impact on the people who were before her within the court system.<\/p> <p>As humans, we make quick assessments and we have preconceived ideas.  It happens so quickly and it is not something we do consciously.  We need to continuously challenge that to create a far fairer system.  In that way, people from minority backgrounds might take the view that they are stereotyped less and that court proceedings are more fair and equal.  It would be positive for judges to be able to constantly challenge unconscious bias and become aware of it within themselves.  I hope the Minister of State can support the amendment.<\/p> <p>I support the Government and Labour Party amendments in the section on jury conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#O00500","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":152,"content":"<p>In its current form, section 17(3)(c) specifies that the judicial studies committee may provide education and training on matters relevant to the exercise by judges of their functions.

During our Committee Stage debate, Senator Bacik spoke about using the opportunity provided by section 17 to reference the need to have training for judges who are conducting criminal trials with a jury.

I believe that this will be more than adequate to address the various issues that may arise in jury trials, such as trial management, jury management, directing the jury, etc.  These were matters adverted to by Senator Bacik on Committee Stage and they are, of course, also itemised in the amendment which she has tabled.  I have chosen to deal with this matter the training context set out in section 17(3)(c).  I believe that this is the appropriate location for the text I am proposing.  It does not, of course, preclude the distribution of relevant materials on this topic under section 17(3)(a).  I believe, however, that it is better that that subsection continues to have a general import.  I hope Senator Bacik can accept that a broad provision of the kind I am proposing is sufficient to achieve the objective we both share.  I hope she will not press her amendment in these circumstances.  <\/p><p>I also note amendment No. 19 in the names of Senators Ruane, Higgins and Kelleher dealing with unconscious bias.  I will comment briefly.  While I understand Senators' concern and why this amendment is being put forward, I am reluctant to include a provision of this kind in the Bill.  As a consequence, I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  I put that on the record because the fact that a matter is not specified in the indicative list provided does not mean that training regarding that matter is precluded.  Matters set out in the subsection are by way of example.  I anticipate that what the Senators are asking to be included is already included in the Bill.  I do not believe it is appropriate to be putting specific areas into the Bill.  The context of the amendment goes more to behavioural characteristics linked to temperament and attitude.  We can all agree that it is important to recognise the reality of unconscious bias.  I am very reluctant, however, to single out the Judiciary as being the only profession where specific training is needed on this issue.  It is also the case that while training is not specifically itemised it is not precluded.

It was certainly an omission from section 17(3) to not have reference in that provision to criminal trials specifically and to the conduct of trials by jury.  I am glad that is now there.  I will not be pressing my amendment because I accept that what I had hoped would be covered is now covered, albeit not as specifically set out in my amendment.  I do, however, think that this provision meets the concern I had.  This is clearly an enabling provision, as was mine.  We should be cognisant of the fact that in England, the judicial college drew up the English Crown Court compendium under roughly similar statutory enabling powers.  This sort of enabling power has been used elsewhere to provide the type of guidance I am seeking.  It also serves to meet the concerns many people have about judicial control of criminal trials where prejudicial comments are made.<\/p><p>I also listened carefully to the comments of the Minister of State regarding Senator Ruane's amendment.  She will respond herself on that.  It is important, however, that within section 17 the judicial studies committee would be providing training and guidance to<b><\/b>judges in respect of unconscious bias.  Judges should be informed about the way in which gendered stereotypes, for example, can impact upon the conduct of sex offence trials.  I use that again as a specific example.

It is the only fair place for me to do this.  Regarding other professions, I have been working, with many others, on the idea of doctors understanding the social context in which they work.  I have done much work on this issue with the medical profession and it is usually open to assessing how medicine looks a little different in the different communities that people come from.  I have also addressed this issue in respect of the teaching profession.  I am definitively not, therefore, singling out the Judiciary.  This is just an acknowledgement that human beings have preconceived ideas.  We must remember that in this case, the Judiciary will possibly be imposing sentences.  The impact of unconscious bias in this sphere can determine the rest of someone's life.  It is important, therefore, that we address this issue and to do that in legislation.  I am still trying to figure out whether I will be pressing the amendment.  I have about two minutes to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#P00600","speaker":"1404"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":158,"content":"<p>The Senator's raising of this issue here reflects, certainly to my mind, that this should be considered in respect of the analysis regarding the studies.

This could take the form of inviting submissions and observations from the public and NGOs working in criminal justice reform.<\/p> <p>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I have drawn from the provisions of the UK's Coroners and Justice Act 2009 which gave the sentencing council for England and Wales a massive public engagement role which has been praised by stakeholders for giving real public ownership of, and confidence in, the management of sentencing policy.  This council provides online submission forms, organises community round-table meetings, and engages with judges, magistrates, victims and witnesses.  This is all really welcome and turns the drafting process into a collaborative experience, from which we could really benefit.

This review and its conclusions would then be delivered to both Houses of the Oireachtas in a report.  My point in calling for this review is that as we are now looking to a judicial system that will be guided by sentencing guidelines to ensure consistency in sentencing.  As the Minister of State will be aware, most countries in which these kinds of set sentencing polices exist are states that do not have such guidelines.  Now that such guidelines will shortly be introduced, a review of these provisions seems timely. <\/p><p>When the Oireachtas sets out mandatory, minimum and presumptive sentencing in law it removes the opportunity for judicial discretion and for judges to issue sentences which are sensitive to the details of an individual&rsquo;s case and circumstances.  They are a blunt tool that could do with review and reform in light of the work on sentencing that will be undertaken by the new sentencing guidelines and information committee.  The review would take place over two years with a further 12 months given for the drafting of the report and its conclusions.  I know this is an issue on which the Minister is keen to make progress but if such a review is given a legislative mandate it would continue even if there was an election or Cabinet reshuffle, which looks likely to happen in the next 12 months.

This is specifically contemplated by section 17 of the Interpretation Act 2005.  In this instance, I have taken the view that there is merit in having a recognised person who can work with the Judiciary to identify the supports needed if the council is to carry out its functions from the date of its establishment.  That person can also work in the background, carrying out the many routine administrative tasks which will be necessary in the time leading up to the establishment of the council and between its establishment and the appointment of a secretary by the board.  The approach taken will allow the Chief Justice to appoint a member of the staff of the Courts Service to act as interim secretary pending the appointment of a secretary by the board of the council, as is provided for in section 26.  The post is interim secretary and will cease once the formal appointment is made.  This touches on a matter that I raised earlier concerning the establishment of structures.

For reasons that I need not dwell upon, the Bill which emerged from Committee Stage contained two provisions relating to the publication in the annual report of the name of a judge to whom a reprimand is issued following the conclusion of the complaints process.  The amendment I had proposed is contained in what is now subsection (7) and this is the provision which I am the proposing should remain in the Bill.<\/p><p>Under that provision, the default position is that both the name of the judge and the reprimand issued shall be published.  However, there is a saver where it is considered that to safeguard the administration of justice, such publication should not occur.  Subsection (4)(i) will, however, ensure that there is information about the number of cases where a reprimand was issued, but the information about it is not made public.<\/p><p>I have been informed that there are good legal reasons which underpin the provision which the Minister for Justice and Equality originally proposed and these are grounded in the unique independent function of judges in the administration of justice in public under Article 34 of the Constitution.  For example, it is important that regard is had to the ongoing functions of a sitting judge and, in certain circumstances, there might be a risk that litigants could use the fact of the published reprimand to seek judicial review of a judge&rsquo;s decisions.  There may also be instances of reprimands where the judicial misconduct was connected with the health of a judge and where publication might be inappropriate.<\/p><p>I repeat however that, as the amendment is structured, the default position is that there is a requirement to include both the name of the judge and the reprimand issued in the annual report.

While I respect that where an accusation has been made and a judge has not been reprimanded for misconduct, that anonymity ought to be protected, that is not the wording nor is it an issue that exists within the current Bill.  Where it is the case that a judge has been reprimanded and the threshold for such as fine has been adequately met by the functions of the council, then it is vital that this be included in any annual report for the important perception of transparency and accountability which is core to the spirit of the Bill.  While I concede that I do not have the legal experience or capacity of other colleagues across the House, and while I do not want to get into hypothetical examples, there are examples where I believe this could become an issue if that information were not to be forthcoming and was not brought before the public in a way that was appropriate, respectful, transparent and in the public interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#T00200","speaker":"1413"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I do not think that we can have a blanket provision which mandates the disclosure of a judge in all circumstances.

In England and Wales, the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor have discretion not to publish a disciplinary statement where a formal disciplinary sanction has been imposed, based on the individual circumstances of a case.  In New Zealand, where a complaint is not such as would warrant consideration as to removal from office, it is referred to the head of bench who is in charge of the court where the judge complained of sits.  Any subsequent consideration of the complaint takes place on a confidential basis.  In Canada, the only decisions published are those of an inquiry committee and some of the cases before that committee would relate to investigations which may result in the removal of the judge from office.<\/p><p>This is not an issue of transparency.

I described the insurance section as a small corner of the Bill, which it is, but we cannot ignore the importance of that corner for businesses throughout the country.  I thank the Seanad for its speed and flexibility on Committee and Report Stages.  There are a few areas I want to touch upon but I do not have the time to highlight the good work done on this crucial aspect of the Bill.  We have to get this through the D&aacute;il before the summer recess so the Judiciary can form the judicial council and the committee to deal with personal injury damages and move on to the next stage.  A lot of work has been done that has gone completely without comment.  Senator Reilly has highlighted the fact that if a judge moves beyond the guidelines for something he or she has always requested, because it is now in legislation, there will have to be an explanation given to the court explaining the who, what, when, where and how it has been arrived at.  This is very important.<\/p> <p>On many occasions, people have stood up and said there has not been a Garda insurance fraud section, but that is incorrect.  We considered the establishment of an industry-funded structure within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau.  The Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, who is the man with knowledge and policing skill sets that I do not have, has decided to establish a divisional structure.  On every occasion that we hear somebody state we are not going to have a Garda insurance fraud section, it is not correct.  We will, but it will be on a divisional basis.  It will be in every county, quarter and area of the country, which is very important.<\/p> <p>A number of other things have been done.  We had last year's Insurance (Amendment) Act, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019, the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 and this Bill.  Deputy Michael McGrath has a Bill as does Deputy Pearse Doherty that we are hoping to improve.  This Bill, of course, is crucial.  One of the aspects added to the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act last year was in sections 8 and 14 with regard to CCTV footage.  Under data protection rules, if somebody does not state within a month, in line with the data protection period, that there is a potential case and that he or she is making a claim, so that any CCTV footage or video footage can be retained for a full and proper defence, at that point the court will make an inference for or against.  This is a crucial aspect of legislation that has also been changed.  On every occasion somebody is being political about insurance and stating we are doing nothing, they are aiding and abetting insurance fraud and exaggeration because we are doing a lot.  The message must get out that we are doing a lot and we have done a lot.  I thank Senators on this matter.  I thank their speed and efficiency.  I hope and anticipate the Judiciary will do its work a lot sooner than the periods set out in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019062000002#V00900","speaker":"1364"},{"type":"speech","time":1561023000,"counter":249,"content":"<p>I congratulate the Minister of State on the Bill and on all of the hard work he has done quietly and assiduously over the past year and before.

I understand that in essence this is what it is but it will be in every division, so local knowledge will apply and local action can be taken, sometimes in an informal way.  Sometimes, when people realise garda&iacute; are looking at them, they can have a change of heart very quickly.<\/p> <p>I want to praise in particular the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  Peter Boland and his group have done us a great service.  I was very much struck on Committee Stage by the fact that, unlike so many other groups, not alone did it come in and explain the problems but it suggested a suite of solutions.  In fairness, the Minister of State has taken many of them on board in one form or another, and that is democracy in action.  It is about listening to those on the front line suffering the brunt of this in terms of insurance hikes.<\/p> <p>There are many aspects to the issue, as the Minister of State pointed out, and the Bill attacks only some of them.  A perjury Bill will come to the House, which the Government will support.  As the Minister of State said, a loud message needs to leave the House to those who would defraud people by grossly exaggerating, making false claims, or setting up accidents for the purpose of making a claim that there will be consequences, because there have not been to date.  People think that if they try it on today and are found out, they can try again next month.  This will no longer pertain and this message is very important.<\/p> <p>The CCTV provisions are also very important.  They send a loud message to people that this will impact on them.  I believe this was used as a ruse by certain people who waited until the last minute when a lot of the evidence was gone and then made their claim.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for doing all he has done to bring this together.  I also want to mention the great work done by the Garda and I support it.  We want to be in a position to support it.<\/p> <p>With regard to the Judiciary, this is not remotely a witch hunt but an effort to help it improve its performance and have, as do all groups, an element of continuing professional development that allows it to oversee what is happening and help those who might be a little out of line for a host of reasons, which can be done in a friendly and supportive fashion.  It takes a long time to become a judge and we do not want to lose people from the Judiciary.  We want to support them.

Even today, we see the cost of VHI insurance increasing.<\/p> <p>I am a little concerned about a couple of issues.  The Minister of State has said that he will push the timeframe for this as hard as possible.  The legislation outlines periods of time within which reports must be done.  If they can be done faster, that will be all the better.  We do not want to wait for guidelines so that in two years we are still paying high premiums as a result of the awards being made in court.  I am concerned that if the committee recommends leaving awards as they are at present, which is way in excess of what they are throughout Europe and the UK, we will then be looking at capping awards.

They were designed to ensure litigants behaved with utmost good faith in this kind of litigation and they provided penalties, such as loss of the entire claim where any part of it was exaggerated deliberately.  Unfortunately, some members of the Judiciary thought this was draconian but there is nothing draconian in asking people to behave in good faith when making a claim of this kind.  There must be consequences for behaving other than in good faith as a plaintiff.
