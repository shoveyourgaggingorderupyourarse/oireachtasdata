It does not just affect the OPW but I am specifically concerned with reports I have heard about worker morale in the OPW.  These contracts continue to be used despite the fact that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has acknowledged that it is an issue.  SIPTU has repeatedly raised its concerns at the national joint industrial council for State employees about the use of non-established grades.  Skilled guides are being denied access to opportunities and the current contract system limits their access to lifetime personal and financial improvements.<\/p> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the OPW are fully aware that employees have attended interviews and achieved competitive markings at those interviews but are then denied panel placement purely on the basis of their non-established status.  It is not good enough for the Department to hide behind the archaic Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 because it is within the gift of the Minister as a legislator to fix the legal basis and is also within the Department's gift to engage constructively with the trade unions and workers they represent to get this resolved.  SIPTU has requested that the matter be referred to the WRC.  My understanding is that the Department requested a two-month delay to that process in May 2021 yet it continued to advertise and recruit more guides on non-established contracts as recently as September 2021.  <\/p> <p>The inability to access opportunities and the failure of the OPW to provide upskilling while simultaneously refusing to remunerate those who choose to upskill themselves are having a significant impact on the morale of those working in the OPW.  One employee with whom I spoke told me of the hostile environment in which they currently work while another spoke of how, despite their contract stating that their place of work was in one site, they are now being instructed to make a daily 80-km round trip to another site with no financial compensation - something we all understand would be very difficult but which is simply impossible now given the current cost of living crisis.<\/p> <p>The failure to properly recognise the skills of these workers and to offer lifelong progression in their careers is also leading to employee attrition.  Perhaps this is the aim because according to other reports coming out of the OPW, senior OPW figures have told guides that they would love to replace them with machines.  Perhaps this is because machines would then free up even more money to carry out some of the vanity projects that have been undertaken, including ones that have flouted laws such as those requiring a legally mandated bat disturbance licence at Emo Court.  <\/p> <p>Why is the OPW continuing to advertise and hire people under non-established employee contracts despite the Department acknowledging that there are issues with these contracts?  Why are guides being relocated against their wishes to sites more than 40 km from their contracted place of work and why are successful interviewees being prevented from taking up posts in other public service jobs?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#B00200","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan.  The OPW employs approximately 2,500 staff across a wide range of craft, technical, administrative and management disciplines, and all OPW staff have essential roles to play that bring great value to those availing of OPW services across a number of work programmes.  The OPW manages in excess of 2,400 properties on behalf of the State through the estate management programme, which includes some of Ireland's most significant heritage properties, monuments, gardens and arboretums.<\/p> <p>Under its flood risk management brief, the OPW continues to co-ordinate Ireland's whole-of-government approach to managing Ireland's flood risk to reduce to the greatest extent possible the impact of flooding on families and businesses in communities known to be at risk from flooding.  This work is largely carried out by State industrial employees and makes a significant contribution to the health, enjoyment and well-being of the public, particularly in recent times.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, pays tribute to these staff, who maintained a full service for client Departments and the general public during the pandemic.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Parks and heritage sites provided much-needed relief from the restrictions, and essential building and engineering services allowed Departments and local authorities to continue to deliver critical functions throughout the pandemic.<\/p><p>At peak season, the OPW employs approximately 1,400 full-time and seasonal State industrial staff in drainage, maintenance, visitor services, flood relief, hydrometrics, national historic properties, national monuments and the President's household staff.  State industrial staff are employed in essential roles at many sites including the Houses of the Oireachtas, Farmleigh House, the Phoenix Park and Dublin Castle.  They work various shifts.  Some shifts are five days over seven and some sites are manned over 24 hours.<\/p><p>The non-established grade employment contracts, which the Senator mentioned, in the OPW are technically classified as industrial employees and are recruited to the OPW in a non-established capacity.  I understand that they enjoy the same terms and conditions as industrial employees in other areas of the civil service.  A non-established State employee or industrial employee is a person employed in a whole-time capacity by a Department or office who is not an established civil servant.<\/p><p>Non-established State employees are not covered by the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956.  State industrial employees are regarded as those grades designated under section 23(3) of the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  State industrial employees are excluded from the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme but are covered by the range of general employment laws and have access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court on matters of pay and conditions.<\/p><p>The OPW continues to follow Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, guidelines on the employment classification of non-established industrial staff.  The policy is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and is not something the OPW has any authority to change.  This also applies to all other public service bodies with State industrial staff.  The Senator mentioned a delay with regard to DPER.  This is a matter for DPER.  The OPW does not have authority to change it.  I suggest it may be worthwhile for the Senator to correspond directly with DPER or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who may be able to give her further detail on her queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#B00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":14,"content":"<p>The issue is that while the response has outlined the contractual arrangements for the non-established offices, the reality is that DPER has acknowledged this is an issue.

We need progress on that because we have people who have 30 years' experience working as guides within the OPW and have no path of progression within the job they have chosen to do.  Many of them have taken on masters courses in heritage and history for which they are not compensated.  There is no facility for training within the OPW other than first aid courses.  Some employees are multilingual.  They have taken on extra languages at their own expense and yet there is no acknowledgement of this in their pay and conditions.

I raised the issue of summer provision last week on the Order of Business and I tabled the Commencement matter on Friday.  Thankfully, however, the Department released details of the summer provision programme yesterday.  It is a great programme.  In 2021, the budget doubled to &euro;40 million, which shows the seriousness of the Minister of State's commitment to the programme.  Unfortunately, there was a delay this year in announcing the programme and that delay meant 26 out of 126 special schools have said they will not be running the programme due to the delay.  Last year, the programme was announced on 11 May and only &euro;15 million of the budget was actually used.<\/p> <p>What effort is the Department making to ensure that schools are incentivised to run these programmes?  They mean so much to families and the children who participate in them.  For families, it is some respite.  The summer is a daunting time for the families of children with additional needs because they do not have the extra childcare, and for some children who do not have other friends it is their only social outlet.  It is very important to incentivise schools to open these programmes.  Perhaps the Minister of State will contact the 26 schools that have decided they will not be able to run the programme.  Next year, perhaps the Department might be able to announce details of the programme before Easter just to give schools a chance to get their logistics in order.  Schools are outlining to us the difficulties they have with regard to staffing, the pay rates and the late communication from the Department in respect of the programme.<\/p> <p>There is a major commitment from the Department, which is very welcome, but we have to do a little more to ensure that these programmes happen.  It might be the case that the Minister of State will have to mandate schools to run these programmes for children with additional needs because they do not stop having additional needs during the summer months.  The barriers and obstacles before families do not go away for the summer.  Having all this time off creates a huge amount of anxiety for families.  Something could be done about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#D00200","speaker":"1630"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":18,"content":"<p>I note the Senator's particular interest in the area of special education in general.  We were very pleased to announce this programme yesterday.  There is a new package for the summer programme for this year.  We have matched the funding from last year of &euro;40 million for children with additional needs.  It will also help Ukrainian children in terms of the inclusion programme.<\/p> <p>First, there is the inclusion programme in primary school.  It is a two-week to three-week programme for mainstream pupils with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  There is also a special classes and special schools programme in primary schools, which is a two-week to five-week programme.  Then we have delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, numeracy and literacy camps, or campa&iacute; samhraidh, in DEIS primary schools, which will be for one week, and inclusive programmes for all post-primary schools, which is two weeks for students with complex needs and those at risk of disadvantage.  There is also home-based provision where there is no school-based programme available.<\/p> <p>The aim of the summer programme is to enhance well-being for children with additional needs.  There are arts-based programmes, sports activities, music, drama and language development.  Curricular subjects are looked at and there is obviously vocational support as well, particularly for post-primary children who may be at risk of leaving school so they can future plan for what they need to do.<\/p> <p>I understand the Senator's point about encouraging and incentivising schools to participate in this programme.  There are 4,000 schools, since the first time last year, that are eligible to apply.  We listened to their feedback and concerns from last year and we are confident that there will be more of an increase in participation this year.  Some of the concerns that were addressed were about funding.  Schools were looking for funding for a programme overseer so we have dealt with that.  Regarding preparation time, it is 4 May today which is the earliest the programme has ever been announced.  We believe there is sufficient time for schools now to plan for it.  There are faster payments for staff.  If the staff in a school are not available to participate in the summer programme the school can hire staff outside, which should help.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Josepha Madigan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is also an easing of the administrative burden on schools and greater guidance materials are also given in that context.<\/p><p>There are obviously enhanced measures to encourage participation by the schools, including the recruiting of final year students, which can be done for the first time, and they should be able to help, as well as the centralised application process.  There is an online registration which is open from today for schools to apply to register their interest.  There is also flexibility for the schools so they can run the programmes at whatever time suits them or split the weeks during the summer which, again, is feedback we received.  This year, we had advocacy groups which were involved in the development of the summer programme so they could give us the feedback from their members as to what exactly they wanted.

We are all looking forward to debating the report of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.  I welcome the indications by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, that there will be an increase in defence spending of the order of about &euro;500 million, although, on the basis of the recommendations within the commission report, this could be viewed as somewhat conservative, even though it is about a 50% increase.  The commission set out very clearly that it believes we should be looking at being ambitious to bring Ireland in line in our spending on defence with similar-sized EU countries.  If we take the example of Finland, one of our fellow non-aligned countries and of similar size, it currently has a budget of &euro;2.8 billion, almost three times that of Ireland, and recently announced an increase of &euro;2 billion in spending.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State may be aware of the comments yesterday by the Chief of Staff, Lieutenant-General Se&aacute;n Clancy, around the adequacy of the Defence Forces.  This Commencement matter had been tabled in advance of his address but he did make the point that if we are to ensure that we can protect our sovereignty, particularly in light of what has happened in Ukraine, then we must have adequate investment in our Defence Forces.<\/p> <p>My question today is around Ireland's defence capabilities in the event of an attack.  People traditionally think about attacks as soldiers on the ground, marching over a border and invading a country, as we have seen in Ukraine, but that is not the nature of modern warfare.  What we see increasingly is incursions into airspace, into our maritime area and, more and more, in cyberspace.  I do not believe that Ireland is sufficiently well defended, nor do I believe we can defend our sovereignty in the event of an attack from an alien power.<\/p> <p>If we look at some of the specific areas, for example, in terms of a potential air incursion, we have inadequate radar to be able to pick that up.  Where we have had incidents in the past of Russian aircraft illegally operating in Irish space, we rely on the Royal Air Force to defend us in those circumstances.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Malcolm Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Not so long ago we had a maritime incursion.  In this hybrid attack by Russia, which was an invasion of our sovereignty, we saw Russian warships based off the south-west coast of Ireland.

Last year we saw what I would regard as a terrorist attack, the cyberattack on the HSE.  We will see more and more of those.  It is not unreasonable to expect that if Ireland votes in a particular way at the UN Security Council, all the traffic lights in Dublin will go down.<\/p><p>This is not the world of science fiction; it is the reality of what we are facing.  As we are now having debates on food security and energy security, we need our debates on defence capability to be broader than those simply focused on the Department of Defence.  We should co-operate with Sweden, Finland, Austria and the other non-aligned countries.  I hope the Minister of State will answer my questions on behalf of the Department today.

It is the Government's intention that the new vessel will provide flexible and adaptable capability for a wide range of maritime tasks.<\/p><p>The White Paper, in addressing Air Corps capability, provided for the replacement of the Cessna and Casa 235 fleets.  The Cessnas have now been replaced by three Pilatus PC-12 aircraft in the intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, ISTAR, role, providing a substantially increased capability with their state-of-the-art surveillance technology.  A further Pilatus PC-12 was procured arising from the demands of Covid.  A contract for the supply of two C295 maritime patrol aircraft to replace the two Casa 235s was signed with Airbus in 2019, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  The C295s are larger and more capable than those they replace and will enable the Air Corps to conduct maritime patrols and surveillance across Ireland's area of maritime interest, with enhanced capabilities.<\/p><p>While the primary role of the Defence Forces with regard to cybersecurity, which the Senator mentioned, relates to the defence and security of their own networks and systems, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces are committed to participating, under the leadership of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, in the delivery of measures to improve the cybersecurity of the State.  The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the national development plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022-25 timeframe.  Within that capital allocation, the Defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million.  This will enable continued investment in defence equipment, including major platforms and barracks infrastructure.<\/p><p>The report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which the Senator mentioned, and the current events in Ukraine are prompting an open debate and consideration of our defence requirements.  I fully accept there is an ongoing requirement to consider whether the capabilities we maintain are appropriate, having regard to the security environment, the roles that we wish the Defence Forces to undertake and the likely risks.  The report of the commission was published on 9 February 2022, as the Senator knows.  The commission's terms of reference included the consideration of appropriate capability, structures and staffing for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.  I understand the commission's report is being fully considered in consultation with other Ministers and stakeholders.

My question is on our defence capability.  If we faced an air or sea incursion or a serious cyberattack on critical infrastructure in the State, can we be confident we would be able to address those attacks?  As an independent, sovereign State, one of the marks of sovereignty is being able to defend and protect that sovereignty, but on the basis of the response and the evidence presented, it is very clear Ireland cannot defend its sovereignty in the event of an air incursion, an incident in the maritime space or a cyberattack.  I appreciate that significantly more investment is happening, but if such attacks now happen, it is very clear from the response given here that we do not have the capability to deal with them.  In terms of the role of the State, the defence of our sovereignty is one of the most important responsibilities.

He very much welcomes the open discussion and debate around whether we can defend our sovereignty.  That is the pertinent question that needs to be teased out.  The Irish people need to be reassured we have adequate defence mechanisms.  The Senator mentioned the prospect of Russia invading our space, so to speak, and the British Royal Air Force having to come into our waters.  He also spoke about the risks to the transatlantic cables and about cybersecurity.  I have noted all of those points and will raise them with the Minister for Defence.<\/p> <p>On the issue of threat assessments and the two White Papers I mentioned earlier, my understanding is the assessments have indicated a low probability of a conventional military attack on the State.  However, they also point to the fact that security channels are such that no single country can deal with these threats alone.  That is important in terms of context.  I can assure the Senator that the Minister Defence is committed to this work and has said so on numerous occasions.  As Senator Byrne mentioned, the Minister is increasing the budget for the Defence Forces.  I also note what the Senator said about Finland, a similar-sized country, and the amount of money it is spending.  I do not think any conversation should be off the table on this particular issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#G00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","time":1651669200,"counter":29,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#G00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.

This has not been an easy issue to deal with as it is complex and diverse, with many strands to it.  There are many stakeholders involved, with the lives of many individuals and those of their children, families and guardians affected, and there are a range of dynamics at play relating to this very sensitive and difficult issue.<\/p> <p>I also acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth - what a mouthful - in seeking written submissions from individuals or groups on the general scheme of the mother and baby institutions payment scheme Bill.  I looked at the Oireachtas website before coming in here this afternoon and was reminded that the closing date for receipt of submissions is 1 p.m. on Friday, 6 May 2022.

It is proposed the scheme will provide for financial payments and-or an enhanced medical card to defined groups in acknowledgement of the suffering experienced while resident in mother and baby home institutions.  I also understand the scheme will be administered by an independent executive office within the Department.<\/p><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  What are the timelines in respect of the scheme?  When does he think the first supports, such as the enhanced medical card, which is important, will be available?  It is not all about money, and I sometimes think that message is lost.  People who experienced various issues around this subject need ongoing supports, to which the Government has strongly committed.  My focus today is on the enhanced medical card.<\/p><p>There are people who need supports.  I meet people who have issues with accessing mental health supports.  They are being turned away from counselling services.  They may choose not to go to certain counselling services because of previous experience with them, or they feel they do not have trust in a service, or they want some sort of independent counselling service, or they want to avail of a service that is somewhat impartial and away from other members of their family or a spouse.  There are many good reasons that may be the case.<\/p><p>Will the Minister outline the current position regarding the enhanced medical card, how quickly we can get that up and running, and when the scheme will be rolled out?  Perhaps he might also make any other comments he might have on matter.

The provision of a form of enhanced medical card to survivors through the mother and baby institutions payments scheme will require the establishment of legislative and administrative structures to provide statutory access to the relevant health services, assess eligibility and carefully manage and share the relevant personal data with the HSE in respect of the issuing of these cards.<\/p><p>Given the scale and significance of the approved proposals for the mother and baby institutions payment scheme, an integrated piece of legislation is being prepared to encompass both aspects of the scheme, that is, the financial payments and the enhanced medical cards of which the Senator spoke.  This approach will make the scheme much more user-friendly as survivors will only have to make one application to be considered for both aspects of the scheme.  Last month, I secured Government approval for the heads of a Bill for the mother and baby institutional payments scheme and the referral of the heads of the Bill to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.  I sought priority drafting for the Bill to ensure it can be introduced to the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as possible.<\/p><p>I have also referred the draft heads of the Bill to the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I have requested its assistance in meeting the urgent need to deliver the scheme for survivors as soon as possible.  Like the Senator, I thank the committee for its speedy response in that regard as it quickly launched a public consultation on the general scheme of the Bill.  As the Senator mentioned, the deadline for that is Friday, 6 May.  My officials and I look forward to engaging with the committee during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.<\/p><p>Once the legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas and the administrative infrastructure required to deliver the scheme has been established, the scheme will open for applications for financial awards and enhanced medical cards.  It is my hope we can get this Bill passed in the autumn term and open the scheme for initial applications in late 2022.  That is the timeline I am operating towards.<\/p><p>A person will be eligible for an enhanced medical card if he or she was resident in a relevant institution for six months or more.  The card will provide access to the same suite of services offered to those who hold the Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia<\/i>scheme medical card.  For those eligible applicants who live outside of Ireland, they will have the choice of accepting a once-off health support payment of &euro;3,000 instead of the medical card, if they wish.

If eligible people prefer to take the medical card instead of the once-off health support payment, this would mean that when they are visiting Ireland, or if they were ever to move back here, they would be able to avail of our health services using this enhanced medical card.<\/p><p>The Senator spoke about other supports and it is important to note that beyond the institutional payments scheme, and as part of the broader action plan in response to the report of the commission, counselling support has been made available to all survivors since before the publication of the commission&rsquo;s final report.  It is being provided through the national counselling service which has been strengthened with additional investment and an expanded out-of-hours service.  It is important to say as well that counselling is available free of charge and survivors of institutions are entitled to priority access to that free counselling service.<\/p><p>Additionally, the Department of Health, in partnership with the HSE, is working on establishing a patient liaison advocacy service.  When up and running, that service will have a dedicated team that can provide bespoke information and supports to survivors to assist them in accessing the health services they may need.  The Department of Health is also working with the Health Research Board on a research project to identify the further health needs of survivors.  This research will help to further inform future health policy and service responses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#H00200","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":34,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that informative response.

It is critically important that this message regarding eligibility is disseminated and that to do so we tap into our connections with the diaspora, as well as making contact through our embassy.  We have an amazing network of Irish support groups across the UK and it is also critically important this message is got out to them.<\/p> <p>There may also be issues regarding the conditionality of the &euro;3,000 payment.

When I was in the US as part of the week of festivities celebrating St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, I met with a group of survivors.  It ended up being online, but I met with that group from the US.  I had hoped to meet them in person, but that did not work out.  It was just good to meet them and hear from them directly, although it was not the first time I met with that group.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to the Chamber.<\/p> <p>I have raised this topic on a number of occasions with the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who has been in the House a number of times, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.  Unfortunately, the senior Minister has not been to the Chamber as I would like to raise directly with him the ongoing and long-running saga of the new emergency department for University Hospital Galway, UHG.  We been talking for a long number of years about the need for a new emergency department.  When the Taoiseach, the Minister of State&rsquo;s party leader, appeared before us before Christmas, I reminded him that he raised this matter with the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, in 2015.  The then Taoiseach responded at the time that the emergency department in Galway was not fit for purpose.  It had not been fit for purpose for a long time before or since and it is not fit for purpose now.<\/p> <p>There are plans for a new emergency department, including a paediatrics and maternity ward beside the existing emergency department.  Works are ongoing on a new temporary emergency department to allow for decanting and the construction of a new emergency department.  I have said in respect of many construction projects that nothing can be built without planning permission.  We have not even reached the stage in Galway where a planning application has been lodged for a new emergency department.<\/p> <p>When the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, visited Galway in September 2018 he was told by the Saolta University Health Care Group that a planning application would be lodged before Christmas 2018.  The project specification has changed somewhat since then, which I appreciate.  However, considering that the project was so advanced at that stage, with so much work having been done on finalising the design, I still cannot get my head around the fact that all of these years later, and accepting Covid-19 and all that goes with it, we have not yet got to the stage where we can give a concrete date for lodging the planning application.  That is without mentioning all the other phases - I hope of course that planning permission will be granted - of detailed design, tender documents, contractors and construction.<\/p> <p>There is a long way to go in this process and I understand from engagement with the Saolta group that this project still has to go to the HSE board, the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Cabinet for signing off before a planning application can be lodged.  If she has been provided with the information, I ask the Minister of State to set out some timelines for those stages, the current position in relation to them, whether they can be completed in a short period and whether it is just a case of rubber-stamping them.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State will appreciate the frustration in Galway, particularly among hospital staff and those who have received excellent care in the hospital but have endured conditions that are less than ideal and which, in the words of Enda Kenny, are not fit for purpose.  She will understand the frustration among staff, management and members of the public in Galway.  As I said, people have received excellent healthcare but the facilities are not what they should be for a centre of excellence in a regional capital of the west covering an area that extends from Donegal to Galway.  I hope the Minister of State will provide some better news than I have received heretofore.  There needs to be some concrete dates on the delivery of this project, the lodging of the planning application and the various stages to allow it to proceed to construction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#K00100","speaker":"1665"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":38,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.

While improving service delivery capability, the interim emergency department and associated works will also serve as enabling works for the larger project the Senator spoke about, freeing up the site required for a proposed new block.<\/p><p>I am aware that this project has been discussed for the past ten years and I share the frustration of the team in Galway and the patients there.  One of the reasons the project is still in the development phase is that there has been a significant increase in the scale and ambition for the solution on the Galway site.  Originally the proposal was for a new multistorey emergency department block, but now the proposals, driven by local requirements and the need to better utilise a constricted site, mean the Department of Health will shortly receive proposals costed in the hundreds of millions.  The estimated cost is likely to be in the region of &euro;275 million to &euro;300 million, significantly higher than the &euro;65 million to &euro;120 million cost for the original proposal.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, all projects proposed in excess of &euro;100 million must be subject to the full scrutiny of the public spending code process.  The public spending code is designed to ensure that investment decisions are underpinned by a clear policy rationale and costs are well understood.  This ensures that maximum value for money for the taxpayer, through disciplined project evaluation, preparation and implementation, can be achieved.  The HSE is drafting a strategic assessment report to ensure full compliance with public spending code requirements.  I expect this to be submitted to the Department later this month.  If granted approval in principle, the preliminary business case, which is at an advanced stage of drafting, will be subject to the external assurance process prior to the submission of the final business case to Government for decision.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that following the &euro;13 million capital investment, the interim emergency department, which will provide critical services, is expected to be completed by end of June 2022.

This Commencement matter is on the provision of a new fire station in Ballymahon, County Longford, an area with which the Minister of State is very familiar.  It is an issue I raised on the Order of Business in February.  At present the fire station in Ballymahon is located in a hired out industrial estate in the middle of a housing estate.  It is not suitable for a town of its size.  It is more than two and a half years since Longford County Council submitted a request for a new fire station for the town.  Since then Center Parcs has opened in Ballymahon.  It is the biggest tourism infrastructure project in the country.  The park attracts between 2,000 and 2,500 visitors to the town each week.<\/p> <p>The fire station has nine retained staff.  In 2021, there were 53 call outs and there have been more than 30 call outs so far this year.  These consist of fires, road traffic collisions, ambulance assists and special services.  The firefighters there are trained as cardiac first responders and emergency fire responders.  The population of the town has increased yearly since the 2011 census when it was 1,563.  In the 2016 census the population was 1,877.  It is expected to rise to more than 2,000 in the most recent census.  Along with this increase in population there is Center Parcs, Thomond Lodge nursing home and retirement village, a large daycare centre in the town, the Kepak processing plant, which is a large employer in the town, and numerous other units.  The town is also home to St. Matthew's Primary School, one of the biggest primary schools in the county.  There are also two post-primary schools in the town with Ballymahon Vocational School and the Mercy Secondary School.  Ballymahon fire service also covers areas in the boundary of County Westmeath<\/p> <p>Longford County Council has identified a site.  It is simply incredible to think that a town of this size does not have an up-to-date, up-to-standard fire station.

Last year I asked departmental officials to liaise with Longford County Council on this matter.  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003.  The Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters, and providing capital funding for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.<\/p> <p>In December 2020, a new fire services capital programme was announced for the period 2021-25, with a funding allocation of &euro;61 million.  The Department's fire services capital programme for the period 2021-25 allows for continued investment at an appropriate level in our fire services.

The council has submitted a preliminary appraisal and outline plans to the Department, and I understand a site has been identified, as the Senator quite rightly pointed out in his opening contribution.<\/p><p>The project consideration stages in my Department include the submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals, submission of a design brief, selection of a site, which was already spoken about, an application for approval in principle, the appointment of design consultants, submission of a preliminary design, planning application, submission of a preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans, and the tender process and construction stages.<\/p><p>While a new fire station at Ballymahon is not currently included in the Department's 2021-2025 capital programme, it has now been included on the list for review.  Projects in the capital programme are soon to be reassessed to maximise the available capital programme funding.  This includes consideration of additional fire station projects from fire authorities which fit the normal fire station project criteria and where an appropriate business case is presented.  Priority may be adjusted to bring forward projects that offer best value for money and take into account the state of readiness of the projects.<\/p><p>I have asked the Department to keep me and the Senator updated on this very important matter.  I expect the reassessment to be scheduled and concluded for quarter 3 of this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#M00300","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":47,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

There are still some outstanding issues in other countries.  As a result, we see our tourism industry beginning to recover and there is no doubt that scheduled flights are very much back on track, with passenger numbers increasing.  I am thankful the frequency of flights is starting to recover.  This is all really positive for a major dimension of our domestic economy, namely, tourism and the hosting of international tourists.<\/p> <p>I will speak, however, to what can only be described as price-gouging and an outrageous approach to pricing that is taking place in the hotel sector, particularly here in Dublin.  People had mentioned this to me so I did a small bit of analysis in the office before coming here and the numbers bear this out.<\/p> <p>A hotel room for two nights, Friday and Saturday, next weekend comes to over &euro;700 for two people in a four star hotel in this city.  I did some comparisons and in Berlin the same stay would cost approximately &euro;300 and in Paris it would be approximately &euro;450.  In London it would cost &euro;500 and in Lisbon it would cost &euro;300.  In 2019, the average price for a room in Dublin was approximately &euro;150 per night.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Timmy Dooley:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That would be &euro;300 or &euro;350 at weekends, so during the space of the pandemic, the price has doubled.<\/p><p>I understand the hospitality sector has taken a very significant battering over the period of the pandemic but the hotel sector succeeded and survived with the support of the citizens of the State because, on behalf of the Irish people, the Government invested very significant amounts of money in the sector.  The hospitality sector received about &euro;1.6 billion in the employment wage subsidy scheme, which was 29% of all payments.  A total of &euro;717 million was provided under the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme while the figure for debt warehousing was &euro;2.9 billion.  Not all of that went to the hospitality sector but it certainly contributed to the survival of those businesses.  I know these businesses need to recover but they cannot expect to recoup all their losses in the course of a year because that approach will damage our image internationally.  As I said, the price of a weekend stay here is nearly twice that of our main competitors across Europe when we take in Berlin, Paris, London and Lisbon.  There is something wrong there.<\/p><p>Perhaps the Deputy Leader would arrange a debate on tourism and the obvious threats to our tourism product development.  We can thrash it out and, it is hoped, get the views of the Minister as to how we might approach this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#T00300","speaker":"1655","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>I wish to raise an issue relating to NCT centres.  Obviously, Covid has had an impact over a long period of time with regard to the NCT certificate, how long it is valid for and extensions.  Considering that in some parts of the country, it will be months before a person will get a date for an NCT, how does that affect the validity of a person's certificate is if he or she has an accident?  It is an issue because in certain parts of Dublin city, a person will not get a test before the autumn.  If his or her NCT is up, what is the legal standing of the person driving the car if he or she has an accident?  From what I understand, if someone is pulled over by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and does not have a valid certificate, he or she could get penalty points.  Will the Deputy Leader contact the relevant Minister or the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to provide some clarity on this because it is an issue of concern?  It is always the case there is never a problem with insurance until you have an accident and go looking to claim.  That is when issues can arise so there could be people who are affected in that regard.<\/p> <p>I also request a debate on our capital plan and capital projects.  I raised a Commencement Matter issue regarding a very important project for Galway city and county, namely, the new emergency department at University Hospital Galway.  Since I spoke on the matter in this House in January, it has gone backwards.  Three months on, it is still going backwards.  There is no certainty with regard to the delivery of this very important project, not taking into account any of the inflationary pressures regarding the price of the project.  This concerns getting consent to lodge a planning application for a project that in 2015 was deemed not to be fit for purpose by the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny when questioned by the current Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the D&aacute;il.  This project is vital for the region.  Saolta University Health Care Group promised that a planning application would be lodged before Christmas 2018 and here we are in 2022, albeit with a changed specification for the project, and we have seen no progress.  This is one of a number of projects.  For any large project, from when we start talking about it to when the tape is cut on it, we could be talking about seven, eight or ten years.  People tend not to believe anymore what is being said about these projects until such time as the diggers actually go in to start construction, and it is a concern of mine regarding the processes in place for our capital projects.<\/p> <p>I ask for a debate on capital infrastructure in the country.

It is the most important election not just in a generation but in the history of Northern Ireland.  It is an opportunity for a new beginning.  A few days ago, I attended a funeral in Northern Ireland for the late canon, Fr. Pat McHugh.  He was a kind, decent pastoral priest who was full to the brim of compassion and passion.  The funeral cortege made the short journey on foot from his home in Killynoogan to Pettigo in the Republic of Ireland.  It reminded me in stark terms of how partition caused such havoc, especially around the Border.<\/p> <p>Fr. McHugh was a wonderful man and a super English teacher at St. Macartan's College.  On one occasion before the Good Friday Agreement, Fr. McHugh had to assert his civil rights when the RUC was around.  Thankfully, those days are behind us.  The irony was not lost on me that a police officer from the Police Service of Northern Ireland helped with traffic duties during the course of the funeral.  The officer told me that things are better these days although there is still work to do.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

During the course of those renovations over several months, he was welcomed with open arms into the local Church of Ireland.  Pat and Reverend Neal Phair were ahead of their time.  That is a glimpse of a better Northern Ireland for everyone.  Part of the liturgy at the funeral were the words of Luke 10:5, which have a resonance today as we face the election, \"Whatever house you enter, first say, \"Peace be to this house\".  I hope that when people return to the house at Stormont they bear that in mind and they adopt the peaceful way of mutual respect and tolerance, in fact, not just tolerance, but celebrate the enrichment of diversity.

However, we are not seeing a clear pathway out of this issue so it would be timely for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to address it.  We should have statements on the issues currently facing the Passport Office and, in particular, the issues currently facing its customers.

The DiscoverEU programme gave 35,000 18-year-olds across the European Union a one-month free interrail pass.  Unfortunately, 18-year-olds from the Six Counties will not be able to apply for that.

The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has given directions to local authorities that they are no longer allowed to buy second-hand properties and have to focus on one-bedroom properties and apartments.  While on paper that can seem very laudable, it does have the unintended and very dangerous consequence of people in receipt of social supports through the housing assistance payment, HAP, or the renal accommodation scheme, RAS, and who are living in rented accommodation being evicted from their rental accommodation and the local authority is not able to buy it.  This is a particular concern because while it has operated imperfectly, it has still saved many families from homelessness.  We know that people coming from the private rental sector, particularly those who are on social supports, where HAP limits have not been revised since 2016, are the number one type of family who are entering homelessness.<\/p><p>We get the figures for homelessness at the end of every month and, last month, 1,238 families entered homelessness, which was 58 more than the previous month.  Since the lifting of the eviction ban, we have seen family homelessness increase and come back again.  While I understand somewhat the rationale for that direction to local authorities and the limits placed upon it, the Minister should make an exception for tenants <i>in situ<\/i>.  It has operated as an imperfect method of homelessness prevention, especially for families and children, and we do not want to see children entering homelessness and spending their school years living in precarious housing.<\/p><p>I also raise the issue of the very concerning reports we are hearing from the US Supreme Court in regard to overturning Roe <i>v.<\/i>Wade.  I say this in the context of the rowback on abortion rights generally, what is happening in Poland and Texas, and certain state legislatures rowing back on access, for example, Oklahoma and Tennessee, where people from Texas had been going.  It is very concerning for women in the US, many of whom are very frightened, in particular low-income women.  Having an absolute ban on abortion does not stop abortions but makes them unsafe and ensures low-income people are particularly affected.  I send my solidarity in particular to women in the states that will be affected &ndash; Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee - and to women in Poland.  As we know, the march of progress is not always forward and it does roll back.  We always need to be vigilant in making sure reproductive rights are protected worldwide.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#X00300","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":69,"content":"<p>Last weekend marked the all-Ireland confined drama finals in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and it was won by a drama group from Kilmuckridge, County Wexford.

There are many people who have worked for decades and campaigned tirelessly for a university in Waterford and for the south-east region.  Thankfully, it came to fruition over the weekend.<\/p> <p>At certain times in politics, one has to take a leap.  Certainly, that is what has been done with SETU.  There are many who sat on the fence throughout the entire process and who continue to do so.  If things go in the wrong direction, they will say \"I told you so\".  If they go in the right direction, they will say they always supported the technological university.

Yesterday was a step change in that regard.

Our hearty congratulations go to her from this House.<\/p> <p>I wish to voice a concern shared by many others.  It relates to the decision to use student accommodation to house Ukrainian refugees during the summer months.  I understand the difficulties faced by the Government in housing and providing for the people we have taken in, and how it would not sit well to have bedsits empty while there are those in need of them.  I understand how this idea came about.  However, the obvious concern, which is in the minds of many, relates to what will happen in September.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, said the accommodation is to be made available in the short term to allow time for other options to be availed of.  If that happens and everything goes without a hitch, it will be wonderful.  However, we have never had to look too far in this country to see short-term solutions that have lingered long past their due date.  That, of course, is simply not an option here.<\/p> <p>The apprehension is that if things do not all go according to plan and long-term accommodation is not found for everyone who needs it, the Government, a university or other body will be put in the position of having to evict refugees from student housing, or students who have paid for their housing will not be able to use it as it is occupied.  Either way, the Government may well have to put the Irish people and our resident Ukrainians on a public-opinion collision course.  Already we have seen a significant amount of public discourse on the concerted efforts of the Government to house the refugees we have taken in, which contrasts with the apparent lack of a similar effort in addressing the homelessness crisis.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Sharon Keogan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The prevailing question is: if the Government can do that for them, why can it not do it for us?

Since Mr. Cassells produced that report, we have seen an additional &euro;1 billion provided for college education.  The Taoiseach has been extremely strong on the need to ensure additional funding was directed to that sphere.  While I welcome the additional &euro;370 million in core funding announced today, it is imperative now that the Minister delivers on his statement today to reduce student contribution fees.

I welcome that pause.  We need to hear the details of the scrutiny that is going to be allowed for in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  We also need to understand that the concerns that will be articulated during that period will be taken into account.  In the Ireland of 2022, it is simply unthinkable that a new hospital funded with almost &euro;1 billion of taxpayers' money would involve anything other than full State control.<\/p> <p>I looked at the draft constitution and articles of association for the hospital this morning.  I am more alarmed than I had been previously with regard to what I understood to be the legal arrangements for the hospital.  Despite the best efforts of some, it is not a simple relocation of the hospital from Holles Street to Elm Park.  It is not the case that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, SVHG, has a seat on the board of directors just to look after the plot of land on which the hospital will be situated.  It is something much bigger than that.  The Minister and SVHG will be the only two members of the new hospital.  The SVHG will have 99 shares and the Minister will have one golden share which, to be honest, is framed ambiguously.  It is the case that the SVHG will have the power to appoint the chair of the board when the chair rotates once every six years.<\/p> <p>The question has to be asked as to why the State is allowing any involvement of a private entity in what was to be a public hospital.  We in the Labour Party and other parties have talked about the need for this to be a public hospital on publicly owned land.  If we accept for a moment the 299-year lease, I do not know of any other commercial situation in which the owners of a site have such major involvement in the governance and operation of a building.  It is simply untenable that the State would put that amount of money into a site and not own the land.  There is enough money owed by the Religious Sisters of Charity to the State, through the residential redress scheme following the Ryan report of 2002 to 2009, to ensure the land should be handed over by the SVHG to the State.  Money should not be passed over.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#AA00200","speaker":"1683"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Today, the funding the future report was launched.

The report published by the Journal.ie today of an investigation carried out by Noteworthy.ie came on foot of a complaint made by Mr. Martin McMahon.  It appears data on journeys undertaken by holders of free travel passes were held by the Department of Social Protection until 2020, when an order was given for the complete deletion of the database.  This raises serious questions for the Department of Social Protection, because it appears that the journey data on the integrated ticketing system could be linked back to the personal details of free travel pass holders.  On reviewing the evidence in the public domain so far, a data protection expert said he believed the type of monitoring and surveillance that was being carried out represented \"a profound interference in the privacy and data protection rights and freedoms\" of those free travel pass holders.<\/p> <p>It also seems the whole process was carried out because there was a suspicion that free travel passes were being abused.  However, the data showed 0.0004% of free travel journeys were fraudulent.  When we look at the timing of this mass surveillance of free travel pass holders, what is most striking is that it came not long after the now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, launched his \"Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All&rdquo; campaign.  That campaign was roundly and rightly criticised at the time and it was called a hate campaign by one former social welfare worker.  In that case as well, the level of fraud found was as similarly minuscule as the level found in this instance concerning the free travel passes.  Now that we know the Data Protection Commissioner is carrying out an investigation of the database that was held by the Department of Social Protection, we should hear from the Minister regarding who ordered this mass surveillance, on what legal basis it was carried out, who ordered the deletion of the database and how much public money was spent on setting up such a database.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#BB00400","speaker":"1635"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":84,"content":"<p>Over the past couple of weeks, while we were all in recess, the numbers on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick increased to new record levels.

I am sure we all join her in wishing Katie well.  She has done a phenomenal service to the sport of boxing and to girls and women in boxing.  Her achievements will be hard to beat by subsequent women coming through.  She has done fantastic work.  Senator Keogan also spoke about the use of student accommodation for Ukrainian refugees and raised concerns about what will happen in September.  The Minister had said it is a short-term solution.  We need to ensure we have accommodation for students.  We will have to wait and hope we can find more permanent solutions for those fleeing the war.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That it is probably a good use of that accommodation.

He also referenced the ongoing HRT issues and the shortage that is being experienced by many women across the country.  It is an ongoing issue.  We have been told that there is a global shortage and that supply will increase in June or July.  The Government, pharmacies, the medical profession and pharmaceutical companies could do more to meet the demand at a quicker pace.  The Senator supported the call for a debate on the hospitality sector.<\/p><p>Senator Cassells referred to the announcement this morning of funding for higher education and referenced the report that his uncle, Mr. Peter Cassells, published six years ago that has yet to be properly acted upon.  That work is under way and we look forward to debating the matter with the Minister in this House in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about a recent report on women presenting with ovarian cancer and gave the stark number that between 300 and 400 women have come forward.  She spoke about her concerns, as she has often done in this House, about University Hospital Limerick and the huge number of sick people on trolleys.  I know that there is a particular acute issue in that hospital.  She is concerned that people may have their diagnosis delayed because they have been unable to access services as quickly as they should do.  The Minister for Health has appointed a special committee to look at the situation in UHL and we hope the situation is resolved shortly. <\/p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the new national maternity hospital.  She welcomed that the approval by Cabinet to proceed with building has been paused, as does Senator Higgins.  From the Government's perspective, we have spent almost ten years looking to get this hospital built.  The project was signed off by the previous Government.  Significant changes have been made.  It was a 150-year lease but the duration has now been doubled to a 299-year lease, which is a long time to lease land.  The building will be owned by the State and the HSE.  A service level agreement will be given to St. Vincent's Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital to run the services.  We are assured that all legally permissible services that are currently available, and legislated for, will be provided at the new maternity hospital as is currently provided in the existing maternity hospital.  However, I am very persuaded by the very strong arguments that have been made by so many senior clinicians like Dr. Rhona O'Mahony, Professor Shane Higgins, who is the current master of the National Maternity Hospital, and over 50 clinicians who work in the maternity hospital.  There is a strong clinical argument, which I say as a layperson, that co-location is best for women and girls.  I find it really concerning that women who are very seriously and critically ill in the National Maternity Hospital must be put in the back of an ambulance to be transferred to St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital because the National Maternity Hospital does not have an ICU and there is no critical care capacity in the current maternity hospital.  That issue needs to be addressed.<\/p><p>I hear the concerns that have been raised but very few alternative proposals to resolve these issues have been put forward by those who have expressed concerns.  I plead with them to do so.  Clinicians who work on a day-to-day basis in obstetrics and gynaecology in the maternity hospital have expressed their concerns.  I can see from their contributions on different programmes that they are deeply frustrated at the ongoing delays.  These are the doctors who deliver care so I trust and I am reassured by what they have told us.  I welcome the publication of the legal framework for all of us to scrutinise as parliamentarians, which is our role, and the Minister for Health will engage with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  It is positive to have that space to do that out of respect for the genuine concerns expressed by genuine people, which have been raised.  My sincere hope is that the project gets under way without further delay because the prospect of waiting another decade is simply not good enough.<\/p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the investment in higher education and the significant investment of &euro;307 million.  We will arrange a debate as quickly as we can.<\/p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke about his attendance at the RIC commemoration in London.  He expressed his disappointed that a similar commemoration could not be held here and I take on board his comments.  The backlash in this country was because the Black and Tans were part of the RIC.  So there is a genuine link between them and that anger was very real.<\/p><p>Senator Boylan mentioned the illegal retention of data by the Department of Social Protection.  I do not have the full details about the issue.  I suggest that she tables a Commencement matter to start with and if that is not sufficient then we will look to get a debate scheduled with the Minister in attendance.  The Senator has the support of Senator Higgins to delve further into the issue.<\/p><p>Senator Conway spoke about University Hospital Limerick and the number of people on trolleys.  He asked for a wider debate on emergency departments across the country.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lisa Chambers:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->He has welcomed the third level funding as well.<\/p><p>I think I have dealt with Senator Higgins's main concerns about the maternity hospital.

Section 19 sets out the terms of the various committees it is intended to set up.  It does not specifically name some of the committees.  This amendment and the subsequent amendments seek to require two specific sub-committees or panels to be established.  Amendment No. 54 deals with the establishment of a youth advisory panel.  Senators Warfield, Carrigy, Cassells and I sat through the deliberations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.  We found the engagement with young people, their representatives and the schools very useful.  Many of the issues the new media commission will be engaging with will have an impact directly on young people and are of direct concern to young people.  Indeed, young people would be to the fore in adapting to new technologies.<\/p><p>Therefore, it is important that a very clear mechanism is found within the legislation to allow the commission to consult with young people and for this to be recognised at a statutory level.  We are proposing the establishment of a youth advisory panel with statutory recognition as part of the legislation.  It would be one of the standing committees of the commission and would have guaranteed youth representation.  Young people would attend to advise on the media codes that are being drawn up on the online safety practices and the programmes of digital media literacy that the media commission will roll out.  It does not preclude other forms of consultation with young people by the commission.  However, having this statutory committee would be a very useful way of interacting specifically with young people.  We would like to see it included so that there is statutory recognition within the legislation for a process of consultation such as this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#KK00400","speaker":"1638"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>I support the proposal.

Their biggest concern was that we, as legislators, did not get what was required in a sphere that was predominantly dominated by their age groups and that we were dictating to them what was best for them to keep them safe.  It was an education in itself to hear from them.  They recognised the Government was trying to do something positive not only for them but for all people.  One of their first points of contact when dealing with such an issue would be with the teachers in the school system and they were concerned teachers were not adept at dealing with the issues at play.  That was highly informative.  We nearly need to educate teachers about the pressures, dangers and aspects impacting on young people across a range of different areas.<br\/><br\/>That was replicated in a different discussion when we had a conversation about identity theft that resulted in sexually explicit material being used.  When the person concerned went to the Garda as their first point of contact, the garda&iacute; were not adept at dealing with the issues at play.  There were a range of areas where those who were the first points of contacts for people were not <i>au fait<\/i>with what was being dealt with.  We have gained insight through engaging with young people.  This amendment seeks to ensure that by having representatives of young people on the panel, it would be kept apprised of those issues as they evolve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#KK00600","speaker":"1641","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":107,"content":"<p>I want to speak briefly in support of this amendment.  It is not only good practice in this area in terms of the participation of youth in important decisions and decisions in areas that affect them, but it also has a strong practical purpose.  Young people identify much earlier than others the new trends and what is happening in society.  The Minister of State will be aware a number of our amendments, which we will deal with later, relate not only to harmful content online but harmful conduct online in terms of how vulnerable persons might be targeted by particular microtargeting.  A large number of the concerns of civil society about this Bill relate to young people, how they are targeted online, engage online, how their data are used and what kind of messaging is sent to them.  However, there is also an empowerment message.  This audiovisual directive is also about positive empowerment.  The general data protection regulation went some way towards this, the idea of people owning their own data, but similarly the spirit that people should feel empowered to help shape the online spaces, which we share and on which people spend so much of their time.<\/p> <p>A practical reason this panel is useful is in addressing other aspects of harmful behaviour.  Sadly, some of them only come to light through the courts system through which those with resources can vindicate, track down or pursue an issue to address a concern.  Young people often will not be in a position to have the resources to navigate either legally or bureaucratically, or even through political contact or connections in the world, a way to address their concerns.  There are not enough routes for young people to raise flags or raise their concerns to highlight issues.  It should not fall to individuals or, sadly, as we have seen so often, to families of young people after the fact talking about harmful behaviour or harmful content and how it affected the young person in their lives, sometimes with tragic effect.  Something like a youth advisory council is almost an early warning system whereby, separate from individual complaints, and we will discuss the individual complaint mechanism as the Bill evolves and it is crucial to its operation, there is a way for young people to talk, in practical effect, about what is happening, what are the trends and, if there are new regulations, what ways are being found around them.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is an early warning system, as well as a space for positive ideas for inclusion and empowerment.

It strikes me that the amendment is already quite reasonably worded.  It does not say that there must be a youth advisory panel for all eternity.  In the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, he mentioned a particular &ldquo;moment in time&rdquo;.  We are at a particular moment in time when a wide range of new actors are going to be regulated for the first time.  In that context, a youth advisory voice is important.  The amendment, as I understand it, simply says that within one year of its establishment, the commission would establish the committee.  It does not prescribe the issues that the committee would deal with.  It talks simply about &ldquo;issues of interest to children and young people, online safety, and on any other matters as the Commission may determine&rdquo;.  In fact, it is quite widely framed around the areas of examination.  There is not an intent to tie down the agenda of the commission fully.  It is left quite open.  It also does not say that the youth advisory panel would have to continue forever.  Rather, it says that it would be important to have a youth advisory panel, or a very close equivalent, in the first couple of years of this commission&rsquo;s operation and that it should be set up within that first year.<\/p> <p>I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s concern that sometimes a committee could be put in place and it would still be there in 20 years&rsquo; time.  However, that is not what this amendment seeks to mandate.  It simply says that it needs to happen early.  With respect, we heard the lengthy debate.  Even the online commissioner is only getting added in now.  Unless issues are put in legislation, they can become an afterthought.  We do not want in six years&rsquo; time for the commission to have to set up a youth advisory panel to let them know how they got it wrong.  This is about making sure the commission hits the ground running and makes decisions, policies and regulations that work from the beginning.  I think this is constructive.  I do not think it overly binds the Government or the commission.  We all expect that when we come back on Report Stage, we will be told it is the hope of the Minister that the commission might choose to establish a youth advisory panel.

In fact, when we talk about unduly tying the hands of the commission, we are creating a situation whereby a consultant who might be hired could effectively be in a position where he or she is inappropriately determining or shaping the policy of the commission.

Otherwise, consultants that have one contract with the commission and multiple more lucrative contracts with others are in a position where their advice or recommendations \"shall\" be strongly considered by the commission.  The commission \"shall\" have regard to it.  That is too onerous.  \"May\" is contained in a number of places in the Bill where I believe \"shall\" should be inserted because the latter carries more weight.

For that reason, it is appropriate in this case that, instead of a situation where the commission \"shall have regard to the advice of any consultant or adviser engaged under this section\", it \"may\" have regard to that advice.

Within this legislation, two forms of levy are discussed but they are not given different titles, <i>per se<\/i>.  They are both referred to as &quot;the levy&quot; or &quot;levy order&quot;.  A number of restrictions are placed in respect of the levies under this section, yet there are other levies relating to European works, for example, and I am not satisfied that there is enough clarity that the constraints on the commission's power to impose levies will not have a leakage effect as regards the European works levies.

Regarding amendment No. 60, the Bill reads:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(11) Any surplus of income, from levies imposed in respect of a levy period, over the expenses properly incurred by the Commission in that period and its working capital requirements in that period shall either--  \t(a) be retained by the Commission to be offset proportionately against subsequent levy obligations of the providers on whom the levy was imposed, or<br \/><br \/>(b) be refunded proportionately to those providers.  <\/blockquote> <p>This subsection is of concern.  There are some caveats to the earlier provisions, which refer to a levy's mandate under a particular subsection.  However, this subsection just refers to levy orders and the surplus of income from levies.  There is nothing wrong with any of that in itself, but I am concerned by its potential implications for section 159E.  Importantly, there is the possibility that the commission may make a levy order on service providers that will be used to fund European works.  In later amendments, we will deal with the kinds of work involved.  The levy order sets out the methods of calculation, periods involved, records, exemptions and so forth, but I am concerned that the constraints on levies in section 21 could muddy some of the planning of a levy under section 159E.<\/p><p>I have suggested a few removals and insertions to address the issue.  In one place, I propose: &quot;For the avoidance of doubt, this section shall not apply to levies issued under section 159E of the Principal Act and nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting such powers.&quot;<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=04\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I also have a corresponding equivalent amendment to insert into section 159E, but again, it is simply a clarification.  There are a few of the paragraphs within that section on levies, however, where it is not clear they are only speaking to the levies on the operation of the commission.  Perhaps the Minister of State could address that or some way could be found to clarify it.  As I said, I will put forward one proposal in terms of clarifying it but I am very happy if the Government has its own proposals in that manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#OO01000","speaker":"1662","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.  I understand the purpose of amendment No. 60 is to ensure there is sufficient distinction between the levy under the new section 21 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, which will be used to meet the expenses of the commission incurred in the course of discharging its regulatory functions set out in the Bill in the Broadcasting Act 2009, and the levy made under section 159E, as inserted by section 53 of the Bill, which will be used to fund any content production scheme established under section 159F.<\/p> <p>On the basis of my Department's engagement with the Office of the Attorney General, I believe there is sufficient distinction already provided through the legislation between the two levies, which is achieved in particular through the wording of sections 21(12) and 159E(8), which, when read together, clearly delineate where the Bill is referring to the industry levy or content production levy.<\/p> <p>The effect of amendments Nos. 57 and 58 would appear to be to remove the obligation on the commission to have regard to its expenses incurred in a given period when imposing the industry levy.  This could lead to the commission being unable to levy a higher amount from the industry than is needed to meet its operating costs.  This would be against the intention of the Bill to require regulated entities to fund the cost of their regulation.  The purpose of regulation as a general principle is to mitigate the negative impacts caused by these businesses as a matter of supporting the public good.  Providing an coimisi&uacute;n with unlimited revenue raising powers would not encourage efficiency and effectiveness in pursuit of this principle.  The new section 21(11) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, would still provide that any surplus would in any case be rolled into subsequent years to be offset against future levies or refunded to any providers levied.  This is in congress with the proposed amendment, which would lead to a lacuna in the legislation.  Accordingly, we do not propose to accept any of these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#PP00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I am a little concerned by that because I am looking to the language in subsections (1) and (2) referred to in section 21(12).  All that subsection (1) says is that:<\/p> <blockquote> \t(1) The Commission may make an order (a &lsquo;levy order&rsquo;) imposing a levy on any of the following:   \t(a) providers of audiovisual media services; <br \/><br \/>(b) providers of sound broadcasting services; <br \/><br \/>(c) providers of designated online services.  <\/blockquote> <p>All that subsection (2) says is that &quot;A levy order shall specify the period in respect of which a levy is imposed&quot;.  I do not see how that safeguards anything.  That is, in fact, quite wide.  It simply says a levy order relates to these kinds of actors, which are the actors covered by the Bill - that is nothing - and that a levy period is the period when the levy is imposed.<\/p><p>I do not, therefore, see how that is any insurance in terms of the concern I have about the levies in respect of European works.  I am concerned because, in fact, it is not the goal that the commission should only be making levies in respect of its operation.  As I understand it, the audiovisual directive also empowers a proactive making of levies on audiovisual media services and similar bodies that can then be channelled towards the production of European works.  Again, that is part of that obligation in terms of diversity of content and diversity of voice within our audiovisual landscape.<\/p><p>It certainly should not be the case that any scheme in relation to European works is simply a kind of small subfunction of the commission's operation.  It is, in fact, a power that goes beyond operational costs.  It is something that represents instead a proactive role.  As the Minister of State described it, again, that is the part that is getting focused on.  I have not heard something that addresses my concern in terms of really being assured this commission will be able, for example, to say it wishes to put a 2% or 5% levy or whatever it might be on audiovisual services which it wants to be channelled into all of those more diverse forms of cultural participation and product such as are set out in the scheme for European works under section 159F.<\/p><p>I would accept that subsection (5) has some caveats in terms of &quot;calculating the amount of a levy under any paragraph of subsection (1)&quot;.  Subsection (5) has some caveats but, say, something like subsection (11) around the surplus of income and subsections (1) and (2), which were referred to by the Attorney General, do not distinguish that the constraints in this section shall apply only in respect of the operational costs and levies in terms of operational costs.  I have not heard, in fact, an argument as to how these will not constrain levies in respect of the European works.  I listened, and apologies if there is something I missed in the answer, but the answer as I heard it, however, kind of looped around itself in that it referred right back to this section.<\/p><p>As I said, I see some language in subsection (5) that seems potentially useful in terms of constraint, but again, the provisions in terms of subsection (11) simply just say a &quot;levy period&quot;.  The levy period is simply the period in which a levy is imposed.  It does not say a levy in respect of the workings of the commission or a levy in respect of operations.  I am sorry to labour this but I am excited about the positive potential of this legislation as well as the protective and promotional role.  I just do not see it.  Again, perhaps I need to have it outlined clearly to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#PP00300","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Higgins.

Amendment No. 61 would delete a reference specifying that an coimisi&uacute;n can borrow in a currency other than the currency of the State but this is a standard provision for State bodies.  Accordingly, I do not propose to change the drafting approach taken to avoid any unintended consequences.<\/p> <p>Similarly, amendment No. 62 represents a departure from the standard provisions regarding the authorisation of borrowing by State bodies.  It is right that bodies require not only the approval of the relevant Minister but also the consent of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform, and Finance.  The consent provisions are necessary because any borrowing by State bodies such as the commission will add to our general Government debt and affect our compliance with EU fiscal rules.  While I am, as a principle, usually in favour of more Oireachtas oversight, I believe that public bodies should be accountable to the Oireachtas rather than being subject to prior authorisation by the Oireachtas for each decision they take.  This amendment cannot be accepted because it would be a departure from the standard practice, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Finance being required to consult and seek the views of the relevant Oireachtas joint committee for a matter of this nature.  There are sufficient safeguards in the Bill's provisions to mitigate the risk of any excessive borrowings by the commission.  There are also practical considerations such as the fact that committees fall on the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and might, therefore, not be available in the event of urgent matters needing to be resolved.<\/p> <p>Amendment No. 63 requires that the commission may borrow only from institutions authorised by the Central Bank.  This amendment would appear to be at variance with EU law.  Under EU directive 2013\/36\/EU, financial institutions authorised in other member states of the EEA may carry on business in the State without receiving further authorisation from the Central Bank.<\/p> <p>I also have concerns regarding both the practical implications and the EU law implications of amendment No. 64.  The issuance of broadcasting contracts is a core part of the means by which the commission will regulate broadcasting services such as linear television services.  In requiring the commission to seek the approval of the Oireachtas regarding matters pertaining to the awarding of broadcasting contracts, this amendment would appear to be contrary to the provisions of Article 30 of the audiovisual media services directive, which provides that member states shall ensure that regulatory bodies are functioning independently of their respective governments or of any other public or private body.  In addition to this, requiring Oireachtas approval for every deposit made by an applicant for a broadcasting contract with an coimisi&uacute;n would be both impractical and cumbersome.  At present and in most instances, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland requires deposits to be made when an applicant for a broadcasting contract submits a statement of intent to the authority in respect of an open licensing period being run by the authority.  The sums of money involved are small and the process is designed to encourage quality in submissions to the authority and to avoid frivolous submissions.

We may well be in a period of time where there is much more digital use of existing currencies and transfers.

Ireland is gearing up to have large-scale data centres.  I know from sitting on the Joint Oireachtas Committees on Finance, and Environment and Climate Action that there are those who would like to see Ireland becoming a hub in respect of things like cryptocurrencies but that comes with extraordinary levels of risk.

It provides that when preparing a strategy statement, as well as submitting it to the Minister, the commission would also share it with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 66 inserts a new subsection.  Again, these are core things when setting out the strategy.  These are not day-to-day but rather three-year strategy periods and broad strategy statements for three-year periods.  This amendment provides that when preparing these strategy statements, the commission would consult the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, Screen Ireland, which is an important voice in this respect, and any other persons or bodies the commission considers appropriate.  In setting out its strategy for each three-year period, each of these bodies has a very specific expertise that is of value and of use to the commission in its work.<\/p><p>Due to the fact there is a remit of equality and human rights and a specific remit in terms of inclusion and participation for the media commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission obviously offers a useful input in that regard.  Due to the fact there are provisions in its operation that relate to areas of data protection, data management and privacy, the Data Protection Commission has an expertise.  For example, we know that one of the areas that is being much discussed in terms of harmful conduct and content is how special categories of personal data are used to create microprofiles and enable microtargeting.<\/p><p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media also has a particular role.  Regarding this amendment, I am open to having the committee mentioned separately because I am conscious the others in this list are public bodies.  Therefore, if it is felt appropriate to accept those bodies but not the joint committee, I am happy to put forward a revised version of this amendment on Report Stage.<\/p><p>Screen Ireland is something that will represent the audiovisual sector in terms of that kind of positive content role, which is part of the role of the new media commission and part of the remit of the audiovisual directive.  It would help to address the issue of Irish-related content and generate assurance that we have a plurality and diversity of content represented in our online media provider spaces.  Each of those would add something very concrete to the development of strategy, and none of them is prescriptive or requires sign-off.  It simply requires and suggests the commission would consult them.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 67 is an alternative to amendment No. 65.  It just words it in a slightly separate way to say that when preparing the strategy statement, it should consult the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  It may be that I may submit in future iterations a version of amendment No. 66 that does not include the committee and lists the committee in a separate amendment.<\/p><p>The Bill at the moment allows for the commission to consult persons under subsection (4).  Amendment No. 68 simply states that where it consults such persons as it considers appropriate, a record of such consultation should be kept, deposited with the Minister and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The key point here in terms is not so much where they should be deposited or laid but that the record should be kept.  For example, if the commission is engaging in consultation with large online media service providers in the development of a strategy, it would be very important that there would be a record of that.  If one of the major media companies that may be affected by the regulations in the strategy has a meeting with the commission around the development of the strategy, it would of course be very important that would be recorded.  Again, this is addressing some of the concerns there have been.  There is a perception of very big and wealthy media actors and online media actors being in a position where they have had quite a high level of access and meeting in terms of political decision-making.  It would be very important it would be clear exactly what their engagement might be in relation to the commission&rsquo;s strategy and actions.<\/p><p>I apologise for being quite lengthy.  My last amendment in this grouping is amendment No. 69.  I suggest a slightly different wording because, as it stands, the Bill reads, in relation to the commission's operations, that, &ldquo;The Commission shall, in preparing each strategy statement and each work programme, have regard to the need to ensure the most economical and efficient use of its resources.&rdquo;  I am worried this directs the commission towards a minimalist approach.  &ldquo;The most economical and efficient use of its resources&rdquo; could direct it towards a position whereby a light-touch regulation approach becomes the most economical and efficient way to approach an issue.  What might be &quot;economical&quot; and might even be &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; in the classic sense of the word , that it is quicker and shorter, is not necessarily the most effective.  They are different things.  Efficiency and effectiveness are not the exact same thing.  The absolute priority of the commission, surely, in its operation and strategies should be that it is effective.  I am concerned that &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo;, in terms of minimising what it does, and &ldquo;economy&rdquo;, in terms of spending as little as possible, could lead to a commission that only does the absolute minimum rather than that ambitious role we hope it will play.  We have seen that the under-resourcing of the Data Protection Commission had very negative impacts in terms of Ireland reputationally.  Similarly, if we have a minimalist approach to the operation of a new media commission, where Ireland will be one of the major regulators, that will also reflect very poorly on us and will have consequences down the line.<\/p><p>I suggest the wording &ldquo;sustainable and efficient use of its resources, while ensuring that such resources are directed towards maximum social and cultural benefit to the public&rdquo;.  However, I am happy to come back with another single-word amendment to add the word &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.  Perhaps my version of amendment No. 69 might be a little bit too visionary around what we would hope for around this maximum cultural and social benefit to the public.  I am conscious that is quite interpretable.  Perhaps I will bring in an amendment on Report Stage that simply says &ldquo;economic, efficient and effective&rdquo;, or perhaps, the Government may bring such an amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#TT00500","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I note amendments Nos. 65 and 67 where they specifically reference reports and discussions with the Oireachtas joint committee.

I recognise the intention of amendment No. 65.  Section 29(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 currently provides that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland shall present a copy of the strategy statement to the Minister and to such committees of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas as the Minister may, from time to time, direct.  I propose that the language could be introduced on Report Stage to achieve the intended affect of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment.  As the names of Oireachtas committees tend to change following general elections, it is not best practice to use the current names of committees in such references, but instead to refer to the committee whose functions relate to the functions of the Act in question.  This is provided for in the Bill by way of an amendment to the definition of Oireachtas joint committee in the 2009 Act.  I would be concerned that amendments Nos. 66 and 67 would unduly circumscribe the independence of the commission in determining whom it should consult when preparing the statement of strategy.  I believe it is sufficient to allow an coimisi&uacute;n to determine the effective mode of consultation and the number of consultees.  For that reason, the Minister will not be accepting amendments Nos. 66 and 67.<\/p> <p>I do not see the value of the proposed approach in amendment No. 68.  We are not proposing to accept it.  It is not usual practice to lay internal records of processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas nor for the Oireachtas Library services to store such materials.<\/p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, will not be accepting amendment No. 69.  The language used in the Bill, which requires the commission to have regard to the need to ensure the most economical and efficient use of its resources, is appropriate.  The language reflects long-standing principles with regard to the importance of value for money in the use of resources and can be found for example in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  Further to this, an coimisi&uacute;n is already obliged in section 7 of the 2009 Act, as inserted by section 3 of this Bill, to exercise its functions which exist for the purpose of the public good to further support, promote and safeguard the public good.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#UU00200","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":215,"content":"<p> Senator Higgins moved amendment No. 65.

I accept that the title of the relevant committee may change at a certain point.  However, it is important that there would be that parliamentary oversight or engagement in terms of the strategy and not solely Executive or Government engagement.  I welcome the fact that there would be engagement with the relevant committees.<\/p> <p>In regard to the issue of IHREC, the Data Protection Commission and others, as this Bill moves towards Report Stage the human rights and equality duty will be really important.  We had other amendments in regard to this earlier.  We had some indication that the Minister was looking to them.  The duty which all public bodies have in regard to human rights and equality is somewhat greater in the case of this body.  It must not simply be a minimalist approach.  I believe it should be very liberally interpreted.  All public bodies have an obligation to promote human rights and equality actively, but this commission has more than that - coming from the audiovisual directive, it also has a specific charge in relation to inclusion, equality and participation.  Those are core policy goals of the audiovisual directives which this legislation is supposed to be transposing and giving effect to in Irish law.  It may not be in this section, but it is important that there is a really specific acknowledgement of that area of human rights and equality and the goals and obligations in that respect.  We discussed that earlier in regard to certain other aspects of the operation of the commission.  I may bring another amendment which simply reaffirms that those matters must be given due regard in the development of the strategy, separate from the question of with whom it consults in regard to those obligations.  Thematically, those are core points.<\/p> <p>In regard to amendment No. 68, the key issue is not simply the laying before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That can go by the wayside.  The extremely important point is that a record would be kept.  I note that we have had similar amendments put forward in regard to a number of areas of the Government&rsquo;s operation, including in regard to planning, climate legislation and other areas where we have simply required that a record would be kept in regard to consultations.  That is an absolute minimum in terms of transparency.  We know that the decisions that the media commission in Ireland makes will have extremely significant ramifications for extraordinarily wealthy companies which have massive lobbying architecture.  We need to be frank about that.  There is no point in acting as though that is by the by.  That is the reality.  In that context for the public, not just in Ireland but also across the European Union, where in many cases regulatory decisions made in Ireland will have an impact, it is really important that there is clear transparency in regard to whom the commission meets with.  That does not impact on its independence but it does mean it will be doing its job in a way that is properly accountable.  The question of laying something before both Houses of the Oireachtas or depositing it with them can be left by the wayside, but the core point is that records must be kept in regard to with whom the commission meets when developing its strategy.  I will be come back to this and press for it quite strongly on Report Stage.  I hope that the Government may bring its own amendments. <\/p> <p>I accept that the language in regard to the public good is there at the beginning, but the public good can be delivered in a minimalist or a maximalist way.  It is not always sufficient to refer to &ldquo;the most economical and efficient use of resources&rdquo;.  The question of the most economical, efficient and effective use of resources is a core one.  If the commission wishes to explore a potential new area of regulation - for example, if a practice that is developing gets flagged by a youth panel as something to be followed up and investigated further - we do not want to indicate that it is effectively tied by telling it that it needs to be as economical as possible by doing the minimum and keeping its margins narrow.  There is a danger in how it is framed at the moment.  I accept that the Minister might not want to accept my wording in amendment No. 69.  I am not going to press that.  However I would ask that the phrasing in section 29(8) be re-examined, that the potential risks of the \"economical and efficient\" phrasing be looked at and that a phrase such as &ldquo;economical, efficient and effective&rdquo; be addressed.

I will not be accepting amendment No. 71.  The purpose of section 30 is to provide legislative underpinning for the Minister to direct an coimisi&uacute;n to provide observations on legislative proposals, to undertake a review of the operation or intended operation of an enactment or to make a proposal of its own volition regarding a legislative measure.  This will be a useful provision in light of the type of future legislation that may be required to take account of societal or technological changes as it would enable an coimisi&uacute;n to be proactive and to make timely observations and proposals to Ministers.  In this context, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, does not believe there is a requirement to lay records of consultations undertaken with any person to comply with a ministerial direction to provide observations.  It is not usual practice to lay internal records of the processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas or for the Oireachtas Library to store such materials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#VV01600","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>I would like clarification.  A similar answer was given in terms of the earlier piece when the focus was laid on the phrase \"laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas\".  I have made it clear that that is not the core point.  Does the Minister agree that records in regard to with whom the commission consults should be kept?  I am speaking about those with whom the commission consults in the general sense and also specifically with whom it is consulting in regard to the advice it may give in regard to legislation which will potentially have a significant impact.  The question of whether those records are laid and who they might be laid before is only one part of it.  The core issue here is the principle that records of consultations should be kept and that there should be a note in that regard.<\/p> <p>I do not like to name companies and I do not want to do so in respect of the Chamber, but there are companies who we know may have a very strong interest in regard to legislation that may come through Ireland and on which a Minister may seek advice from the commission.  If the commission is meeting with a company who may be affected by legislation, which company may be giving advice to the Minister in respect of that legislation, it is appropriate and important that a record would be kept of that and that the public would be able to be aware of it.  That is core to public confidence in the commission.  The public must be confident that the Minister in receiving the advice of the commission is not influenced in a way that it is not aware of.  I do not want to impugn the intentions of the commission or how it operates but it is important that it be transparent and be seen to be transparent and that there be clear records of how it does its work.  That is part of the public confidence piece.  <\/p> <p>Leaving aside the question of what may be laid in the Oireachtas Library, is the question of the keeping of records in regard to with whom the commission consults at least a point that the Government recognises as being appropriate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022050400002#VV01700","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1651669200,"counter":237,"content":"<p>I can only respond to the substance of the amendment and what the consequences of accepting it would be.
