I reassure her that we are on track, progressing and going through the stages.  As the Senator has rightly outlined, funding of &euro;100 million was allocated, so we intend to make sure that money is spent and that the hole in the ground is filled as soon as possible.  I was down near the site only recently and could see it.  I imagine those who are looking at it all the time are wondering if it will ever happen, but I reassure Senator Clifford-Lee that it is very much still a priority and we want to make sure this happens.<\/p> <p>Construction of a purpose-built family law court complex at Hammond Lane is a key project in the National Development Plan 2021-2030, as I have just mentioned.  It is envisaged this will be part of the overall public private partnership, PPP, justice sector project, which, as the Senator and other colleagues are probably aware, will also see the construction of two new Garda stations in Clonmel and Macroom.  The complex will be built with the specific needs of family law users in mind, and the intention is that it will provide the modern facility where family law cases can be held in a much more dignified, secure and non-threatening environment with all the range of support services at hand.  It will replace the present inadequate and fragmented facility for family law which is stretched across central Dublin at Dolphin House, Chancery Street, Phoenix House and in the Four Courts.  Again, I was in Dolphin House not that long ago and, as Senator Clifford-Lee rightly said, the seating arrangements, where people are on top of each other and there is no space, and the fact there are no separate rooms is not adequate, particularly when dealing with such difficult and often traumatic and complex situations and where children are involved and space is needed to be able to support them.<\/p> <p>Following approval by the courts board, the Courts Service submitted a final preliminary business case.  The Department of Justice, as the approving authority under the public spending code, provided approval in principle to the Courts Service and to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the other two projects in June 2022 and to proceed with the project under that particular PPP mechanism.  Formal project structures are being established with the various stakeholders, including the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, to progress the project as quickly as possible.  This is subject to detailed planning and design work, which is currently being undertaken by the OPW architectural services.  It is being informed by consultations undertaken with the relevant stakeholders operating in the area of family law, legislative developments and outputs from family law modernisation initiatives.  There is a lot of engagement happening now to make sure the design is as it needs to be and, because it started some years ago, it is as up to date as possible and, essentially, will work in parallel with the developments that are happening at a legislative basis and in terms of our family law justice plan.  Once design work is complete, the Part 9 planning process will begin.<\/p> <p>I am determined to overhaul the operation of the family justice system to ensure we have a more efficient and user-friendly family court that puts families and children in particular at the centre of its work.  This is a key commitment in my justice plan .  We have a commitment to enact the family court Bill.  This is to create a dedicated family court within the existing court structure to provide for court procedures that support a faster but also less adversarial resolution of disputes.  The purpose of the legislation is the establishment of the dedicated family court, to improve levels of judicial expertise and training in family law matters, and to streamline family law proceedings, thereby making them more user-friendly and less costly.  The general scheme of the family court Bill is with the office of Parliamentary Counsel at the moment and drafting is in progress.  I very much hope to have it brought to Cabinet and to be able to publish it in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>Once the design stage is approved, the project will go to planning, and once planning is approved, it will then go to make sure we have the right costings, after which it will go to tender.  All of those stages are moving along.  As I said, we have approved to the most recent stage in June.  I hope we will have the design finalised by the end of this year.  We can then go to planning where there is obviously a timeline in place that I cannot necessarily predict, but once the planning process starts, there is a set timeline where people can object and we have to go through all of that.  Once that happens, then the costing is approved.  We are moving in the right trajectory.  It is just making sure we can, and I am keeping the pressure on so that continues as quickly as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#B00200","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Cathain a bheidh dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta ar an su&iacute;omh sin?

This is a Commencement matter on education addressed to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  I hope the Minister of State can relay my messages back to her.  We need more psychologists in the HSE.  We need them working in schools, in primary care, in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and on our children's disability network teams.  I very much welcome the decision to pilot in-house mental health counselling for primary school pupils, amounting to &euro;5 million in the budget.  It is something for which I had called.  We need it in our secondary schools too.<\/p> <p>I am asking the Minister, through the  Minister of State, who they are going to employ to take on these roles.  There are 9,500 children waiting on primary care psychology services - an overwhelming number.  Without early intervention, mild mental health issues grow, leading to bigger problems.  This can be avoided with the right support and treatment.  There are not enough psychologists in our children's disability network teams for our special schools.  We do not have enough national educational psychologists in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or therapists in mainstream or special classes.  It is acutely felt by children with autism and special needs and by their families.  That is the situation at the moment before we also start to recruit for general mental health support in schools, which as I said is very positive.<\/p> <p>I mention also that there is no mandatory training for teachers for autism in mainstream classrooms to ensure teachers are equipped to respond to the needs of children as well.  It is great we are launching pilot programmes like this, that we have committed to reinstating therapists in special schools, and that we are opening buildings in our communities for children's disability network teams, CDNTs.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is great that money was allocated in the budget that we have never seen before but if we are not fixing the problem of actual recruitment and places, then we are prolonging the problem and the pain for families.  Something the Government and the Department of Education have done in this budget, to address some of the inequity around trainee psychologist doctorate programmes, was to enable counselling psychologists to access the same amount of funding and the same salary as clinical psychologists.  That is good news, but educational psychologists have been left out.  Why have they been left out?<\/p><p>I will give some figures I received from somebody who wrote to me this week and I have been dealing with this issue for a long time now.  This is someone who is doing the education and child psychology doctorate at Mary Immaculate College.  She has already spent &euro;30,000 training to get to this point in her career.  She is paying &euro;10,000 in fees and is working for 330 days unpaid.  Her counterpart in the clinical psychologist course gets a salary of &euro;40,497 and 60% of her fees are covered.  As part of their doctorates, these people will be based in the HSE's children's disability services, in the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and in the primary care psychology service.  Post-qualification they will be qualified to work in any of those areas.  Why do they not have access to the same funding to pay the extortionate cost when they dedicate their lives to children and educational psychology?  Not only do they deserve to be paid the same, they need to be valued for what they are doing and that is part of the reason they will work in the HSE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#B01100","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has four minutes to respond to the Senator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#C00200","speaker":"1643"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I was aware of this issue.  I had been in correspondence with a constituent about it.  It seems to be an anomaly.  I will give the Minister's response now, but I agree the support they provide to schools and CAMHS and critical incident support in schools is a hugely valued resource for our schools.  I am taking the Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, who sends her apologies for being unable to be here this morning.<\/p> <p>The Department's National Educational Service, NEPS, provides educational and psychological support to all recognised primary and post-primary schools.  This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident; access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students; access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries; and access to individual pupil casework, where there is a need, via a NEPS psychologist or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments.<\/p> <p>NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service that focuses on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem-solving and solution-oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum-based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage of the process.  Where reasonable progress is not made following a school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, a psychologist will become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.<\/p> <p>In 2021 the NEPS casework service extended to more than 8,500 students.  In addition, private psychologists provided assessment to schools for more than 900 students under the scheme for commissioning psychological assessment process.  The NEPS support and development service reaches an estimated 25,000 teachers annually.  The number of NEPS sanctioned psychologists have increased from an employment control framework base of 173 whole-time equivalent psychologist posts in 2014.  Budgets 2017, 2018 and 2019 sanctioned an additional 31 posts in total.  As part of a package of measures to support the well-being of school communities as schools re-opened following post-Covid-19 closures, an additional 17 psychologist posts were sanctioned.  During the 2019-2020 academic year, temporary project posts were sanctioned: four for the school-inclusion model and three for the North East Inner City project.<\/p> <p>The NEPS is led by a director supported by regional directors and senior psychologists.  Currently, in the region of 225 whole-time equivalent educational psychologists deliver an excellent service to our schools.  The Minister recently announced an additional 54 educational psychologists to provide services to special schools and special classes as part of budget 2023.  The Department values the work of all educational psychologists across the education system and, as the Senator is likely aware, the NEPS of the Department provides a comprehensive school-based psychological service to all primary and post-primary schools through the application of psychological theory and practice to support well-being, academic,social and emotional development of all learners.  NEPS provides this service to schools through casework with individual children and support and development work for schools.<\/p> <p>The Department is conscious of the challenges in recruiting educational psychologists and has established a high-level working group, chaired by the secretary general of the Department to consider how best to support educational psychologists and ensure a sufficient supply of psychologists is available to the education sector.<\/p> <p>Both the Department and the Minister are aware of the issue of fees for trainee educational psychologists and are working proactively and intensively to find a positive resolution for the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#C00300","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":24,"content":"<p>The last paragraph is my update.  I welcome the high-level working group to look at this in the round, but the issue of fees is urgent and it needs to be addressed as soon as possible for equity and for these people to feel valued.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that back to the Ministers if he can.<\/p> <p>Something else that has come to my attention is the good news that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, announced that therapists would be reinstated in special schools and our special school in Dublin 15, Danu, has been told of its allocation which includes a behavioural therapist we have needed and wanted for a long time.  However, I have now heard F&oacute;rsa has stepped in because the CDNTs have been directed to provide their most senior therapists, but we are all swimming out of the same pool.  How do they do that and do all of the work they have in their CDNTs as well?  We have an problem here and that also needs to be addressed.

I think it stemmed from the deliberations of the Acting Chairperson's party Ard Fheis at the weekend.  A lot of media coverage was dedicated to it and to the Minister's intentions over the weekend.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand, again from reading media reports, that this was discussed.  I welcome that decision, if it has been made.  I certainly welcome that we are having a conversation about it and the direction of policy.  As the Minister of State knows, a failed policy was established in 2018.  While there has been some commentary about the previous Minister, which I will not get into, I remind the current Minister and the current regime that this policy has continued to today.  This Government is now, at almost two and a half years, nearly at the mid-point of its term.  It has continued the policy it is now saying needs to be changed and that there needs to be a better system.  It is better late than never when it comes to the change, but it is important we do not lose sight of that fact.<\/p><p>The BTR rules were introduced by the Minister's predecessor in 2018 and, as I said, continue to be in place today.  It means that apartments owned by institutional investors and developers, specifically for the rental market, do not have to comply with the minimum size standards required for homes for sale.  That is the subtle difference, especially as regards floor space but also storage, which is a particular challenge.  We now have a surplus of some of these units, many of which have been improved through planning, either by the planning authority or through An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but have not been developed, despite a housing crisis.  We have something in the system that has been approved and yet we have the task of housing.  This measure is pragmatic and I generally welcome the idea and concept behind it.  As I said, I know this was discussed at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis and was reported widely in the media and through television commentary.<\/p><p>I would like to ask the Minister of State a few questions.  If we do not have the detail today, we can follow up with a supplementary question, if that is okay with him.  When will the Government seek to amend the existing guidelines and changes that have been discussed?  Will it be the case that developers already in the planning process or that have been granted planning permission will be allowed to continue under the existing regime?  While I see some logic and understanding for building out, and under the current regime we have to have some sort of planning, we need an end game.  There has to be a cut-off point where the regime has to end, if that is Government policy.  No doubt, we will discuss that at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and other forums within this House.  Will converting existing BTR planning permissions into conventional standard units - homes - especially in the area of affordable and social housing, be considered?<\/p><p>I am delighted the Minister of State is present rather than the Minister.  I prepared this Commencement for the Minister, which included asking him whether he could share with me his Government partner's view on this policy.  Now the Minister of State is in the hot seat, which is great, and I am interested in his party's policy.  I am particularly interested in Fine Gael's view on it.  If he cannot address all those details today, I ask him to follow them up.<\/p><p>Generally, I welcome this reform.  It makes absolute sense.  We have to be pragmatic.  No policy stays static; it has to be reviewed.  This is a particularly good reform, albeit late.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#C00800","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will immediately impart our own views.

Specifically in response to the question posed, the section 28 guidelines, Sustainable Urban Housing: Design Standards for New Apartments - Guidelines for Planning Authorities, published in 2018 and updated in 2020, identified BTR as a specific type of residential development for planning purposes, with some variation in resident support and amenity requirements, and dwelling mix and design standards, relative to apartments generally.  These differences are set out in specific planning policy requirements, SPPRs, 7 and 8 in the apartment guidelines.  In carrying out their planning functions, which include formulating development plans and assessing planning applications, planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act and must comply with any SPPRs contained within such guidelines.<\/p> <p>Strategic housing development, SHD, permissions made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la show that, as of July 2022, the board had granted permission for 50,792 apartments, of which 12,230 were specifically BTR units at the time of permission.  Of the 12,230 approved BTR units, 2,669, or 22%, have commenced on site and 9,561, or 78%, have not started.  Given current site activation challenges and construction costs, this time-lag is to be expected.  However, the figures serve to demonstrate that a significant quantum of BTR units have been permitted through the SHD process and remain outstanding.<\/p> <p>In summary, despite an uncertain economic outlook and a reduction in activity in 2022, it is clear that, since 2018, the BTR market has become established and that there are a large number of outstanding planning permissions.  Given the quantum of development delivered and permitted to date, there is no longer a planning rationale to retain BTR as a separate development type subject to more flexible design standards.  This may be achieved by amending the section 28 apartment guidelines to remove the specific requirement that BTR is identified as a separately defined type of development with specific design standards.  This amendment to the apartment guidelines would not preclude future BTR development.  It would simply remove the need to describe BTR as a distinct class of development for planning purposes and require the standards for BTR development to be the same as those for all other permitted apartment developments.<\/p> <p>It is important there would be a transition period whereby BTR proposals currently in the planning system, whether SHD or otherwise, or on which significant work has progressed and are about to enter the planning system can be progressed to a planning decision based on the transitional arrangements that will apply.  It is therefore considered reasonable that amended apartment guidelines that delete SPPRs 7 and 8 would be issued before the end of 2022.<\/p> <p>Again, I hope this gives some clarity to some of the questions.  If we can come back on the other specific questions, I will get the Department to respond to the Senator directly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#D00700","speaker":"1512"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":36,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

She was a lovely, vivacious young woman with two children.  Sadly, her life was taken from her in April last year.  This should not have happened.  On Saturday, her brother, Jason, joined Deputy Jim O'Callaghan and me to talk about the horrific trauma that his family suffered when Jennifer's life was taken from her in seven minutes by a former partner who was known for domestic violence.  The main reason that we had this conversation was to try to ensure that a register of domestic abuse offenders would be set up.  Jennifer had the courage and conviction to finish the relationship.  Many people are not able to finish a relationship but Jennifer was.  Afterwards, the fact that he had been in jail for two and a half years for a previous domestic violence offence came out.  If there was a domestic violence register in the same way that there is a sexual abusers register, there is no doubt that the garda&iacute; and Jennifer would have been aware, and she would not have got into that situation.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has suggested that a domestic violence register be opened in this country.  I think it would be important.  I ask the Deputy Leader to see if the Minister for Justice will come in so we can have a debate on that in this House.<\/p> <p>I want to raise an issue regarding the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  The new system opened on 3 October to facilitate people who were adopted.  They can provide their information to try to ensure that they can trace their parents.  More than 400 applications were made on Monday.  It has been a long, difficult and emotional road for many people.  I pay tribute to the tireless advocates and to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for delivering on this commitment.  Since Monday, adopted people, those who were boarded out or had their birth illegally registered have been able to apply for full information about their birth or early lives.  It is anticipated that up to 150,000 people will be able to access their full information.  It is important that we ask for this to be done in a timely fashion.  In six months, we should ask the Minister to come to the House to give information about the statistics at that point.<\/p> <p>I congratulate two men on what they have achieved.

However, there is a serious aspect, of concern within these Houses, that needs to be addressed and answered.  Deputies and Senators, by virtue of their jobs, have access to delicate, private material.  We have all been asked to advocate for people and their families.  In the process, we are given material that discloses delicate, private matters and vulnerability.  With Members and their staff having access to such information from members of the public, it is important for us to have robust systems to ensure the presumption of innocence is safeguarded at all times and that natural justice and fair procedures are accorded to the individual.  Deputies and Senators have a duty to act to safeguard the public and their staff.<\/p><p>I ask the Deputy Leader to establish whether the individual in question has been suspended on full pay, pending the outcome of this investigation.  What is the position and stance of that individual and the Deputy&rsquo;s party on this matter?  Has the party afforded support?  How is the public being safeguarded?  We are dealing with potentially serious child protection issues.  It is important that Members of this House and the party of the individual have acted properly with regard to these issues.<\/p><p>Yesterday, during the Order of Business, a Member of this House tried to provide cover for incredibly ignorant statements made about people.  Comments were made about parents of children born via surrogacy.  Those comments are on the record of this House.  The parents were reduced to being people who engage in contracts.  That Member made a cynical attempt to claim that they were being criticised as being far right after saying something and says that the Member is just raising an objection.  Nobody objects to anybody having a different opinion or to the advocacy of a different opinion.  That is correct.  I object to the labelling and prejudicing of individuals and the reducing of Travellers and people who advocate on behalf of Black Lives Matter.  The language that we use is incredibly important.  Having empathy for people in their situation is important, even if one disagrees with their point of view.  Reducing the situation and cynically seeking cover in this House by saying that it does not matter how ignorant or aggressive statements are, and that people objecting to that person saying it are labelling him or her as far right, is not true and should be challenged on every occasion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#G00500","speaker":"1682","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":51,"content":"<p>We had interesting statements last night on the high-level action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.

I was made to feel welcome and at home there.  Senator O'Loughlin has been a great mentor and colleague since I arrived here, as has everybody in this House.

The Minister indicated in his response that he had little time and would like to come back to the House again.  There were a couple of issues that I would like to revisit if we can facilitate the Minister&rsquo;s return.  I was struck by the comments that Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin made about the Reserve Defence Force.  During my time in the Defence Forces, we interacted with the Reserve Defence Force, which was then known as F&oacute;rsa Cosanta &Aacute;iti&uacute;il, the FCA.  It had high-calibre people, including businesspeople and public servants.  They had a wealth of industrial and professional experience.  The military does everything that is done in society and replicates it, from logistics to nursing to dentistry.  It is a huge human capital resource.  We are confronted by many challenges.  Under the European Union Petersberg Tasks, the priorities for our military are to address man-made and natural disasters.  There is significant potential for our Defence Forces, particularly for the Reserve Defence Force, to be mobilised to aid the civil authority.  I have it from no less an authoritative source than <i>The Sun<\/i>that there is a triple-dip La Ni&ntilde;a in the Pacific, which means there is a possibility of a repeat of the great freeze of 2010, the Beast from the East and so on.  Our military personnel come to the fore in such situations.<\/p><p>With regard to other challenges, the Minister mentioned the defence academy.  Throughout Covid, members of the medical profession publicly advised the Government.  We did not have civil servants from the Department of Health doing so.  It is high time that we find a mechanism or platform for senior members of our military to publicly advise the Government.  There should be some platform, as in other jurisdictions in Europe, to give advice on the many challenges that confront us, from the destabilisation caused by the conflict in Ukraine to climate change and other issues coming down the tracks.  That will bolster the intellectual tradition of our forces, which is nascent.

Our Cathaoirleach contributed.  It was an interesting, diverse and worthwhile discussion.  I am not just saying this but genuinely thought the most powerful part of the day were the contributions from the Rev. Karen Sethuraman and Ben Collins.  They both come from the unionist tradition and both gave thoughtful, open and honest contributions to the debate on our constitutional future and change for the better for all of us.  That chimed well with the event we held in this Chamber on Friday with the Seanad Public Consultation Committee.  While I think I said this already, I want to say it again, the morning session of that debate involving the young people was particularly worthwhile.  I know Fridays are busy, but if colleagues get the opportunity, they should try to come in over the next couple of weeks to listen to the voices of young people.  If it is anything like last Friday, it is an important, powerful part of the work of that committee.  I look forward to more of that.  It shows how important the debate is.<\/p> <p>It is apt that the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords will be with us this afternoon.  I know the Deputy Leader will have an interest in the change in tone from the British Government.  I hope it is representative of the real need to return to a positive negotiation of issues regarding the protocol and to return to the core principles of protecting the Good Friday Agreement.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We have heard some very negative sabre-rattling from the DUP over the past couple of days, from people who have always opposed the Good Friday Agreement.

In 2018, the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, said this would be a flagship cost rental project in the city, with loans from the European Investment Bank, EIB, and funds from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to provide, on what was a social housing site, 70% cost rental and 30% social housing.  It has always been understood that that site would be 100% public and affordable housing.<\/p> <p>Last week, at the last minute, just before the planning application went in, Dublin City Council informed Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum, which is chaired very ably by Eamon Devoy and which includes councillors, local residents and members of the St. Michael's Estate Regeneration Board, that there was potential for 91 units to be sold on to a private developer as part of a development with the shopping centre and that was how it would fund the community facilities that need to go into a development that will 467 homes and might have a population of 1,000.  That was never the understanding of anyone involved in the project in the last four years and is very concerning.  I have raised the matter a couple of times in the House of how local authorities are in a stranglehold because there is no separate income stream for community facilities.  For instance there is another regeneration project just down the road in St. Teresa's Gardens.  I fought very hard for a pitch there when I was on Dublin City Council.  In order to get this we needed to sell on a parcel of land.  This arose again with the development of O'Devaney Gardens.  Any community facilities need to be paid for.  Dublin City Council, councillors and members of the community feel like they are forced to sell land in order to be able to pay for them.  If we are doing flagship projects such as this it should be taken for granted that there will be funding for things like playgrounds, green spaces and things like community centres.  That is an essential part of a working community.  That this was landed on the people who worked so hard, like John Bissett, Rita Fagan and Eilish Comerford, who have been working on this for the last 20 years a week before planning was about to be submitted is a disgraceful treatment of the people who have been involved in the very detailed planning of this.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#J00200","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Before I invite Senator Black to speak on behalf of the Civil Engagement Group, I welcome its newest member Billie White.

I also want to say a huge thank you to Members of this House who came and shared their insight with us, namely, Senator Martin, the Cathaoirleach and my really good friend and colleague from the Civil Engagement Group, Senator Flynn.  <\/p> <p>I believe a new and united Ireland is not merely a political issue.  It is an optimistic and democratic aspiration held by millions of people on both sides of the Border and many more all around the world.  It is such a privilege as a chairperson of Ireland's Future to witness these kinds of conversations taking place all over Ireland and further afield.  It is amazing to hear actors, musicians, feminists, trade unionists, people from all walks of life, come together to speak about what constitutional change means to them.  Moreover, hearing people from unionist backgrounds such as Reverend Karen Sethuraman, Ben Collins and Jimmy Nesbitt speaking so brilliantly about their evolving conception of their identity was particularly special.  These are the kinds of nuanced insights that we can benefit from when we create spaces and forums where people can share ideas and perspectives that we do not often hear in normal political discourse.  Everyone knows that constitutional change will require a lot of work and listening and a capacity not only to tolerate but also celebrate difference and diversity.  Unity does not mean grafting two jurisdictions together.  It means taking a forensic look at what works and what does not on both sides of the Border.  It is our opportunity to question old ways of thinking and to generate new ideas and new paths forward.  It will require us to do work to create a true republic; one that is secular and multicultural; a republic that enjoys economic prosperity and stability, while also providing comprehensive and reliable public services.  We in the Oireachtas need to show leadership here.  That is why projects such as the Cathaoirleach's Public Consultation Committee on constitutional change are so welcome.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for setting up that committee.  I thoroughly enjoyed last week's session and look forward to the next one on Friday.  We need to do more work of this nature to create space for the research, dialogue, planning and preparing that will be necessary to make change a reality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#J00600","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

This narrative that people would abuse the right to take leave is something that we have seen before when it comes to any of these progressive measures.  It is not just disappointing but in this case it is particularly disturbing.  Survivors of domestic violence, the majority of whom are women, often suffer in silence.  They often downplay the abusive behaviour of their partners until it gets to the point where it is life-threatening.  Unfortunately, in some cases this is too late.  As a society we need to play our part and take every measure we can to put an end to domestic violence.  This includes encouraging and supporting those who are experiencing it to seek help without fear or favour.  Financial security is important to those who are trying to escape from a domestic violence situation.  An Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, report has found that 20% of workers took leave from work that involved attending medical appointments, attending court appearances, or trying to find alternative accommodation.  When I was an MEP in 2016 I brought forward the first proposal at an EU level for any European Union country calling for paid domestic violence leave.  That action was then taken up by my colleague Deputy O'Reilly in the D&aacute;il, and a Private Members' motion was passed calling for ten days of paid domestic violence leave.

It made me think outside the box and of those people who may be trying to escape violent situations and how it is possible.  We need to look at this.  The Minister for Transport needs to look at how we can make it more fair for people to be able to get onto buses without having a pre-booked ticket.<\/p> <p>Something really struck me in the House yesterday.  We can have a conversation and we are allowed to talk about Black Lives Matter.  It is very important that we have discussions around Black Lives Matter and black lives do matter.  It is not about how we do it; it is about the way we do it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Eileen Flynn:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is not a House for racism and discrimination towards any community.

The Good Friday committee, of which I am a member, went on a trip to Belfast approximately a year ago.  We met with the families of the disappeared.  We met with Oliver McVeigh, who is Columba McVeigh's brother.  It is utterly heartbreaking to say the least.  I am praying for the McVeigh family and I hope that finally after so many years that they can take their loved one home, give him a Christian burial, and look after him so that he is not left out there in the dirt, alone.<\/p> <p>Today, we are nine days on from the budget.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, made a really good announcement in the budget press conference in relation to school transport, which is an issue that many in this House have raised.  I am not asking for the Minister to come back into the House and I am not asking for another debate on it, because to be fair to the Minister, she has taken Commencement matters and she has taken a Private Members' motion in this House.  This has been dealt with in quite a lot of detail.  The result that we wanted was the result that came out of it, which is that additional funding has been set aside.  The Department is looking to try to sort out those capacity issues.  What I would like is to get some real detail from the Department, and that is why I am speaking today about it.  What is happening now?  We are now nine days on from the budget.  We have gotten one email from the Department to say it is looking at it and it is trying address capacity issues.<\/p> <p>How many children in this country are still without a bus ticket?  How many people's issues have now been resolved?  What is the plan?  We have been asking for the last five or six weeks and we have been working hard to try to make sure we have a plan in place.  The Minister has now put that money aside.  The money has been put aside and the Minister wants to fix the issue, but what is the plan as to how it will be fixed?  That is what I want to know and that is why I have raised it today in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>I would appreciate it if we could use this House and the Leader's office to try to engage with the Minister to find out what the plan is and what the timeline is for it.  These families have are now six or seven weeks into not having a bus.  They got really good news last week with the budget.  We are really happy with that and I commend the Minister on that, but I want to know what the timeframe is and when it will be resolved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#M00400","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":79,"content":"<p>I call Senator Carrigy and I welcome Ciara from his office, who is from Luxembourg and who is a student in Trinity College Dublin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#M00500","speaker":"1641"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":80,"content":"<p>I thank the Acting Chairperson for the warm welcome to Ciara.  I am looking for debate, and possibly a joint debate with the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Madigan, on the issue of summer provision.  We have had numerous discussions on the subject at the Joint Committee on Autism.  If we want to make changes for summer 2023, those changes need to be made now.  We had a number of teachers' unions and representative bodies before the committee yesterday.  They highlighted the lack of teachers who are taking part and the lack of teachers who are putting themselves forward for summer provision and, therefore, the severe lack of schools providing the summer provision.<\/p> <p>The reality is that 80% of the children, particularly those in special schools, got no summer provision last year.  That is more than 6,500 kids with severe needs who got no provision.  Those children regressed by the time they went back to school.  We need to address that issue now.  I am looking for a joint debate on the summer provision for 2023 with both Ministers of State.<\/p> <p>I concur with the comments made by Senator Casey with regard to tourism and the 9% VAT.  A number of months ago we met at committee level with the Irish Hotels Federation on the issue of price gouging in hotels.  The reality is, however, that these were hotels in Dublin, in particular.  That has created the situation where there is no talk of the VAT rate being extended.  The final answer on that has yet to be fully decided.  We need a conversation about it and to ensure we maintain our industry.  As Senator Buttimer said, it is not just hotels, but it is across the whole sector, including caf&eacute;s.  If we look at a number of countries in Europe, they split the VAT rate between restaurants and hotels.<\/p> <p>Last August, I was in the Diamond Coast Hotel in Enniscrone.  We spent three nights there as a family of five for &euro;700.  This was in the month of August.  That was reasonable.  That was replicated throughout the country.  It just seemed to be in Dublin, in particular, that there were these severely prices.  I do not think everybody else should pay for that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#M00600","speaker":"1639"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":81,"content":"<p>I welcome Eddie O'Reilly from Longford, who has served the nation with distinction in the Defence Forces.

There is a man who continues to be in prison because he will not purge his contempt in relation to a civil matter.  I am on the record as saying that the man in question, Mr. Enoch Burke, should purge his contempt.  I am concerned nevertheless about how, in a civil dispute on a relatively minor matter, a person could end up in jail for a considerable period of time and, in this case, regarding a matter that cannot be dealt with until at least Christmas in relation to the substantive issue of dispute.<\/p> <p>I understand clearly the courts have to uphold the rule of law.  At the same time, when one considers there are many reasons a person might not purge contempt, and there was a spectrum of virtue here ranging from a high conscience to sheer stubbornness, nonetheless, the court has to be concerned about the rule of law itself being brought into dispute where, in relatively minor matter, a person could continue to languish in prison for a long period of time.  I wonder whether other solutions can be found and whether we should help by discussing what legislative measures might bring into being alternative solutions.<\/p> <p>The second issue I would like to raise briefly is that of two retired judges who were appointed to the Dubai International Financial Centre, DIFC, Courts during the summer.  I believe senior agents of the State would have nominated them and encouraged them to take up those positions.  Nonetheless, after a campaign involving people such as the leader of the Labour Party and many others, they were effectively forced to step back from these positions that they had taken up and that they had been approached about.<\/p> <p>I am concerned about a trial-by-Twitter culture that puts pressure on private citizens in situations where the State itself fails to take a lead.  I have taken a lead by criticising the State's engagement with China.  I warn about our trade and other links with authoritarian regimes in China, the Middle East and elsewhere.  However, where we have a situation where the State is happy to do business with all sorts of regimes and takes a pragmatic approach to these matters, it is wrong that private citizens can be ganged up on and can be pointed at.  It is easy to point at other people, to embarrass them and to say what they ought or ought not to do.  Politicians let themselves down by getting on that particular bandwagon over the summer.  People have a right, as private citizens, to consider proposals that are put to them.  However, where the State, acting on behalf of the community fails to take a lead, it is a lamentable episode when private citizens then find themselves targeted for making what they regarded as a reasonable decision to take up a particular role.  The very agents of the State who perhaps encouraged them to take up the role were silent when they came under pressure.  There was something very unfair about that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#M00800","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":83,"content":"<p>Tens of thousands of people came into Ballinasloe this weekend for the Ballinasloe Fair and Festival.

Senator O'Loughlin spoke about her meeting with Jason Poole regarding his sister, who we know lost her life to domestic violence.  The Senator reiterated the call for a domestic violence register of offenders that would be accessed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and possibly potential victims.  It is the strong belief of Jason Poole that Jennifer would not have lost her life had that register been available.  A debate with the Minister for Justice has been requested.  This will happen in the next few weeks.  I think it will be towards the end of the month.  We are finalising what topics will be covered because there is a wide range to address in terms of antisocial behaviour and other justice areas and the Minister has not appeared in the Seanad for a quite some time.  It may be the case she will need to come back to the House for a second debate if it is not appropriate to group certain topics together.<\/p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin also spoke about the Adoption Authority of Ireland and the birth tracing and information legislation that has got up and running.  Four hundred applications were received on Monday.  She congratulated Eric Donovan and Fintan Bray.  Eric Donovan has become European boxing champion.  My party colleague Fintan Bray was the first person with Down's syndrome to be elected to a senior position in any party in the country.  I congratulate him on his election and wish him well for the term ahead.<\/p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about the approval by two Oireachtas committees of a request to release information from an Oireachtas laptop.  I do not propose to get into that.  People will understand the sensitivities around that matter, which is the subject of a criminal investigation.  She also raised issues around surrogacy and comments by another Member in yesterday's debate - references to it being simply a contract.  Obviously, she disagrees with those comments.  Again, I do not propose to get into a back-and-forth between two Members.<\/p> <p>Senator Clonan spoke about the debate last night on the high-level action plan for implementing the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces.  We had a very good debate.  I have put a request in through the Leader's office to get the Minister for Defence back into the Chamber at the earliest opportunity.  I thank him for being willing to come back in because he did not get much time yesterday to go into other areas.  There is a considerable degree of experience and interest in this House regarding these matters.  I concur with the Senator's remarks about the Reserve Defence Force as an aid to the civil authority.  There is a missed opportunity there.  There may have been a closed mind going back a number of years and possibly a fear of encroaching on somebody's else's territory.  I think we have moved past that and there is an opportunity there to explore the many talents and experience that reservists have to offer the country and assisting their partners in the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile congratulated Laochra Loch Lao, the Gaeltacht football team in Antrim that won the junior B championship.  He also referenced the Ireland&rsquo;s Future event, which took place last weekend.  He spoke about Lord McFall visiting the Oireachtas and speaking in this House today and welcomed the perceived change in tone, which I welcome, from the British Government so that things might get moving ahead in terms of Northern Ireland and wider issues.<\/p> <p>Senator Moynihan spoke about cost rental and social housing and raised the issue of specific housing development projects in Dublin city.  I am not familiar with the ins and outs of those projects.  This Government has for the first time delivered cost rental units.  There has been an unprecedented level of investment in housing.  A total of &euro;4.5 billion will be spent on housing next year.  It has never been at this level before, so every effort is being made to address the housing crisis, which we accept is ongoing.  However, it is not as though nothing is being done.  I take on board the Senator's comments around green spaces, playgrounds and community facilities, but local authorities are giving funding to provide those amenities.  That is their bread and butter.  That is their task.  If there is a shortfall in funding, an application should be made to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address that, but that should not prevent housing projects being delivered.  I think Senator Moynihan said it was 20 years for one particular project.  I would say there probably needs to be some accountability as to why a project has taken 20 years for and still has not yet been delivered.  I am not sure if that is the fault of the Minister.<\/p> <p>Senator Black extended her sympathies to the Mason family on the loss of Rory, who was fighting in Ukraine.  I concur with her remarks in that regard.  She also referenced Ireland's Future.  Senator Horkan welcomed the debate later with Lord McFall.<\/p> <p>Senator Cummins requested a debate with the Minister for Social Protection and that request has gone in.  That will probably form part of our budget debate but the request has been submitted.<\/p> <p>Senator Keogan asked for a debate on housing and I will make that request.  I take on board her point around the tracker mortgage scandal and the loss of family homes.  It does not matter what fine is given, you will never repair the damage done to those families.  The banks have a lot to answer for in that regard.  I was glad to see quite a hefty fine levied on Bank of Ireland, but it will never recover what those families lost.  That is the long and the short of it.<\/p> <p>Senator Casey raised the issue of the VAT rate on hospitality.  Both he and Senator Buttimer requested a debate on that issue and a wider debate on hospitality and tourism, which has been requested.<\/p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke about IBEC's objection to domestic violence leave.  I share her views.  IBEC asked for an economic analysis by Government to be completed to see if the cost benefit existed for employers to provide paid leave.  I think it is missing the point entirely.  If we are serious about eradicating the scourge of violence against women in this country, everybody needs to get on board.  We need employers on board.  The Government needs to assist employers, especially SMEs, in meeting that additional cost so there is a balance to be struck.  IBEC needs to reflect on its position.  Its lobbying was disappointing.<\/p> <p>Senator McGreehan spoke about fuel poverty and referenced Energy Cloud, the need to reduce waste and the number of families facing fuel poverty this winter.  It was welcome to see a &euro;12 increase across the board in social welfare payments, once-off &euro;500 payments to many households and an increase in the threshold for the fuel allowance.  Many more families will receive the fuel allowance this winter and for a longer period so the Government has provided a substantial social welfare package in that regard.<\/p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about schools in Limerick under the Creative Schools programme and the funding they will get.<\/p> <p>Senator Gallagher's contribution this morning was very emotional.  It is a difficult one to respond to.  My heart goes out to Oliver McVeigh and all of the McVeigh family on the loss of Columba and the fact that they have not been able to recover his body.  I sincerely hope that, one day, they will get the closure they need and that Columba is laid to rest with his parents.  They have had to go through and are still going through a heartbreaking situation.  I welcome the fact that the search has been resumed.<\/p> <p>Senator Flynn spoke about the pre-booking of tickets and how that might impact somebody fleeing domestic violence.  That is an interesting point I had not previously considered.  She also spoke about language, as she often does, and the need for respectful debate.<\/p> <p>Senator McGahon spoke about school transport.  I am pleased to give an update to the House.  Obviously, it was fantastic to see that the Minister for Education secured additional funding to put on extra buses to get extra capacity.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has been tasked with securing extra buses and drivers.  If we are honest about it, the Minister cannot magic up extra buses or drivers.  Every effort is being made to find those.  Families who applied on time and previously had concessionary tickets will be prioritised, which was sought and with which I agree.<\/p> <p>Senator Carrigy spoke about the summer provision and has requested a joint debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I do not believe there is provision to have a joint debate with two Ministers at the same time.  My understanding is it is under the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  A request will go to her office to request that debate at the earliest opportunity.<\/p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about the case of Enoch Burke, a fellow county person.  I would be aware of the situation.  I agree with the Senator's comments.  I think it does fall on the lower end of the scale in terms of offences.  I was surprised to see he ended up in Mountjoy Prison, which is usually home to some more serious offenders.  I think the matter should be expedited.  Having spoken to the governor of Mountjoy previously on a visit, he would be of the view that there are many people in that prison who should not be there and would be better served with other solutions, and I believe Enoch Burke is one of those people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#N00200","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is a civil matter rather than a criminal one.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#N00300","speaker":"1673"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":87,"content":"<p>Obviously, the rule of law is paramount.

His knowledge and interest in Ireland is clear.  His work in the Northern Ireland Office and his close support of those who played such a pivotal role in the peace process was vital at that time.  One of those he worked very closely with was the late Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mo Mowlam, who I am sure was a great friend of his.  In 1998, he was the first minister from the United Kingdom to be on the scene of the Omagh bombing on that sad day just hours after it happened.  He met family members of those killed or injured by that bombing in the days and weeks that followed and he said that event and those meetings made a real, lasting impression on him, and shaped him politically and personally.  His visit is an important opportunity to renew and reinforce his ties to Ireland.<\/p> <p>I express my appreciation to Lord McFall for affording me the opportunity to visit the House of Lords in October 2021 and the role he played in welcoming my colleague, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, to the Palace of Westminster this summer.  Regular, constructive and collaborative connections between the Oireachtas and the Parliament of the United Kingdom are vitally important.  In a period when our two Governments have taken quite different positions on policy, keeping political channels of engagement open is key.  The Seanad has developed a great appreciation for the role of the House of Lords and the role it plays in bringing balance to legislation and public debate in the United Kingdom.  In this new post-Brexit era, I believe bilateral relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom will continue to be of unique and fundamental importance.<\/p> <p>We share joint stewardship of the Good Friday Agreement.  While some have not always lived up to the ideals embodied in that agreement and the commitments given, we must work together.  It is the only true pathway forward.  Our economic relationships remain extensive and profound, benefiting both sides, and include huge flows of goods, services and people in both directions at all times.  Our expanding embassy presence in London, our newly launched consulates in Cardiff and Manchester, and our new bilateral frameworks with Lord McFall's home of Scotland have been significant steps in recent years.<\/p> <p>The UK ambassador to Ireland, H.E. Paul Johnston, was present when the Seanad marked the recent passing of Queen Elizabeth II.  Following her passing, we reflected deeply in this country on her legacy and her contribution to British-Irish relations and the peace process.  Queen Elizabeth's visit to Ireland in 2011, and especially her use of the Irish language, were watershed moments in the relationship between our two islands.  Building on those firm foundations of the Good Friday Agreement, Queen Elizabeth helped to usher in a new era of mutual respect, close partnership and sincere friendship between Ireland and Britain.<\/p> <p>Across the European Continent, and in British-Irish relations, we are best when we work together as partners.  I hope that in the years to come efforts to develop Ireland-UK bilateral relations to their fullest extent will succeed.  I thank the Lord Speaker for joining us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#P00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664962200,"counter":99,"content":"<p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.

It is a wonderful thing to be in Dublin today.  It is a particular pleasure to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I am deeply honoured to be the first Speaker of the United Kingdom's House of Lords to do this.  I am delighted to be here in person.  Our parliaments worked wonders with technology to keep us functioning during the pandemic but nothing will ever match face-to-face engagement.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his invitation.  As he mentioned, this is a return match following our meeting in Westminster one year ago.  I was also pleased to meet the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, when he visited Westminster in June.  I send him my best wishes for a speedy and full recovery.<\/p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for writing to express his condolences on behalf of the Seanad following the sad death of Her Majesty last month.  I am grateful for the words of sympathy expressed by him and others in this Chamber on 14 September, for the kind gesture of opening a book of condolence, the holding of a minute's silence in both Chambers, and the many expressions of support from across the country.  I was heartened to see both the Taoiseach and the President in London at the funeral of Her Majesty.  The sympathy and support brings home to me the closeness of the relationship between our two countries.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Lord McFall of Alcluith:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is my main theme for today and for my visit.<br\/><br\/>As others have done, I recall Her Majesty's state visit to Ireland in 2011 and some of the memorable moments of that remarkable visit, including her embrace of the Irish language, the wreath-laying ceremony in the Garden of Remembrance and her visit to Croke Park.  I also recall the return visit by President Michael D. Higgins three years later, when he addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament in the Royal Gallery, just next to the Chamber of the House of Lords.  I particularly recall how warmly those two great leaders were received and how those visits did so much to help the relationship strengthen between our nations.<br\/><br\/>Speaking in this Chamber I want to highlight the important role the Seanad has played in the political life of Ireland and over the past century.  In its centenary year, I acknowledge the continued importance of this historic Chamber.  I thank the Members of this Seanad for their invaluable work.  I have greatly enjoyed reading about the year-long programme of events to mark the centenary of the Seanad, such as Minority Voices, Major Changes.  I wish the Seanad well with its centenary sitting in December.<br\/><br\/>We know there are differences but there is much that unites us.  I think about the roles of our respective Chambers.  Each has a crucial and perhaps unappreciated role, both revising and advisory.  Both Chambers have long played an important part in making sure the wide range of views, including minority views, can be heard in our parliamentary systems.  There are some differences.  I have recently learned that there have been around 830 Senators in total in the 100-year history of the Seanad.  That is only a few more than the current membership of the House of Lords.  This at least helps me to understand why my role as a providing officer can feel so challenging at times.  I understand that the Seanad is taking on a scrutiny role in the adoption of European Union laws.  Though the United Kingdom is no longer a member of the EU, this is the type of scrutiny role with which the House of Lords, often working through all-party committees, is familiar.  I am certain we have much to learn from each other about how we can fulfil our responsibilities effectively.<br\/><br\/>Looking ahead I hope we will be able to continue and enhance the co-operation and engagement between Members of our two Chambers.  That is one of the ways we can make our contribution to resolving the uncertainties and difficulties in the relationships across these islands and involving the European Union.  The House of Lords has taken a close interest in this matter and Members will be aware that the UK's Northern Ireland Protocol Bill is due to receive its Second Reading in the House of Lords next Tuesday, 11 October.  Before taking up the post of Lord Speaker, as Senior Deputy Speaker I led the reorganisation of the committee system in the House of Lords.  This included the appointment of a Sub-Committee on the Protocol on Ireland\/Northern Ireland.  It is unique in that the House of Commons has no equivalent.  The committee is chaired by Lord Michael Jay, former head of the UK Foreign Office and an experienced diplomat.  He has been a regular visitor to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The committee also includes members with wide-ranging expertise, including a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a former Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and former leaders and deputy leaders of three of the political parties in Northern Ireland, representing both the unionist and nationalist communities.  In conversations I had with Lord Jay and a number of members of the committee, my visit was universally welcomed with enthusiasm.  The committee has a determination to make a useful contribution to scrutiny of the protocol and its operation.  It has consistently stressed the need for dialogue, constructive engagement, the building - and in some cases rebuilding - of trust and relationship building.  One key aspect of this has been its invaluable bilateral dialogue with committees of the Oireachtas and I know it will continue to prioritise this dialogue in the coming months.  As the committee said in its introductory report:<\/p><blockquote>\tThe tensions over the Protocol currently seem insoluble.  Yet that was also true of the political situation in Northern Ireland during the Troubles [and I am personal witness to that].  But through a slow and painstaking process led by political leaders in Northern Ireland and successive governments in London and Dublin, the peace process took root and flourished, leading to the Belfast\/Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent steps towards a power-sharing arrangement.  This process took time, patience, dialogue, and most of all trust.  The same is true in addressing the problems that Brexit and the Protocol present for Northern Ireland.  There is therefore an urgent imperative for all sides to make concerted efforts to build trust by recommitting themselves to that process of dialogue, repairing the damage caused to relations across these islands during the past five years, in the interests, as the Protocol rightly acknowledges, of communities in both Ireland and Northern Ireland. <\/blockquote><p>Therefore I am delighted with the news that talks between the UK Government and the European Union are to resume and that the political weather seems to be improving.<br\/><br\/>In my role as Lord Speaker of the House of Lords, I must be strictly politically impartial, representing the whole House.  This is an essential part of the trust that Members, from all parties and none, place in me to perform my duties even-handedly.  That said, I want to offer some personal reflections.  At the end of 1990, I was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Office.  I was proud to play a role in the huge steps that were taken then and I saw at first hand the value of taking time to build relationships and foster trust.  I saw the patient diplomacy of so many, including the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and Senator George Mitchell from the United States.  I was then a Labour MP and a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State but we were all happy to acknowledge that we were building on the good work started quietly, patiently and under the radar by John Major's Conservative Administration, working closely with the Administrations led by Albert Reynolds and John Bruton.  I also want to acknowledge the leadership and courage over that period of Northern Ireland politicians such as the late John Hume, Seamus Mallon and my good friend, David Trimble, whose funeral in Lisburn I was honoured to attend, along with the Taoiseach, the President and the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  One of the touching elements of that day was seeing Bertie Ahern go out at the end of the funeral and touch David Trimble's coffin.  That band of trust was there for all of us and we do not want to lose it.<br\/><br\/>It is inspiring to think we are looking forward next year to celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, signed back in 1998.  What lessons did I learn from seeing this at close hand and from playing my small part?  I learned that to reach agreements in the most difficult circumstances we have to be willing to do uncomfortable things.  We have to try to see the issue from the other person's perspective, we have to recognise historical differences and nonetheless decide to work together and we must set aside any thoughts of our own advantage.  We must also show courage and take risks in the pursuit of worthwhile goals.  I addressed students at University College Dublin, UCD, yesterday.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Lord John McFall of Alcluith:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->My final remarks to them were that politics is hard and politics is difficult when you have to make choices, so just remember that.  In my address to the Senators, I say that if they talk to any of their friends and say the Lord Speaker was here talking to Senators, they should say it was John McFall but not to leave it at John McFall.  Say, our friend John McFall, because my visit is all about friendship.  We must ensure we have the right structures and opportunities for our representatives to come together.  I pay tribute to the valuable role of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together Senators and Teachta D&aacute;la from the Oireachtas and Lords and MPs from Westminster.  This body also includes members from the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and the legislators of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man, which makes the BIPA the only parliamentary assembly with membership across these islands.<\/p><p>It was my great honour to host the BIPA members of the House of Lords during the most recent plenary session in February.  I hope we will be able to welcome everyone back to Westminster in the near future.  In fact, Deputy Brendan Smith chaired that BIPA meeting and I reminded him that in my post-ministerial life, I made an informal visit to the D&aacute;il and sat in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  I was not in any official position on that occasion and I think the Speaker was Se&aacute;n Treacy.  I recall that, at the beginning he stood up and welcomed me, but in welcoming me he said, \"We wish to give a warm welcome to the Canadian Prime Minister.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#P00700","nonspeaker":"Lord McFall of Alcluith","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664962200,"counter":104,"content":"<p>(Interruptions).<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664962200,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I engaged in frantic gestures as a result.  Brian Mulroney was the Prime Minister of Canada at the time, so I think Se&aacute;n got my message and he said in a very slick manner, &quot;Well, whoever you are, you are most welcome.&quot;  Outside the venue Dick Spring passed me and bowed saying, &quot;Good afternoon, Prime Minister.&quot;  That time was my little bit of sunshine.<br\/><br\/>I know that the Houses of the Oireachtas are looking forward to hosting the 62nd plenary later this month in Cavan.  I thank Senators and Deputies in the Oireachtas delegation for their contribution to the work of the assembly, including the Vice Chair, Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile, the committee Chair, Senator Emer Currie, the Co-Chair, Deputy Brendan Smith, and all of the Senators and Deputies who play such a valuable role in the delegation.<br\/><br\/>I was a member of the British-Irish parliamentary body from the 1980s.  We did not have any substantial agendas but we spoke together and talked extensively.  We enjoyed our social life together and I compliment you on having such a good social life here.  What our meetings did when we came to the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process was to ensure we knew each other and that we had a level of understanding.  I was the Minister of Education, Training and Health in Northern Ireland and the current Taoiseach was the Minister for Education in the South at the time, so we have known each other for quite a long time.  This morning, I had a meeting with the Taoiseach and he gave me extensive time.  The engagement I had with him felt like that of old friends meeting again, and that is what I am looking for in the future relationship between the Parliament in Westminster and the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the recent establishment of an Ireland-UK Parliamentary Friendship Group, under the leadership of Senator Lisa Chambers.  I am sure this group will make a valuable contribution to strengthening Ireland-UK parliamentary links.  Lisa has an open invitation to contact my office or come and see me any time.<br\/><br\/>I would like to take this unique opportunity to extend an invitation to Members of the Oireachtas, including the new friendship group, to come to Westminster for meetings with their counterparts.  The informality of meetings is important; it is not the formality of them.  When meetings are made formal, then there are rules and regulations and there are obstacles.  I want to encourage that informal approach because I want to keep working to develop and strengthen the ties between our two Chambers.  I hope these will become regular meetings.<br\/><br\/>Let me talk about the importance of community engagement.  As important as contact between Parliaments is, we must never stop engaging with our communities.  Even though this is necessarily a brief trip, I had a thoroughly enjoyable and interesting visit yesterday, as I mentioned, to University College Dublin's centre for peace and conflict research.  I spoke to the students there, who are highly engaged and thoughtful about the roles of the House of Lords within the British Constitution.  I look forward to my visit this afternoon to the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation because it is the community that matters very much and I want to understand that.  When I visited Northern Ireland last year, I went to a community engagement.  I visited the Shankill Women's Centre on the Shankill Road to engage with the people there, because if we are going to have solidity in our relationships, then there must be trust in the community.  That is a <i>non sequitur<\/i>.<br\/><br\/>The close relationship between our two Parliaments is a reflection of the long-established social and family relationships between the people of our countries.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who were born in Ireland and now live in the United Kingdom and UK-born people who now live in Ireland.  These are people who enrich and enliven our societies and economies to our huge mutual benefit.  My region in the west of Scotland has a long-established Irish community that has greatly influenced and enriched our cultural life.  It would be wrong of me to get sidetracked at this point and highlight our close sporting connections just so that I could mention the result of last week's football match between Scotland and Ireland at Hampden Park.  I shall avoid doing that.<br\/><br\/>Regarding reasons for us to work together, our bonds are strong and enduring, but I know the Cathaoirleach and Senators will agree that co-operation has never been more necessary.  We live in difficult and very uncertain times.  There are so many areas that require us to rise to the challenge and where we are stronger when we work together.  One of my most vivid memories of my parliamentary career is the address to Members of both Houses of the UK Parliament by President Zelenskyy of Ukraine in March.  I was similarly moved when I watched the broadcast of President Zelenskyy's address to this Parliament in April.  As I said at the parliamentary assembly meeting of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, when it met in Birmingham in July, there are some things about which we cannot and we must not be neutral.  We must be resolute in defending democratic values and the fundamental importance of human rights, and responding to acts of aggression.  I applaud the generosity and the famous hospitality of the people in Ireland in offering welcome and shelter to so many people from Ukraine and, indeed, to other refugees.<br\/><br\/>Energy and climate change are obvious critical areas where we must show leadership and continue to work closely together.  We must listen to one another and we must hear what other people say, because the curse of modern society is that we hear people but we do not listen, which is exacerbated by social media.  That listening and making time for other people is an essential characteristic of our relationship.<br\/><br\/>Although I am the first Lord Speaker to speak in this historic Chamber, I trust that I will not be the last.  Let us build enduring relationships between our two Parliaments.  Let us work together with energy and in good faith to build warmth and trust between our great historic nations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Lord John McFall of Alcluith"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":106,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat, Lord Speaker.

As he said, it is an awful lot smaller and more intimate than the House of Lords but he is very welcome.  It was mentioned that we held a minute's silence in the presence of the British ambassador, H.E. Mr. Paul Johnston, a number of weeks ago.  I think we can all agree the outpouring of sorrow throughout the world demonstrated the enormous regard in which the British Queen was held through her 70-year reign.  The nicest comment I heard came from Emmanuel Macron, when he said of the British people that she was their queen but that to the rest of us in the world, she was \"the queen\".  I thought that was a fitting tribute.<\/p> <p>I believe Lord McFall of Alcluith is the first Lord Speaker to hail from Scotland, a country that, as he will be well aware, is similar to our own in terms of culture, music, language, scenery and, for better or worse, the weather.  Ours are both sporting nations, as he mentioned, and while Scotland might have the upper hand when it comes to football, he will not mind us gloating us a little bit when it comes to rugby because we have to have something.  I am also told he has served as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on scotch whisky.  Some of my colleagues here might take note.  We have never had one of those here but it is a committee membership that I think people would be slightly envious of, so he might tell us more about it over lunch.<\/p> <p>Like many of us, Lord McFall of Alcluith hails from humble beginnings, in Dumbarton, Scotland, but he has had what can only be described as an illustrious career to date.  In his time at Westminster, he has been Lord Commissioner of the Treasury and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for nine years.  He was also chair of the Treasury Select Committee and senior deputy speaker of the House of Lords.  He now holds the distinguished title of Lord Speaker and I am absolutely sure it is well deserved, so I congratulate him on that.<\/p> <p>Having served in the Northern Ireland Office in the year that followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, he is no stranger to our island, its past and present and, I hope, its bright future.  As was mentioned, he was the first British Minister to arrive in Omagh following that dreadful bombing in 1998 and he knows the political will it took to reach the Good Friday Agreement after decades of sectarian conflict and violence.  He knows that previous attempts at peace resulted in deadlock, but the efforts of numerous men and women have all but secured a better future for this generation and the generations to come.  He will also know, however, that a better future for Northern Ireland is not guaranteed, and that is what I would like to touch on today as the Leader of this House and the head of the Fine Gael group in the Seanad.<\/p> <p>The British Queen's visit to Ireland, which was mentioned earlier, marked a significant high point in the relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  While our relationship has remained strong, neighbours sometimes have disagreements.  Unfortunately, as we can all agree, the recent years that have passed since the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU, which we respect, have represented a turbulent time in our relationship.  The Irish Government has continuously expressed its disapproval of the British Government's Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, for example.  It is unlawful and damaging and adds to the existing uncertainty in the North, especially in Border communities and the business community.  We have also, particularly in this House, wholeheartedly condemned the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill, which seeks to offer an amnesty to the perpetrators of heinous crimes that were carried out during the Troubles.  I believe the draft legislation is reprehensible and, on the record of this House, I again urge the British Government to take the time to listen to the victims and families who are still waiting for justice.  In the face of all this and of a deepening cost-of-living crisis that is not unique to any of our countries, Northern Ireland is still without a fully functioning Assembly or a new Executive following the elections in May, and we all know how regrettable that is.<\/p> <p>While the Lord Speaker is impartial to a tee and he could not possibly remark on some of those sentiments, I know he will agree dialogue must always remain open between our countries and our Governments.  He talked briefly about how important relationships are and I could not agree with him more.  They are the only thing that will break that political deadlock.  I thank John, our friend, for coming to address us today and look forward to spending some time with him over the course of his visit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#S00100","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I welcome Lord McFall of Alcluith here for this address.  I am speaking on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group in the Seanad.  I had the pleasure of meeting him last night and again this morning with the Parliamentary Friendship Group.  It was clear from our meetings, and from having read much about him in preparation for the visit, that he has a passion for both Northern Ireland and Ireland and a clear and in-depth understanding of the challenges our island faces both North and South.  His work in the Northern Ireland office, and his being on the ground so shortly after the Omagh bombing, is a tribute and testament to his character and to his commitment to resolving the ongoing issues we face.<\/p> <p>I have reflected on his comments this morning on the loss of institutional knowledge, whereby those who were there almost 25 years ago when the Good Friday Agreement was signed are no longer working at the forefront of these challenging issues.  That is a very important point.  There is much knowledge and expertise that we are not drawing to the extent that we could.  He referred to Tony Blair, Bertie Ahern, Martin Mansergh and others, and there is scope to bring those people back to work on this issue because they have knowledge and expertise to offer.<\/p> <p>The British Embassy did great work in organising Lord McFall of Alcluith's trip here and in working with all of us.  It has done a remarkable job, amid testing times over the past six years, of maintaining that dialogue and connection between our two countries.  It has done much behind-the-scenes work, which is often not seen but is very important.<\/p> <p>Lord McFall of Alcluith mentioned earlier that he has removed his armour as a politician and is now a \"facilitator\".  He is not overtly political but, obviously, in his heart, he has political views he still holds.  Brexit is still a key issue for us, even if other issues have overshadowed it in recent years, such as the cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine.  I take great solace in the reigniting of discussions, such as was seen in the recent call between the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. James Cleverly, and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi on 30 September.  Things are moving again, and there has been commentary that the mood music and the tone of the British Government has changed.  That is to be welcomed and we want to work towards a solution.  The comments following that phone call indicated we had to bring predictability and certainty to Brexit, which is what the Northern Ireland protocol is all about.<\/p> <p>One item of legislation that is working its way through the British Parliament is the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.  We have great difficulties with it, although I know the House of Lords will do its best to analyse that and provide scrutiny of the legislation.  Other legislation relates to legacy issues, as our House Leader mentioned, which are very important to us.  There are few issues where all of us on this island absolutely agree, but on that issue and that legislation we are united in our opposition and we reiterate that point in the strongest possible way.<\/p> <p>As we approach the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, an event on which we all have our own views as to how we should mark, it is important to acknowledge we have come a long way but the peace is in progress.  It is never complete and it must be maintained and protected.  We can never take it for granted.<\/p> <p>I thank Lord McFall of Alcluith for being the first Lord Speaker to come to this House, although he will probably not be the last.  I am sure he has set a precedent.

I thank him for hosting that wonderful lunch at the pavilion at the Palace of Westminster for the members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Association, BIPA.  There are a number of BIPA members here today.  It is a very important organisation.  I thank Lord McFall for visiting in this important year for us, the centenary of the Seanad.  Ireland and the UK both operate a bicameral parliamentary system and, therefore, we understand the checks and balances and tensions, at times, there can be in a bicameral parliamentary system, but it is a good system.<\/p> <p>I was conscious, both last night and when I spoke to him at the Palace of Westminster, that Lord McFall of Alcluith had an unusual entry into politics, having studied chemistry and been a teacher of maths.  He left school as a young teenager, in what were difficult times for him, but he had a social conscience and a concern for welfare and equality issues that drove and motivated him.  He has weaved those convictions through every aspect of his life and that is quite outstanding.  He took an unusual route into politics and little could he have known at 15 years old that not only would he be elected as first speaker of the House of Lords but that he would one day address the Irish Parliament.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Our Leader has touched on the significance of the Lord Speaker being Scottish.  There are also Welsh people.  There are a lot of commonalities across these islands.  We have a shared interest in culture and history and shared experiences, which must never be forgotten.  I thank him.  Lord McFall of Alcluith put great emphasis on language.  Friendships and relationships are important.  So are words and so is language.  Our Leader spoke about Queen Elizabeth and the famous speech she gave when she came to Dublin Castle in which she spoke a few words of Irish.  Last Friday, the select committee addressed the constitutional debate on the island of Ireland in this Chamber.  The Rev. Kyle Paisley opened by speaking and acknowledging the Cathaoirleach as Gaeilge.  That was profound.  They were simple words.  It is really important.  Language is important.  It also shows an understanding and respect for that difference.  We do not have to oppose each other.  We have uniquenesses and differences but we also have many shared objectives, issues and experiences.  I know the Lord Speaker is committed to building on that friendship and that partnership.  <\/p><p>As I said, he hosted that reception for the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA.  I acknowledge the importance of that assembly.  As Lord McFall of Alcluith rightly said, it is the only assembly of parliaments across these islands that meets on a regular basis.  I will make an ask of him.  When he goes back to the Westminster, I ask him to use his power and influence to see how we can expand the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and continue to build on those relationships.  I acknowledge and thank Lord Alf Dubs.  The Lord Speaker spoke about friendship.  Lord Dubs is a great colleague of his and a great friend to Ireland.  I also acknowledge Deputy Feighan, the Minister of State, and Deputy Brendan Smith, the co-chair of BIPA, as champions.  They have done great work in building relationships, friendships and shared experiences between the islands.  <\/p><p>To touch on what Senator Chambers said, I acknowledge the British Embassy officials here today and their sterling work.  I acknowledge the important work of the British and Irish Embassies and their staff as well as the sensitivities around diplomacy in the diplomatic missions and the work they undertake.  I have no doubt that we are in good stead with their quiet work, which paves the way for negotiations and meaningful discussions between these islands.  Peace, reconciliation and prosperity on the island of Ireland is important.  I acknowledge and thank the Taoiseach for his shared island initiative.  We do not need to keep waiting for change.  We need to talk now, today, next week, next month and next year about what we can do to share respect and to continue building our relationships.  I say to the people of Scotland and Wales who are also seeking their identity that they should acknowledge that.  I hope we can work collectively in the short term through our work in BIPA.  I ask the Lord Speaker to use his good strong influence and the respect he commands within the Palace of Westminster to explore how we can continue to develop BIPA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#S00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":111,"content":"<p>On behalf of the Green Party, I extend a very warm welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann to Lord McFall of Alcluith.  He is a reforming voice in his own House and, in many respects, his quest for reform of the House of Lords mirrors an appetite for real reform of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  For instance, he is on record as saying that he would like to see the House of Lords as a vibrant outward-facing legislature that reaches out as widely as possible.  He has described himself as a change agent.  We could do with more change agents in this jurisdiction.  I was interested in another comment of his in which he said that muscular unionism does not work and has to adapt.  In respect of adapting, I would say to those who have legitimate concerns that the basis of the protocol is to avoid a hard border, a situation that is unavoidable where an EU frontier meets the frontier of a third country outside of the customs union and the Single Market.  Brexit has caused us to peer under the bandage of the healing and precious peace process on the island.  What we now see is not likely to have been envisaged at the time of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the emergence of a new third force in Irish politics North of the Border, an identity that is neither unionist nor nationalist but that is comfortable being Irish, British and European.  This is an ideology grounded in a politics that is more interested in bread-and-butter issues than in the division of identity politics.  I believe this is the future.<\/p> <p>The protocol gives Northern Ireland a unique place in the three universes it inhabits.  First, it is unique in the United Kingdom in that it has full access to the joint European market and its citizens, by reason of their Irish identity, have full rights to EU citizenship.  Second, it is unique in the European Union in that it has full access to the British market and that its citizens, by reason of their British identity, have full rights to British citizenship.  Third, it is unique on the island of Ireland in that it has the best of both worlds, something that people in the South do not enjoy to the same extent.<\/p> <p>I was struck by the comments of Sorcha Eastwood MLA of the Alliance Party, which had a very good election North of the Border.  Shortly after her election in Lagan Valley, she is reported to have said that only two people mentioned concerns about the protocol on the doorsteps.  As a member of an all-island party, the Green Party, I am personally unaware of any person mentioning it to a canvasser on the doorsteps.  That is not to say it is not a very serious issue for some.  It clearly is but I call for the required perspective.  I note that, over the weekend, one of the Lord Speaker's successors in the Northern Ireland Office, Steve Baker MP, apologised, saying that he was really sorry that relations with Ireland are not where they should be.  It takes a brave person to apologise.  I believe this apology should be accepted at face value and that we should all move on together with genuine intent and accelerated urgency.  <\/p> <p>I commend the leaders of Scottish nationalism and of Irish nationalism and republicanism on the respectful way they conducted themselves on the occasion of the recent passing of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II.  They are proud, confident and dignified in their beliefs but the respectful way they conducted themselves at the time of what many on the island found to be a very sad loss portrayed them in a very positive light to a global audience.  In acting in this way, I believe they advanced their causes.  Lord McFall of Alcluith's presence here today advances the cause of better Anglo-Irish relations at this critically important time.  I thank him for visiting us today and addressing Seanad &Eacute;ireann.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#T00200","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":112,"content":"<p>Cuirim fearadh na f&aacute;ilte roimh an Phr&iacute;omh-Thiarna agus roimh a chomhghleacaithe &oacute; Ambas&aacute;id na Breataine at&aacute; linn don &oacute;c&aacute;id stairi&uacute;il seo.

The Cathaoirleach mentioned that the Lord Speaker's people are from the great county of Tyrone, the O'Neill county with its own proud history, rich in Gaelic lords, chiefs and history.  It does not have a bad football side either at the minute.  He also spoke about a number of what-ifs.  If the Lord Speaker's father or grandfather had gone west, might he have come back as the Speaker of the House of Representatives?  The Cathaoirleach failed to say that if that ancestor had stayed in Tyrone, the Lord Speaker might be in his seat.  Nevertheless, it is good to have him in the particular seat he is occupying this afternoon.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> I will move to more serious matters.  What resonated with me was Lord McFall's institutional memory and experience of negotiating and bedding in the Good Friday Agreement.  I respectfully say that is something that has been sorely lacking in the British Government in recent years.  Much like the Good Friday Agreement itself was a compromise, as Lord McFall knows, the protocol that is so prominent in political life at the moment is also a compromise.  The threat posed to the Good Friday Agreement to peace and progress in Ireland, to our economy and society has been Brexit.  The protocol is helping to attract investment and create jobs throughout Ireland.  Lord McFall knows that international agreements and international law must be upheld.  The protocol must be built upon, not undermined.<\/p><p>The Cathaoirleach mentioned Lord McFall's attendance at the scene of the Omagh bombing and Lord McFall reflected that he will be heading to Glencree later this afternoon.  As other colleagues have rightly said - this Seanad unanimously rejected the British Government's legacy proposals in a motion brought by Senator Currie - the amnesty Bill is an affront to democracy and justice and it is rejected by every party on this island and by many parties on Lord McFall's island.<\/p><p>A key component throughout Lord McFall's address was the importance of dialogue and engagement.  I agree with him on that wholeheartedly.  In a week where some have engaged in some very reckless, regressive and dangerous sabre rattling about the funeral and burial of the Good Friday Agreement, the onus is on all of us, no matter our position &ndash; non-political, civic, academic, community, voluntary, cultural and arts &ndash; not least the co-guarantors of the agreement in the form of the British and Irish Governments, to ensure it is defended, upheld and above all else, fully implemented.<\/p><p>In the centenary year of the Seanad, it is great to have Lord McFall here.  As one of the Vice Chairs of the Irish delegation to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, I thank him for hosting us at Westminster and giving us his contribution and hospitality that day.  As I have already said, and as other colleagues have rightly reflected, the great strength and lesson of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements is the ability to come together to talk, understand each other, hear each other and to cut through a lot of the noise.  I am lucky to have someone who was involved with some of the tentative and early days of the peace process working with me in my office and he always encourages me to light a candle rather than curse the dark.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#T00500","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":116,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to welcome the Lord Speaker to Ireland and to this Chamber on behalf of the Civil Engagement Group.  In my capacity as a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we are in regular contact with British and Northern Irish parliamentarians.  I have found the engagement between our institutions to be stimulating and fruitful.  I know that developing a relationship is a major concern of Lord McFall.  I find his work in this area to be incredibly valuable.  He knows himself, from his time as a Northern Ireland Minister in the late 1990s, how significant the Good Friday Agreement is to the future of the island and to relationships between our islands.  I hope he will agree with me, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the agreement, that we all need to reaffirm our commitment to it.<\/p> <p>When I first visited Westminster as part of a parliamentary delegation in the wake of Brexit, I found that it was sometimes difficult for people to understand the impact that Britain leaving the EU would have on the fragile institutions of Northern Ireland and the British-Irish relationship.  However, we received a very warm welcome in the House of Lords.  I found the Members there to be very knowledgeable and genuinely concerned about Ireland.  Many of the people I talked to held Government positions during and immediately after the Good Friday Agreement and so understood its value and that it was the product of extensive negotiations based on mutual respect and a real effort to understand fundamentally different perspectives.<\/p> <p>I note the comments from the Northern Ireland Office Minister, Steve Baker, who apologised to Ireland and the EU for some bad-faith behaviour on the part of Britain in its withdrawal negotiations.  I echo the Taoiseach in welcoming these comments.  It is brave to admit when one has done wrong, and it is an important gesture for those of us on both sides of the Irish Sea who are eager to begin the process of repairing our diplomatic relationship.  Britain and Ireland's histories are inextricably linked.  The migration between us means that there are many people with fluid, hybrid identities - people who are British and Irish.  It is only right that as neighbours we have a strong and stable relationship, but that requires trust, respect and understanding.  These are crucial but, unfortunately, they are being undermined by recent actions of the British Government.  The attempts by Britain to unilaterally alter the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol are massively concerning.  It threatens the stability and prosperity of Northern Ireland and the freedom of movement across the Border in Ireland.<\/p> <p>I live in Dublin, but my father's family is from Rathlin Island, an island between Scotland and Ireland, which is just off the coast of Antrim.  I have spent time there since childhood and I still do.  I am one of the many people who regularly travel between the North and the Republic.  My family history transcends the Border on this island and I, like every other Irish person, will not be impeded because Britain chose to leave the EU.  Negotiations between the EU and Britain are resuming soon for the first time in several months.  I hope that they generate a workable path forward.  As the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill enters the House of Lords next week, I hope Lord McFall's colleagues can be voices of reason, moderation and foresight.<\/p> <p>Another issue of concern to us that will soon be debated in the House of Lords is the British Government's legacy Bill, which provides a de facto amnesty for people who committed brutal crimes across this island, sometimes with state collusion.  As I am sure everyone knows, this legislation has been rejected by every political party North and South as grievously insulting and clearly impermissible under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which mandates states to effectively investigate suspicious deaths.  We look to the Westminster Parliament to uphold the rule of law and guarantee effective scrutiny and accountability.  I very much hope the House of Lords can play a positive role in convincing the British Government to step back from this ledge.  This crude attempt to whitewash history and impose impunity has no place in a democracy.<\/p> <p>I thank Lord McFall for visiting us and for his willingness to have friendly but frank discussions about such important matters.  There are many tasks ahead of us that require a strong diplomatic relationship between our countries.  We must provide clarity and comfort to those impacted by legacy issues.  We must support the return of power sharing in Northern Ireland, and we must come to a workable, final settlement on the Northern Ireland protocol.  These are daunting challenges, but the legacy of the Good Friday Agreement demonstrates the transformative power of honesty, good faith and fair play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#U00200","speaker":"1632"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":117,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#U00300","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":118,"content":"<p>The Lord Speaker will now respond.

I do not drink so Members need not worry about that.<\/p> <p>I understand the political issues and they will be articulated in Westminster next week.  The road ahead could be long and difficult but if we do not stay together on it then we will fail.  The resolution is that we stay together.  That element is very important.  What has been mentioned about taking time to listen, whether it was to the Taoiseach's remarks earlier in Oxford or to Steve Baker, is that we do not understand each other.  That is a feature.  We have got to understand each other.  We can only do that by face-to-face engagement.  As far as I am concerned, that is the message from today.<\/p> <p>Mention was made about muscular unionism.  I have lived in Scotland all my life, 70 odd years, so I am as Scottish as anybody.  If I am cut, the blood is Scottish.

It is not a matter of restoring trust.  It cannot be restored.  Trust must be given; it cannot be restored.  If people are going to be convinced, there is a sense of ownership.  At the conference last Saturday, James Nesbitt of \"Bloodlands\" fame, mentioned that point from his unionist perspective.  That respect is integral.<\/p><p>I mentioned that politics is difficult.  We can have successes and failures.  I spent the vast part of my life in teaching, as I mentioned.  In the 1970s, I was a deputy headmaster in charge of pastoral care for pupils.  I was involved in engagement and headed a truancy unit to get young kids into school.  The social dimension was important, and that has lived with me.  When I was an MP, I was invited to Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow during Christian Aid Week by one of the sisters who worked there.  We had a good reception for the prisoners.  On the way out, I saw a van coming in.  Out of the van came a young fellow, handcuffed between two policeman.  As I passed, I heard, \"Hello, Mr. McFall\".  I turned around and said, \"Hello, how are you?\"  He said to me, \"How am I?\"  It was obvious how we was.  With a bit of pride, he lifted himself up, looked over and said, \"See Mr. McFall?  He used to be my guidance teacher.\"  There I was in charge of pastoral care and this young guy ends up in prison.  What does that tell me?  It tells me that failure is never fatal.  It tells me that success is never final.  Walk along the road with each other.  I can only leave Senators with the inscription on Seamus Heaney's headstone, which reads, \"Walk on air against your better judgment\".  Let us walk together with that spirit in mind.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#U00500","nonspeaker":"Lord McFall of Alcluith","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":121,"content":"<p>To conclude, we have someone who, like Lord McFall's great-grandfather, has a link to County Tyrone.

On the sovereign committee, we are currently doing a report about the future relationship between Britain and Ireland or England and Ireland.  The report touches on Anglo-Irish relations and the future relationship between the two sovereign Governments.  We did not just lose a neighbour when the UK left the EU, we also lost the opportunity for those close relationships at EU meetings, those informal meetings about which Lord McFall was so articulate.  We must find a way to replicate and replace those meetings.<\/p> <p>I cannot let the opportunity pass without echoing the words of my colleagues in respect of the two Bills coming before the House of Lords.  We see a chink of light with the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill but we do not see the same chink of light when it comes to the legacy Bill.  Echoing what others have said today, I ask Lord McFall to bring back what he has heard, to listen to all the political parties on this island, and to the UN and the Council of Europe.  Most importantly, I ask Lord McFall to listen to victims who are telling us that this is not the solution.  We know the importance of the rule of law in Westminster.  We are asking the UK to act in full compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.<\/p> <p>Now that the mood music is changing with respect to the Northern Ireland protocol, I must say it is not just about the Assembly, which we desperately want to see up and running, but it is about the work of all of the institutions across the three strands of the Good Friday Agreement.

I am pleased to be in the House today to present the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2022, which provides for fundamental reform of the judicial appointments process.<\/p><p>We have a strong record of judicial excellence and independence.  We are well served by the Judiciary and it is important to acknowledge this.It is also important that we review our legislation to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose.  The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, introducing the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, was a significant reform.  In line with a commitment in the programme for Government, we are now proposing to establish a new judicial appointments commission.  The enactment of this legislation will enable the continued appointment of excellent judges, who are a cornerstone of a strong, independent Judiciary.<\/p><p>The Bill will allow for the creation of a new commission to replace the JAAB and it will recommend persons for appointment as judges by the President on the advice of the Government under the Constitution.  It will also recommend persons for nomination by the Government to international courts outside the State.  The Bill provides for a nine-person commission with a wide remit to select and recommend persons for appointment, to develop new modern processes for selection and to publish the requirements for judicial positions.  The Bill introduces a new recommendation and appointments process and ensures that the process of selection is conducted in a modern, open and transparent way by an independent commission.  The Bill will underpin the principles of meritocracy and independence.  It provides for a merit-based system of selection and that the commission will be independent.<\/p><p>An independent Judiciary and the efficient and effective administration of justice are both fundamental elements of the rule of law.  This independence is important in ensuring public confidence in the courts to uphold the law.  It brings social and economic benefits and allows people to be assured that when their rights are infringed or when the duties of other parties need to be enforced, the appropriate response will be taken in our courts.  The Bill is designed to meet both our own constitutional standards and the standards set by the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding independence and the rule of law in judicial appointments, as well as recommendations of the Council of Europe&rsquo;s Committee of Ministers.<\/p><p>Perhaps the most important aspect of the reforms is that the new commission will become the single focus and means for the selection and recommendation of persons for appointment to judicial office.  It will bring together the disparate existing arrangements, taking over the current mandate of JAAB, selecting serving judges who apply for higher office, which is outside JAAB&rsquo;s remit, and incorporating the existing roles of the Ministers for Justice and for Foreign Affairs in selecting persons for nomination to courts outside the State.  What this means is that the principles that are applied to selecting and recommending persons for judicial appointment under this Bill, such as transparency and the open application process, are applied in all cases.<\/p><p>This legislation provides for a single process for the appointment or nomination by the Government to judicial office.  No other process will operate other than what is proposed under the Bill.  All promotional appointments to any judicial office, including as president of a court or as Chief Justice, or to external courts such as the Court of Justice, will come under the remit of the new commission.  The focus is also on nominations to the Court of Justice, General Court, European Court of Human Rights and International Criminal Court and I wanted to incorporate these judicial positions in the statutory scheme and commission mandate.  The Bill will therefore allow for better consistency between domestic and international judicial appointments processes.<\/p><p>The JAAB template and remit under the Courts and Court Officers Act will change markedly.  An application process with clear qualification and eligibility criteria, testing and interview procedures, requirements relating to training and a restricted list of three recommendations to Government will apply.  The Bill provides that a person cannot be appointed by the Government without a recommendation by the commission, and nor can a person be nominated for appointment or election to specified international courts without being recommended by the commission.  The Bill will ensure that the system is fit for purpose.  We should rightly aim to put in place a world-leading model that has the objectives of serving the public and of further supporting an efficient, fair and effective justice system in which the public has confidence.  I am confident the commission will achieve this goal through the selection of candidates for judicial office through fair and open competition from the widest range of possible candidates.<\/p><p>The programme for Government commitment to bring forward this reform was clear.  The new commission is to be chaired by the Chief Justice.  The Chief Justice has chaired the JAAB since its inception some 25 years ago.  I thank the Chief Justice, his predecessors and all of the JAAB members for their commitment over that period.  The new commission is also to have an equivalence of judicial and lay members, which I am satisfied is the best arrangement, taking into account international standards and best practice in other jurisdictions.  Lay members will be appointed through open competition, with selections to be made by the Public Appointments Service, and they will bring a wide range of expertise and knowledge into the selection process.  The commission will have no members of the legislative branch or the executive branch of government in its voting membership.  <\/p><p>Part 1 of the Bill deals with interpretations, including some key definitions and other standard introductory matters.  Part 2 provides for a new judicial appointments commission, including arrangements for its establishment.  Section 9 provides for the membership of the commission, comprising the Chief Justice as chairperson and four judicial members, two of whom will be nominated by the Judicial Council, as well as four lay members appointed by the Minister.  The Attorney General is a member in a non-voting capacity.  The Attorney General is a constitutional officeholder who has an important role in upholding the independence of the Judiciary.  The Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 provided for three lay members out of a total membership of ten and later three out of 11 when the President of the Court of Appeal was added.  I believe the enhanced outside expertise that can be provided through lay involvement will be an important addition to the commission.  Lay members will bring knowledge and experience of the courts, the justice system, business, human rights and corporate governance.  I also believe court presidents, as required, should be members when the relevant recommendations are being made.  While the President of the Court of Appeal is a permanent member, when, for example, recommendations for appointment to the High Court are in question, it will be the President of the High Court who will become a member of the commission instead.  That will be the case for the other courts as well. <\/p><p>Section 12 will provide for the nomination of two judicial members by the Judicial Council.  The Bill provides for one male judge and one female judge.  One of these judges will be a judge of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal or High Court and one will be a judge of the Circuit Court or District Court.  Of the two judges, one shall also have been a practising barrister and one a practising solicitor at the time of their appointment as judges.  I am confident that this latter aspect of the section will bring the understanding, knowledge and background of the relevant legal professions to the task of making informed recommendations when those judges are nominated by the council and appointed by the Minister to the commission.<\/p><p>On composition and gender balance, other than <i>ex-officio<\/i>members, I have provided for a male and female nominee of the Judicial Council.  Section 13 provides that the selection criteria shall have regard to the need that recommendations for appointment by the Minister of the four lay members comprise an equal number of women and men, as well as reflecting the diversity of the population as a whole.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the Bill provides for the two functions of the commission.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The first is the selection and recommendation to the Minister for Justice of persons for appointment.  For the international courts, recommendations concerning nominations to the Court of Justice and the General Court will be made to the Minister for Justice and nominations of persons for election to the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court will be made to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The second function concerns the matter to be dealt with under Part 5 on the preparation and publication of a judicial selection statement, which supports the function of making recommendations.<br\/><br\/>A number of sections can be highlighted.  Section 17 provides that commission meetings or meetings of a committee may be held remotely, which is an important facility for the body to have considering what we have just come out of.  Sections 22 and 23 are important accountability provisions relating to, in the first case, the director giving account to the Committee of Public Accounts on the commission&rsquo;s accounts and use of resources and, in the second case, the director being accountable to other committees of the Oireachtas for the general administration of the commission.<br\/><br\/>I want to ensure the commission has a particular obligation to set out its strategy for the achievement of the diversity objective set out in section 39.  In addition to the general scheme, section 28 provides that the commission will publish a diversity statement not later than two years after the coming into operation of that section and thereafter at least once in every four-year period.  The diversity statement shall include the procedures put in place to achieve the diversity objective, including how they will assist to remove barriers faced by persons who are under-represented in judicial office.  I carefully considered the outcome of pre-legislative scrutiny in this matter.<br\/><br\/>These sections of the Bill complement the commitments I have set out in Justice Plan 2022, which commits to bringing forward proposals to drive reform of legal education, which will include removing barriers to entering the legal profession, increasing diversity and introducing independent oversight of professional legal education for the first time.  Diversity in this context is in some respects a more complex and wider reaching issue than the commission can directly affect.  However, I anticipate that in line with these objectives, the commission will work with partners to break down barriers, increase the diversity of the eligible pool of applicants and encourage and support applications for appointment that would see progress in increasing diversity.  That is work in which the Law Society of Ireland and the Bar Council are supporting me.<br\/><br\/>Part 3 provides for the establishment of a Judicial Appointments Commission Office to be under the management and control of the commission and subject to the direction of the director of the office, to be appointed by the Minister under section 36.<br\/><br\/>Part 4 provides for the recommendation process and commences with section 39, which provides that the commission&rsquo;s recommendations will be based on merit.  Subject to that, three key objectives are prescribed of which the commission shall take account to the extent feasible and practicable: that membership of each court should comprise equal numbers of male and female members, reflect the diversity of the population and include a sufficient number of judges with proficiency in the Irish language to meet the needs of court users.  The Bill will give the task of selecting and recommending persons for roles in the Court of Justice, the General Court of the EU, the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court to the new commission.  <br\/><br\/>Section 40 specifies the qualification requirements for appointment and nomination and now includes some technical changes made by ministerial amendment in the D&aacute;il to refer, in the case of nominations to the Court of Justice and the General Court, to the requirements of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.<br\/><br\/>Under Chapter 2 of Part 4, the commission shall issue invitations by advertisement for the making of applications for appointment or nomination to judicial office, and a request to do so may be made by the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of the European Court of Human Rights and the International Criminal Court. <br\/><br\/>Section 43 makes clear that any person wishing to be considered for appointment or nomination must apply to the commission, and such application shall be made only in response to an invitation issued by the commission.  Section 45 provides for recusals from the commission where a judicial member or the Attorney General has made an application to the commission, and for the replacement on a temporary basis of a judicial member who has so applied.  Section 46 provides that the commission shall not recommend a person for appointment or nomination if he or she is not eligible, among other conditions, and unless the commission has interviewed the applicant.  Key elements of the process will be a requirement for interviews to be carried out and making training and continuous professional development mandatory for those seeking to be appointed to judicial office in the State.<br\/><br\/>Section 47 deals with recommendations for appointment to judicial offices in the State and provides that the commission shall recommend three persons for a vacancy and an additional two persons for each additional vacancy.  For two it would be five, and for three it would be seven.  The commission shall recommend less than the prescribed number where it cannot recommend that number, having regard to the suitability of applicants or the number of applicants.  The commission shall inform the Minister if it cannot recommend any person, and provide reasons in that matter.  All names of applicants shall be forwarded to the Minister.<br\/><br\/>The Government will not be able to appoint from a list of persons where there is no recommendation, but I believe the Minister for Justice should have a clear picture of the interest there may be in a given role and other information about the process, including an understanding of the diversity of persons making applications.  Similar arrangements apply under section 48 in respect of recommendations by the commission for nomination to judicial office outside the State.<br\/><br\/>Under the 1995 Act, a minimum of seven recommendations are made, not including expressions of interest from serving judges.  Obviously the numbers can be quite high.  I propose in this Bill to limit significantly the discretion the Government of the day has in relation to selection and appointment of judges.<br\/><br\/>Section 51 provides that only recommended persons shall be considered for appointment by the Government, and this applies also under section 52 in respect of nominations outside the State.  For a given appointment only three names will be submitted to Government, assuming the commission can make three recommendations, and Government choice is confined to those three persons. The 1995 Act requires the Government to first consider recommendations made by JAAB.  It is an important change, then, that Government may only appoint recommended persons.<br\/><br\/>Section 54 provides for notice of appointment to judicial office in the State to be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il<\/i>, while section 55 provides that the Minister shall provide an annual statement to the Houses of the Oireachtas concerning all appointments to judicial office in the State and elections outside the State where the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs made the relevant nominations.<br\/><br\/>Part 5 provides for the preparation and publication by the commission of a judicial selection statement and makes detailed provisions in respect of consultation in the matter.  The selection statement comprises a statement of requisite knowledge, skills and attributes under section 58 and a statement of selection procedures under section 59.<br\/><br\/>Under section 57, the statement shall be provided to the Minister within a period of 15 months from the commencement of the section, which period may be extended by the Minister by six months.  The commission is required from time to time to prepare revised statements for the purpose of replacing the initial statement and to publish the statements on its website.<br\/><br\/>The statement of knowledge, skills and attributes will be referenced against criteria set out in section 58, including relevant treaties, conventions and statutes with respect to judicial office outside the State, and relevant knowledge and experience at the different court levels in the State.  The requirement to have undergone particular education and training programmes or to have undergone judicial training is set out in section 58.<br\/><br\/>Section 59 sets out criteria for best practice selection procedures which are to be developed by the commission, including procedures for testing and interviews, and references, in the case of offices outside the State, to the relevant requirements set out by the relevant institutions.<br\/><br\/>The Bill makes particular provision to strengthen how courts are positioned to deal with the needs of those wishing to conduct their business in the Irish language.  Under section 56,  the commission shall consult the Courts Service about the needs of users of the courts with respect to proceedings being conducted in the Irish language and may request the Courts Service to produce a report in the matter.  The judicial selection statement must, in setting out the knowledge and skills required for judicial office, specify how these take account of the needs of such users of the courts.  Recommendations must take account of the need under section 39 to have a sufficient number of judges with a proficiency in the Irish language.<br\/><br\/>Part 6 expands qualifying grounds for appointment in section 63, so that for the first time service as a judge of the District Court will reckon as qualifying service for appointment as a judge of the High Court.  Legal academics working in specified educational institutions become eligible for the first time for appointment as a judge of any court, as do barristers in employment, that is, practising barristers as now to be defined for this purpose in line with the definition contained in the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.  The Bill also streamlines the process for assignments of District Court and Circuit Court judges in Part 6.<br\/><br\/>Section 67 provides that the Courts Service shall advance amounts for the purpose of expenditure by the Judicial Council from voted funds, and section 24 provides that the Courts Service shall advance funds to the new commission, as determined by the Minister.<br\/><br\/>Part 7 in section 68 provides for the dissolution of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.<br\/><br\/>The Bill is a comprehensive and positive contribution to overall judicial reforms and a modernisation of the courts system.  It represents a major adaptation and modernisation of the system put in place in the law under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995.  Other civil justice reforms such as the ongoing work of the Judicial Council, the reform of family courts, judicial planning work and the implementation of the Justice Kelly recommendations will, I am confident, improve the efficiency and outcomes of the administration of justice in our courts.<br\/><br\/>The joint committee pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme was an important contribution to the reforms.  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Lawless, the committee and other contributors to that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Helen McEntee:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I look forward to the debate in the House today and later.  I am happy to address any of the aspects of this reform that Senators may wish to raise.  I commend this Bill to the House. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#Z00400","speaker":"1502","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":130,"content":"<p>There is a lot to unpack in this Bill.  As the Minister noted, it is a significant change and there are significant elements in the changes that were contained in the Bill.  I echo what the Minister said about the quality of the Judiciary in Ireland.  We are tremendously lucky to have a Judiciary that is fair and more importantly, that observes the rule of law.  That is not even the case in every European country any more.  The fact that we have a Judiciary that does its job and does it faithfully to the Constitution and the law is something that is worth marking.<\/p> <p>Something we sometimes forget in this country and which is not part of the popular mind-set, is that the Judiciary is a branch of government.  Particularly in a common law jurisdiction, even though that may be a dwindling qualification in the context of the European Union, judge-made law is still a significant part of the law that operates on a day-to-day basis in this country.  Therefore who occupies those judicial positions is a tremendously important factor and there must be a democratic element of that the same way that the Executive, the Minister herself and her colleagues in Cabinet, are elected, albeit indirectly through the D&aacute;il and the Members of the Legislature are elected by the people.  The people have a direct say in those elections.  The say that they have in the appointment of the Judiciary comes through the Cabinet.  It comes through the Executive and that function is delegated to them by the people.  It is tremendously important that there is that democratic element in the appointment of judges because judges are a branch of government and they still have an important role, not just in the administration of justice but also in the making of law in this country.  That is an important point.  One of my concerns about this Bill is the provisions in sections 47 and 52 that, to an extent, abdicate that responsibility from the Executive to the judicial appointments commission.  Section 52 essentially states that the Government cannot appoint a judge if it has not been recommended by the commission.  I understand why that provision is there but we should also recognise that this is a highly significant change in the way that we appoint judges, lawmakers of one sort or another, to the courts in this country.  I hope it proves to be the right course of action but I think it is important to mark that we should have democratic input.  There is still a democratic input, obviously, because the Cabinet is ultimately making the decision but restricting the decision it can make to a fixed number of people appointed by a body outside the Executive is a highly significant change.<\/p> <p>On the commission itself, section 12 outlines who is on that commission.  I will say a few things on that.  The Bill is prescriptive as to who can be on that body.  Again, I understand why that is.  One of the most important functions I hope and believe this Bill will have will be to give people a public confidence in how our judges are appointed in order that there can be no suggestion, as there has been in the past and unfairly, that there has been any kind of undue influence put on the appointment of certain judges in certain circumstances.  You can pick any number of commentators who have said things like that in the past.  I think the experience we have had with our Judiciary and how excellent it has been on the whole belies that notion.  But if we can inject that element of public confidence through this Bill then that would be a good thing on the whole.<\/p> <p>I welcome that the Chief Justice will chair the commission.  That is important.  I welcome the fact that the Attorney General is on that commission although I note that he or she is a non-voting member.  When I say it is prescriptive, it is quite clear who is going to be there.  The provision in section 12(2)(b), which requires of the Judicial Council nominees that one will have been a former practising barrister and one will have been a former practising solicitor, to my mind is unnecessary.  I also think that it is foolhardy, to be perfectly honest.  It presumes that there will be an equal or even substantial representation by both professions in the Judiciary.  It is more important that the people who are represented on the commission are people who have experience of the courts.  That is why I also have difficulties with the amendments in respect of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, later in section 63, which inserts a new section 45A, that solidify the right, for example, of legal academics.  There are legal academics in this country who would make excellent judges and others who would not make excellent judges but a fundamental qualification of a judge is someone who has experience of how the courts operate.  The law is not something that exists only in books.  There is a procedural aspect to it that comes from the practise of law and it is a tremendously important aspect.  I am not sure that someone who does not appear in court or if someone is a legal academic who does not appear in court, will have the same breadth of understanding of that procedure that is a really important part of the day-to-day job of a judge.  In that regard I think it is regrettable that there is no provision for the legal professions, barristers and solicitors, to be represented on the commission.  This is not with a view to furthering their interests but with a view to having the benefit of the experience they have in court on a day-to-day basis, which is very important.  Practising lawyers in this country, no matter what level of court, District Court to Supreme Court and whether solicitors or barristers, have a very keen understanding of how the courts work and of who the personalities in the court system are.  That can be good and bad.  It should not rule the roost because of course there will be personality clashes and likes and dislikes and that should have no role whatever in these decision-making processes but, as we raised at the committee, there should also be room for people who have experience of particular practitioners to be able to bring the benefit of that experience to the commission, even as a minority voice within those discussions. <\/p> <p>Likewise, an earlier iteration of the Bill contained a provision for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to have the right to appoint a person to the commission.  There is a value in having that particular perspective represented within the commission to give it a flavour of the perspective of a statutory body that is looking at the administration of justice in this country and the making of laws, through judge-made laws, through the prism of human rights and equality which we know is an enormously important aspect of the courts system in this country.  We will have a chance to address this on Committee Stage, and the Minister will have given consideration to it already, but would she consider even at this stage, in the context of any future amendments, looking at IHREC's right or role in the judicial commission or those of the legal professions either?  There is some benefit to be had in respect of both.  <\/p> <p>There is obviously a large technical element to this Bill.  One thing it does is to set up a whole new agency to do this.  I acknowledge what the Minister said about the co-operation of the members of the JAAB and the bodies that precede the judicial appointments commission.  It is welcome that they have been of assistance here.  It is proper but it is also welcome and worthy of acknowledgement.  In a subtle way, the Bill provides for a significant transformation in the way that we appoint our judges. <\/p> <p>I welcome the Bill.  It is a good legislation because it clarifies issues that might have been open to interpretation in the past.  It will set them on the straight and narrow even if there are elements of it with which I disagree.  I acknowledge the fact that it is quite prescriptive and for a good reason.  On the whole it is good and solid legislation.  I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss the minutia in greater detail on Committee Stage and I look forward to that debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#BB00200","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and her officials to the House today.  I welcome that this legislation is being put before the House.  It is a huge improvement on the Bill which was debated at great length in this House before.  I should acknowledge that fact.  There are a number of issues, though, that I do want to raise.  One has been raised by Senator Ward, namely, that in effect, section 52 now says that a person cannot become a judge if a working majority on the commission decides that they will not become a judge.  Effectively we are giving to a working majority on the commission, which is effectively the Judiciary, a veto on anybody becoming a judge.  The Constitution talks about eligibility to become a judge.  This is not a question of eligibility because quite clearly, it is a question of a choice made by a number of people as to who is better than somebody else.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not a question of eligibility but rather one of discretion and opinion.  I share Senator Ward's concern that we have moved from what was in the previous legislation, which at least always acknowledged that the Government could, in the final analysis, appoint an eligible person to the Bench, to a situation where section 52, on the face of it, seems to prohibit that, and I think it is inconsistent with the Constitution to do that.  If, for example, the Attorney General reports to the Government of the day that a given barrister has been turned down eight times by the commission, which seems to take a poor view of him or her, I do not believe it will be prohibited by law from appointing that person no matter what its view of his or her merits may be.  There has been a change between the old text and the new text, and I think that text has a constitutional dimension to it that we cannot ignore.  If we are going to say a majority on this commission can veto anybody from becoming a judge, even though he or she may be eligible and even though the Government of the day might consider the person a very suitable person to appoint to, say, the Supreme Court, which is a very important court, and if it is to be able to do so constantly and without giving reason but simply by producing three other nominees, that is constitutionally doubtful, in my view.<\/p><p>I make that point not in a negative way but rather to note the change of tone with this Bill.  Section 52 may be simple, but it may be constitutionally infirm and simplistic if it has the effect of telling a Government of the day that four or five judges do not take a good view of a given person and that, therefore, it may not under any circumstances appoint him or her.  It will not do it in terms whereby it will say the person is unsuitable; rather, it will keep coming back with three other people every time and the name of the person in question will never appear on the list going to Government.<\/p><p>A point I raised on many occasions when the Bill of the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, was before the House relates to the problem with the rigid way in which the Bill, if enacted, will work.  If a vacancy appears in, say, the Supreme Court and a judge of the Court of Appeal is appointed to that position, a High Court judge will be appointed to the Court of Appeal, so there will be a trickle-down consequence over three, six or nine months under this procedure because each vacancy will not be created until the previous appointment has been made.  I raised this point previously and I know the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Flanagan, had to put up with me at great length in that regard, but we do not have to ignore it.  If each successive vacancy has to be advertised, interviewed for and filled, just a simple trickle-down of that absolutely classical kind will take the bones of one year.  We have to think very carefully as to whether that is a good idea, and there is a way around it.  There should be some system in the Bill for people, such as High Court judges, to apply to be interviewed, if that is required, and then to be \"on stock\" and available for recommendation, rather than have a particular vacancy arise and then require people who are already in the hunt to go through an entirely separate process.  I ask the Minister to take on board the fact that is going to be a serious problem with this legislation.  It will slow down judicial appointments significantly where that kind of situation arises.<\/p><p>Judges coming up to retirement frequently have to absent themselves from hearing a case because they know it is unlikely they will still be on the Bench when it comes to deciding the case.  An obvious way around this was proposed in one of the amendments the Independent Group of Senators tabled on the previous occasion, whereby judges would be allowed to finish their cases after their retirement at the invitation of the president of the court.<\/p><p>Lastly, I echo what Senator Ward said about the absence of people from the legal professions being on the council.  It is very simple to take them out, in order that any allegation of cronyism and so on can be easily rejected, but people have a great knack - especially unsuitable people - of appearing plausible to people who do not know them.  They can do wonderful things at an interview.  There are now thousands of solicitors and thousands of barristers and a growing population of more than 5 million, and the Judiciary will not know an awful lot of the candidates who are before them.  It is, in my view, a good thing that somebody would have a clear view of the reputation of the candidate, whether he or she is a crank, extremely unpleasant personally or whatever the case may be.  That kind of reputation is relevant to choosing a good judge.  To ask people on the basis of a plausible interview and a good paper CV to make an appointment ignores the opportunity, which I think is a valuable one, for a litmus test of whether the person is, by reputation, suitable to be on the Bench.  I think the Bill is deficient in that it excludes that possibility.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill and hope we will have good debates on Committee and Report Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#BB00300","speaker":"1669","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill, which is an important step forward in the reform of the judicial appointments process.  Having said that, it is important to acknowledge the process to date has served us well.  When enacted, the Bill will lead to the most significant reform in the way judges are chosen for appointment in more than a quarter of a century.  It is vital we have a clear process for judicial appointments that people understand and have full confidence in.  The Bill will allow for the establishment of a judicial appointments commission of nine members, chaired by the Chief Justice, to replace the current Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  All four lay members of the commission will be selected and recommended by the Public Appointments Service.  The Bill will ensure that anyone who wishes to be considered for appointment to judicial office, including serving judges, will apply to the commission and undergo the same application and interview processes.  Membership of the Judiciary should also reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, as the Minister outlined, and a new diversity statement will commit the judicial appointments commission to that objective.<\/p> <p>In summary, the Bill will provide for the establishment of a judicial appointments commission of nine members to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  The commission, under section 9, will be chaired by the Chief Justice and will have an equal number of judicial members, namely, the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal or the president of another court, depending on which court vacancies are being considered, and two Judicial Council nominees, along with the same number of lay members recommended by the Public Appointments Service and appointed by the Minister.  The Attorney General will be a member in a non-voting capacity.<\/p> <p>Some of the key improvements in the Bill compared with what was outlined in its general scheme include the discretion of the Government in the appointment of judges being significantly curtailed.  Judges will now only be able to be appointed from a shortlist of three drawn up by the judicial appointments commission, or five names for two vacancies or seven names for three, and only after an interview process.  This reflects a recommendation of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL.  In addition, it is very welcome that this new independent process will also apply to appointments to international courts. <\/p> <p>The general scheme had proposed a separate process for the appointment of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court, a process that would have required heavy Government involvement.  Following submissions by the ICCL and others, this proposal has been dropped and these positions will be filled in the same way as those for ordinary judges.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Robbie Gallagher:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is a highly significant improvement and means there will be one fair and merit-based process for all appointments.  A provision has been inserted in the Bill requiring all candidates to undergo judicial training or continuing professional development.  This again must be welcomed.<\/p><p>At a broad level, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill aims to regularise the process of nominating judges and implicitly reform the old process of getting the old tap on the shoulder from the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, or the Minister.  Notably, applicants cannot be invited to make applications as they can under the current JAAB process.  Furthermore, judges seeking promotion to a higher office will also have to partake in the appointments process, which is not currently the case.  The commission will be independent and have control over its own procedures, which is a necessary aspect of ensuring objective recommendations.  The formalised application process and selection statements will clearly assist in providing transparency for applicants and the public, who will know the general standards to be met in order to be recommended.  <\/p><p>The commission&rsquo;s main purpose will be to recommend to the Minister persons for appointment by the President to the Judiciary on the advice of the Government.  In a change from current practice, serving judges wishing to be considered for promotion to a higher judicial position will be required under the Bill to apply to the commission, as will any person wishing to be considered for appointment to judicial office.  The commission will set out best-practice selection procedures, including interviews, and the knowledge, skills and attributes required of judges.  There is provision for a dedicated support office headed by a director and staff.  It is also positive that the Government&rsquo;s discretion to choose judges is limited to those who are recommended by the commission.<\/p><p>Overall, it seems that the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill is a constructive attempt to reform the appointments process in Ireland.  Future judges will have the endorsement of their peers through the commission&rsquo;s recommendation and the formalised nature of the process brings greater transparency to appointments.<\/p><p>As I said at the outset, it is important that the general public has full confidence in the Judiciary.  We have been well served in that regard and it is very important that we make that point.  My two learned colleagues to my left have made the point that the input of professionals within the system is also important.  I would like the Minister to take on the points they have made so that those who make appointments can be best informed and advised by people who walk the walk and talk the talk every day in that particular field.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#CC00200","speaker":"1658","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":135,"content":"<p>The Minister is very welcome to the Chamber.

It would have a lay minority comprising only four of the nine members.  This is a significant departure from the then Minister, Shane Ross's Bill.  I personally welcome that.  I believe in a significant and genuine input from lay members but that the balance should be struck in favour of those who are on the front line day in, day out and who have more experience.<\/p> <p>There is a requirement that three candidates be recommended for each judicial post.  Senator McDowell has made the point that, under section 52, a person might be very eligible but never get to the next stage, his or her promised land.  Amendments may be brought before this House to address that without bringing it back to square one.  All of this would be for naught if there were an exception that could be used all of the time.<\/p> <p>There is another question with regard to the constitutional discretion of the Government and the reduction in the number of recommended candidates from seven to three.  There may be an argument that this overly restricts the exercise of that constitutional discretion.  At the end of the day, we are a sovereign State and the Government gets advice on these matters.<\/p> <p>The commission is to include the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, two members of the Judicial Council, two ordinary judges and the Attorney General.  I would have preferred the Attorney General to have a vote.  It is more than a symbolic role.  The Attorney General is leader of the Bar.  Advising the Government is a very high constitutional office and I see no harm in the holder being given a vote.<\/p> <p>When the commission is recommending candidates for the High Court, Circuit Court or District Court, the relevant president will replace the President of the Court of Appeal on the commission.  I agree with that because that president will know his or her court best.  However, an unintended consequence of knowing the court very well is that there may be a fantastic barrister or solicitor who has been on the wrong side of that president for many long years.  Section 52 may have an unintended consequence, as has been said.<\/p> <p>The Minister has taken on board some of the issues raised about the general scheme when it was published.  There were issues around the independence of the appointments process, diversity of appointments and the ongoing professional development of the Judiciary.  These have, to a large extent, been addressed.  The separation of powers and non-political appointments are things we can be proud of in Ireland.  It is welcome that the proposed judicial appointments commission addresses the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should reflect the diversity of the population as a whole in addition to gender equality and Irish language requirements.  We have made some progress in the Irish system but it is worth going further and realising that diversity will greatly benefit our judicial system.  It was said not too long ago that, when there were fewer High Court judges, they all happened to come from a small number of well-known schools.  They served the country fine but the court would have been enriched if there were judges coming from every parish rather than just a few well-known schools that have a fantastic tradition of producing judges.<\/p> <p>I will also raise the issue of encouraging more diversity.  This goes to the very heart of it.  It must start with the legal profession.  In an article about the Bill, Killian Flood raised the issue that it may be difficult to recommend people with a variety of backgrounds because of the relative lack of diversity among the population of lawyers within the State.  That is a very important point.  It is very difficult to conjure up diversity if it is not there in the first instance and if the body of people eligible for appointment does not represent full-blown diversity.  The sad reality is that, to this day, because it is so difficult to get through the Law Library while staying alive financially due to the challenging and impecunious nature of one's early days, people from less well-off backgrounds tend not to survive and thrive, although there have been notable exceptions.  The diversity required starts in the primary schools and secondary schools.  Although it was quite some while ago, for many a year, I streamed barristers towards visiting schools.  They were some brilliant schools but they did not have a judicial tradition.  I am talking about tens of thousands of students.  Law is not on the State curriculum.  Some students were unaware of the basic distinction between a barrister and a solicitor.  That has to be addressed.  Perhaps we should look at putting law on the curriculum to demystify the law in a fundamental way.<\/p> <p>In the time I have left, I will also briefly address the logjam of cases before the courts.  I welcome the extra &euro;12.5 million the Minister secured for the courts in the budget, bringing the total to &euro;176.5 million.  I particularly welcome the &euro;2.5 million to be used to support judges in clearing the backlogs exacerbated by the pandemic.  This will be of great importance.  It will take a lot of effort, time and money but it would be worth moving to a system in which judges do not, in most instances, proceed to hear another case until they write the judgment in the case they have just heard.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Vincent P.

We are waiting for unacceptable periods at times for judges to write judgments.  It is not a reflection on them but on their workloads.  They could have five or six judgments outstanding.  That is one small way to address the issue.  Another way to address it is to place more of an emphasis on their internal dispute resolution mechanisms.  I think of arbitration and mediation.  That would go some way to addressing the issue of too much automatic recourse to the courts when there might be a less expensive, faster resolution staring people in the face but they cannot see it.  The courts are not afraid of this.  Judges would be only too happy to steer more emphasis towards the option of arbitration or another alternative dispute resolution system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#DD00200","speaker":"1667","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.

Nevertheless, it is important we are back to debate it.  It is welcome that the Bill is before us.  I will not use all my time.  I will outline an overarching view of the Bill.  The thrust of my work will be when it comes to us on Committee Stage, which I will refer to briefly.  The Minister will forgive me for having to read my notes from my phone on this occasion.<\/p> <p>This Bill is about the long-overdue reform of the system used to appoint judges.  It proposes a raft of reforms which change the way in which judges are appointed.  For many years, previous Governments have shown little urgency with respect to implementing reforms that are needed to enhance public confidence in the independence of the Judiciary.  Before this Bill came before the Oireachtas, Fine Gael was in no rush to reform the appointments system for the decade or so it was in government.  It is important a level playing field is created to ensure transparency in the appointments process and that a mechanism is in place which keeps the Government's influence at a distance, with merit being the overriding consideration.  That is why the Joint Committee on Justice did not accede to the request to waive pre-legislative scrutiny, which is important.  Its position has been vindicated, since the Government tabled a number of amendments arising from the pre-legislative scrutiny, including a requirement that judges be interviewed, guarantees that anyone appointed has gone through the judicial appointments commission process, and that only a specific number of individuals can be forwarded for consideration.<\/p> <p>We tabled a number of amendments to the Bill in areas where it lacks, although none have been accepted until this point.  The speed of movement on this process reflects the pressure the Government has been under regarding the system and how it has operated.  Most important and worrying, the Bill still sees a role for the Attorney General in the judicial appointments commission.  This is where I diverge from some of my colleagues.  A group of academics, including Dr. Laura Cahillane, Dr. David Kenny and Dr. Tom Hickey, wrote to the Minister to advise her to remove this from the Bill.  The Bill does not have a cooling-off period for the appointment of an Attorney General to judicial office.  My colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, introduced a Bill to make the Attorney General ineligible for appointment to the bench straight after leaving office.  Given that we have seen two Attorneys General move seamlessly across, the Office of the Attorney General should be nowhere near this process.  I alert the Minister and her officials that Sinn F&eacute;in will table this amendment again in the Seanad.  We urge the Minister and colleagues in Government parties to reflect on and consider the merits of the amendment and to consider accepting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#EE00400","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":140,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister.

We are a little concerned about judicial independence.  We will seek to incorporate judicial independence, appointments by the Minister, and the Dublin declaration on standards and recruitment for the appointment of members of the Judiciary into the Bill on Committee Stage.<\/p> <p>The second issue I will flag is the appointment of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission as a nominating body.  The initial draft of the Bill guaranteed that human rights and equality expertise would be included.  That seems to have been scrapped in this version of the Bill.  We will table an amendment, as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission recommends, to ensure expertise is possessed by laypersons who can be appointed to the commission.  Without this guarantee, the Bill allows any layperson who is a member of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to be appointed regardless of knowledge and expertise.  We seek to amend that to ensure there is specific human rights knowledge and expertise among the laypeople who are appointed.  It is in the best interests of the judicial appointments commission to maintain this commitment to human rights and equality throughout its selection procedures.  This requirement is an addition to the Bill.  The amendment maintains the rest of the original text.  I will leave it at that, having flagged those amendments we will table on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#EE00800","speaker":"1672"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":144,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber for the second time today.  I have never spoken on this Bill but I recognise, as the barristers in the room have said, that we have a strong record of judicial excellence and independence.  This is about opening a more transparent process, which is welcome.  The Minister mentioned diversity many times in her speech.  It is obvious much thought has gone into this.  There is the diversity statement and two appointments from the Judicial Council, including one man and one women, while the lay members are to include two men and two women.  It is in that spirit I raise the concerns of the Irish Human Right and Equality Commission.  It was included in the general scheme and had the ability to appoint someone who would represent human rights and their protection and promotion.  Now, those four lay members will cover knowledge of and expertise in the justice system, business, corporate governance and human rights.  There is no explicit guarantee.<\/p> <p>The Minister said it would be important to have a more proactive and precise focus on human rights and equality and that they should be protected in this process, but it is not guaranteed as part of the appointments.  I feel it is a positive provision to have a lay member with that responsibility.  Judicial appointments are important and having somebody with oversight of diversity, gender balance and representation of minorities is important.  We recently heard from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission about its public sector equality and human rights duties under section 42 of the 2014 Act.  It would be a proactive step for the judicial appointments commission to meet its statutory obligation to fulfil those duties too.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  If the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission tells us it feels there is room for people's rights and equality to be strengthened, then we need to listen.  The general scheme suggested the appointment would be from its current membership.  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission suggested it is willing to look at that issue more broadly and that it could be an area for compromise.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Emer Currie:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I ask the Minister to reflect on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#EE00900","speaker":"1648","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":146,"content":"<p>As we have no further speakers, I ask the Minister to respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#FF00200","speaker":"1694"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":147,"content":"<p>I thank all of the Senators present and those who have left for their contributions to this Second Stage debate.  The Bill is an important part of my own justice plan, is part of the overall programme for Government and is part of the overall mission to build stronger and safer communities, which includes reform of the courts.  It is a key element of the democratic charter of the State.  Judicial independence safeguards a citizen's rights to have his or her own case decided on the law, the evidence and the facts without improper influence.  I believe that this reform will safeguard and enhance the continued independence of the Judiciary, which is vital.<\/p> <p>I will turn to some of the points that have been raised.  Obviously we can discuss any points in more detail and I will engage with Senators prior to Committee Stage.  I refer in particular to some of the points raised by Senators Ward and others about the reason for being prescriptive in section 52 in respect of who is appointed.  What I did not want was a commission comprised of 15 or 20 members, that is, a large number that would make it more challenging and feel unwieldy when it came to the commission making a decision.<\/p> <p>I appreciate there may have been some upset that the Bar Council and the Law Society were removed.  The reason that I was prescriptive in ensuring that we had a judge from a solicitor and a barrister background was to make sure that we still had that representation.  That is absolutely certain because it is really important to have representation from both sides when it comes to being on the commission itself.<\/p> <p>On legal academics being appointed, again that is why interviews exist, so it is not just to look at somebody's qualifications on paper.  Interviews are important to understand if somebody is appropriate or has the legal knowledge and an understanding of how the courts function, not just an ability to read.  Interviews are mandatory and will be part of this process, which is important.<\/p> <p>A number of Senators have mentioned IHREC and asked why it was removed.  There are other organisations that feel they should be represented, whether it is the ICCL or whomever, and by specifying one specific group, one then singles out others.  The Bill does not prohibit IHREC members from applying.  I am clear in setting out the criteria that there should be a human rights focus.  By singling out one organisation, which I appreciate is a very important organisation and does hugely important work to protect human rights, there are many organisations that feel they would have an equal reason for being on this commission.  It is important that we have a transparent process and make sure that when the Public Appointments Service, PAS, puts forward recommendations for laypersons, the human rights element is clearly taken on board.  I encourage members of IHREC and anyone who is part of that organisation to apply, thus ensuring we have such representation on the board.<\/p> <p>On what has been proposed as a veto, I feel and have set out clearly that it is a merit-based system and to get to that point, you will have to go through set criteria that will have to be published and clearly set out.  While there were nine members, there are eight voting members and there will have to be a consensus reached because it is four lay members and four members of the Judiciary.  Again, it will not be just the Judiciary deciding.  Obviously they will have a say but people will have to reach a consensus.<\/p> <p>The reason I have asked that the lists are still sent to the Minister is to ensure that if there is a situation where people who clearly have the qualifications are not coming through or are not being put forward, then that will be something that can be seen and the Minister can examine the matter.  If it is felt that changes need to be made or that the system and the process are not working in the way they should, then that is something the Minister can decide to change or amend at a later stage.<\/p> <p>In terms of delays, at the beginning of the year we opened up the JAAB so people can apply as vacancies arise.  It is not prescriptive in the Bill as to how the commission might do so.  It is within the remit of the commission to say at the beginning of the year that it will set a process and fill vacancies as they arise.  I will engage with Senators on this matter because I do not want a situation where a vacancy arises so we have to open a competition and there are delays.  People have engaged me on this matter where it has been made very clear to me that we need more judges, that positions must be filled quickly and that there are a lot of delays.  As I do not wish to delay this further, the commission has the remit and scope to set this out, which can be done at the beginning of the year in January and as vacancies arise.<\/p> <p>Senator Martin mentioned unintended consequences where there is potential for the relevant president to dislike somebody.  We must consider this matter from the point of view that the president will know who the judges are, the work that they do and, therefore, who is competent and who is suitable for a role.  We must examine this matter in a more positive way.  In any walk of life, there is a possibility that somebody will abuse their position but that is why it is important that the Minister can see, where names are coming through and where people are clearly suitable that if a problem is arising, it can be addressed.<\/p> <p>On education and diversity, I met representatives of the Law Society only yesterday and a huge focus of our meeting was on how we can attract a more diverse range of people into the profession.  The Law Society has done a huge amount of work on this matter.  I have also separately asked the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to consider expanding education and access to education because I believe that the two go hand in hand.  I think that the Senator is right that we need to start at the early stages and not when we are just selecting judges.<\/p> <p>On the Attorney General and the cooling-off period, I have worked closely with the current Attorney General and have seen the sacrifices people in that office make and the amount of time they put into the work.  As I said in the D&aacute;il, for somebody who puts himself or herself forward or is asked and accepts the prospect of taking on such a significant role but then to be disadvantaged because of it would, I think, be a huge turn-off for anyone to take on what is such a significant and important role in the Government.  The person would still have to go through the same process as anybody else but were he or she prevented from doing so because he or she had been a service to the State, I think very few people would take on the job if that is what they had intended later on in life.<\/p> <p>Again, the IHREC issue has been raised by a number of people.  Finally, on challenges and delays to the courts, as much as &euro;2.5 million of the money that has been allocated was to prepare the ground and lay the foundation for what I hope will be a significant increase in the number of judges.  I hope to get the Brigid McManus report in the coming weeks.  I also hope it will set out not just an increase in the number of judges but also where we can have greater efficiencies and perhaps change some of the work practices.  The solution is not just having more judges but it how they operate and function.  I look forward to receiving that report.<\/p> <p>I thank colleagues for their contributions.  Some of the points we can clarify.  Amendments will be proposed and I will engage with all Senators on them before we come back on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#FF00300","speaker":"1502"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664962200,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":149,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#FF00500","speaker":"1694"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":150,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#FF00600","speaker":"1653"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":151,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

Article 11 subsection (3) of the water framework directive requires all member states to implement measures to control the abstraction of freshwater, surface and groundwater and impoundment of fresh surface water.  The provisions of the water framework directive have not been transposed into Irish law and the Bill is a significant milestone in Ireland's overall environmental protection measures.<\/p> <p>Unfortunately, the absence of a comprehensive and modern abstraction-management and control regime in Ireland has led the European Union to open infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to fully transposed the directive.  Enactment of the Bill will form a considerable part of Ireland's response to these proceedings.  In general, abstraction pressures on our water environment are relatively low compared with some of the more significant pressures identified in the draft river basin management plan 2022-2027.  Detailed assessments of our water bodies by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the local authority waters programme, as part of our river-basin management planning cycles, will aim to refine and identify the more significant abstraction pressures.  This will give us a better picture of the nature of these pressures and the water bodies that are most affected.  Changes to our climate and meteorological pattern in recent years have also given rise to concerns over the management of our water courses.  Not only do we want to have waters of sufficient quality, but we also want sufficient quantity of water to supply our growing population centres and industries to help us continue to produce high-quality foods on our land.<\/p> <p>At a high level, the Bill provides for a modern registration, licensing and control regime for water abstractions.  Its focus is on the largest abstractions in Ireland as well as smaller abstractions that may cause short-term or ongoing environmental damage.  It is designed to be based on the risk of a water body not meeting the environmental objectives under the water framework directive and is not intended to control all abstractions.  This risk-based approach is in keeping with the principles of the directive and is similar to the approach taken in other EPA environment licensing regimes.<\/p> <p>The Bill also includes provisions relating to water impoundment infrastructure associated with abstractions.  For example, where a dam or other barrier interrupts the flow of a river for the purpose of abstracting water, the controls in the licence will extend to the operation of the impounding infrastructure.<\/p> <p>The most significant abstractor of water in Ireland is Irish Water.  A large proportion of the current registered water abstractors involve drinking water abstractions operated by Irish Water.  Provisions of the Bill will allow Irish Water to operate these abstractions within a framework that protects the quantity of water available and will ensure the EPA can regulate these abstractions appropriately.  In particular, the Bill will allow for a streamlined, comprehensive and robust application process for the water supply project from the Parteen Basin to supply to eastern and midland regions.  It will modernise the legal framework around significant abstractions and will ensure appropriate levels of oversight and control will be applied to that proposed abstraction.  I will now elaborate on the provisions of the Bill.<\/p> <p>It is a relatively detailed Bill comprised of 11 parts, 116 sections and one Schedule.  It is largely a technical Bill.  Part 1 covers sections 1 to 7, inclusive, and primarily addresses the general matters, including, the Title of the Bill, arrangements for bringing the Bill into operation and standard provisions.  Section 7 also includes some existing legislation that will be repealed to further strengthen the legal provisions of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Part 2 confirms regulation-making powers on the Minister to regulate unlicensed abstractions, including, abstractions below the registration threshold and those awaiting a decision on a licence application.  Local authorities will be responsible for ensuring compliance with these regulations under Part 9.<\/p> <p>Part 3 details the exemptions from the requirements of the Bill that may be applied by the Minister by way of regulations.  Part 4 includes sections 11 to 13, inclusive, and provides for the maintenance of a register of abstractions over the threshold of 25 cu. m per day by the EPA.  These provisions replace the provisions of the European Union (Water Policy) (Abstractions Registration) Regulations 2018, which will be repealed under section 7 of the Bill.<\/p> <p>Part 5 is the most substantial part of the Bill and sets out the principal licensing provisions for abstractions that require a licence.  Sections 14 to 20, inclusive, contain the main provisions relating to abstractions that require a licence.  These include the circumstances in which an abstracter is required to apply for a licence, the requirements of the EPA to assess these applications and the powers to grant or refuse a licence.  It also sets out the provision for the Minister to vary the thresholds for licensing.<\/p> <p>Sections 21 to 28, inclusive, address licence applications that require an environmental impact assessment, EIA.  These sections place particular emphasis on the procedures to be followed in determining an EIA, the level of detail required to make a full assessment and, most importantly, the co-ordination of an EIA between Environmental Protection Agency and the relevant planning authority.<\/p> <p>Sections 29 to 36, inclusive, relate to licence applications for abstractions that may be subject to retrospective environmental impact assessment.  A retrospective EIA is required in cases where the EPA determines that an environmental impact assessment was required and should have been made prior to or after the commencement of the abstraction.  For a variety of reasons, the EIA may not have been undertaken at the time when the abstraction commenced.  The process set out in these sections will ensure the appropriate environmental assessment is undertaken and all legal obligations are fully met.<\/p> <p>Sections 37 to 45, inclusive, provide for combined abstraction licence applications.  These applications comprise existing abstraction operating prior to the commencement of the Act and a revised abstraction that will increase the existing abstraction rate.  The purpose of these sections is to ensure a licence abstraction is sufficiently assessed in terms of any retrospective EIA and to provide for an equally robust assessment for the future proposed abstraction rate.  Such scenarios may arise where population-growth predictions will necessitate an increase in drinking water supplies.<\/p> <p>Chapter 5 of Part 5 includes sections 46 to 55, inclusive, and provides for a number of different requirements to complement the previous licensing sections.  These include provisions around applications for joint licences, surrenders, transfers, reviews, revocations and suspensions.  All these provisions are necessary to allow the EPA and licence holders sufficient scope to address changing circumstances as they may arise and enhance the ability of the EPA to manage the risks associated with these changes.<\/p> <p>The final elements of Part 5 cover sections 56 to 59, inclusive, which are miscellaneous provisions relating to licensing that provides for judicial reviews of decisions, regulation-making powers of the Minister, EPA guidelines for the licensing process and minor amendments to the licences.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Peter Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Part 6 focuses solely on abstractions by Irish Water.  Sections 60 to 73, inclusive, focus on the powers of Irish Water to make a public abstraction, provisions for objections to those abstractions, the process for An Bord Plean&aacute;la decisions and objections and provisions to address claims for compensation.  These provisions for compensation are likely to be used where people feel their rights in respect of water would be materially or adversely affected by a public abstraction by Irish Water.<\/p><p>Sections 74 to 82, inclusive, set out provisions for Irish Water to undertake temporary abstractions to supplement or replace existing abstractions on a short-term basis.  This may arise in the event of a severe drought, infrastructure failure or a contamination of a raw water source.  These temporary abstractions are confined to eight weeks' duration with the possibility of a single eight-week extension being granted.<\/p><p>Section 80 allows the Minister to make an order exempting a temporary abstraction from licensing requirements in emergency circumstances.  Any such order would only be considered on the basis of a civil emergency where the abstraction is for the sole purpose of responding to the emergency.  As with other temporary abstractions, the same eight-week time limit applies to an emergency abstraction under section 80.<\/p><p>Section 82 provides for appeals and compensation relating to Irish Water temporary or emergency abstractions.  Section 83 puts in place a framework for Irish Water abstractions from ESB reservoirs, with a particular focus on ensuring legal arrangements are in place between the parties before an abstraction licence can be granted.<\/p><p>Part 7 of the Bill relates to Waterways Ireland and its statutory functions and to abstractions from navigable waters and canals.  This part ensures Waterways Ireland has significant input into EPA assessments of abstractions from navigable waters operated by Waterways Ireland.  It also provides that any licensed abstraction from a canal can only be undertaken with the agreement of Waterways Ireland.<\/p><p>Part 8 comprises one section that addresses the operational safety of hydroelectric schemes.  It provides that the EPA shall have regard to the function of the ESB when considering an application for an abstraction licence associated with a hydroelectric scheme.<\/p><p>Part 9 contains the principal enforcement provisions of the Bill.  Sections 88 to 96, inclusive, set out the enforcement functions of local authorities and the EPA, including powers to appoint authorised persons to undertake enforcement actions.  Sections 97 to 102, inclusive, provide for the issuing of compliance notices and requirements on those who receive a compliance notice.  These notices can be issued by a local authority or the EPA for a number of offences, including abstracting water without a valid licence or breaching the conditions of an existing licence.  The notice can also require the owner of the abstraction to take measures to protect the environment or meet the environmental objectives of the water body concerned or both.  Sections 104 to 109, inclusive, set out the offences throughout the Bill, prosecution powers and the penalties associated with the conviction for an offence.<\/p><p>Part 10 contains four sections that relate to miscellaneous and transitional provisions.  The transitional provisions are in place to ensure the integrity of the legal framework following the commencement of the abstractions Bill and repeal of the Water Supplies Act 1942, certain provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 and the abstractions registration regulations of 2018.<\/p><p>Part 11 contains three sections that require amendment to the Canals Act 1986, the Shannon Navigation Act 1990 and the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The most substantial of these is section 116, which amends the Planning and Development Act.  The amendment insert references to water abstractions and the need for consultation in certain circumstances between planning authorities and the EPA, including on environmental impact assessments.<\/p><p>The Schedule lists the public authorities referred to in the Bill.  I thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny afforded to the general scheme of the Bill on 20 January 2021.

It is always welcome to have Bills initiated in the Seanad as opposed to by our colleagues in the Lower House.  I thank the Minister of State for this.  The Bill seeks to provide modernisation of the registering, licensing and control regime for water abstractions.  The Minister of State is right to point out that a detailed body of work was carried out by the Oireachtas joint committee on this matter.  It was thrashed out.  We had quite a lot of engagement from bodies on it.  It is true to say these bodies expressed some concerns about some elements of the Bill.

It is important that we update our legislation.  The existing regime is based on legislation enacted in 1942 and 1964.  I do not think any of us were around in 1942.  It is always appropriate that we update legislation.  We have obligations under the EU water framework directive.  The Minister of State will agree that is important we get the delicate balance right.  While we have to transpose water directives we must also ensure we get the balance right.  Legislation is always black and white and there are very few grey areas.  Sometimes we have to show flexibility in how we word it to ensure we get the balance right to protect our environment and look after those who are deserving of compensation where land is being sterilised or where there are crops.  I look forward to teasing out the Bill on Committee and Report Stages.

I am conscious he is a rural Deputy as well as a Minister of State.  He represents Longford and Westmeath where there are many farmers.  I will spend most of my time speaking about engagement with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA.  There was very little talk, if any, about the farming community in the Minister of State's presentation.  I will speak about this in some detail.  I have no difficulties with the Bill but I have issues with regard to adequate compensation and a framework for compensation for the farmers whom we, Government policy and the Minister of State value.  We need to see this reflected in the legislation and I will set out a number of reasons for this.<\/p> <p>I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its assessment of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Minister of State thanked the Oireachtas joint committee for its work in his speech.  The report from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service states 13 recommendations were made by the committee.  It states the key issues in two of the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations are reflected in the Bill.  It states the Bill may be described as adopting an approach consistent with eight more of the recommendations but it is still unclear.  The report also states the key issues in three of the recommendations have not been accepted or implemented in the Bill.  This is from the pre-legislative scrutiny and a bit of movement is possible.  As always, I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service team for its work, particularly on this Bill.<\/p> <p>As the Minister of State knows, and it is a well thrashed-out clich&eacute; although it is true, farmers are the custodians of the environment.  They understand their responsibility to comply with regulations and to protect and improve water quality.  Farmers understand that water is a critical natural resource for them.  It is a resource they need and it is consistent with the supply of their animals, crops and agricultural enterprises.  It is a given.  This is not the case for farmers alone.  Everyone needs water.  We need clean water coming in but we also need to be conscious of the water we flush out and its impact on the environment, human health, animal health and ecosystems.  We must balance all of these and be mindful of our international and European obligations.<\/p> <p>With regard to water abstraction compensation payments, the IFA states that where abstraction takes place on farm land and results in land sterilisation, crop loss and disturbance that fair and equitable compensation must be paid to the farmers.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Victor Boyhan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and have had a lot of engagement with the IFA, and I am also on the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The IFA has, over a long number of years, advocated for the development of an equitable national package of measures, including compensation to replace the <i>ad hoc<\/i>arrangements implemented by local authorities and Irish Water.  <br\/><br\/>The right to compensation is reflected in sections 14 and 15 of the Water Supplies Act 1942.  The Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill proposes to repeal the 1942 Act, including sections 14 and 15, and replace them with a provision which is more limited in scope.  The IFA has serious concerns regarding what is proposed in the Bill in terms of compensation, and we need to tease out its concerns.  The Minister will be supportive of that.  <br\/><br\/>This process is one in which we can tease out its issues.  That is important.  I seek to try to tease them out.  It will be a matter for all of us.  I have no doubt other Members across the House will have similar issues and concerns as we go through the various stages of the Bill.  The main concerns of the IFA include the limits of any claim for compensation to within two years of the authorised abstraction commencing.  It has stated that this would potentially allow the State to step aside from its existing obligations to farmers, resulting in a haphazard approach across the country by different local authorities and leaving many compensation issues unresolved.  <br\/><br\/>I told the IFA to identify both its problems and solutions, because we will examine them.  It proposed that we address removing the time limit on a claim of compensation or extending the period.  It went on to propose there should be an obligation on Irish Water to notify all farmers directly by registered post that they may be impacted by the process of water abstraction.  Farmers want to hear things formally, rather than hearing something on the road.  The IFA proposes a formal mechanism of communication and notification.  It stated that a national protocol needs to be developed, which sounds reasonable to me, and a package that resolves concerns regarding losses arising where abstractions are imposed on farmland.<br\/><br\/>The requirement to notify impacted farmers will enable them to engage with the planning processes and any other processes involved, and would facilitate and allow them to bring their views to the attention of the relevant agencies.  That is vital and I want to make that clear here today.  These are reasonable things.  It is about public engagement, knowing what is proposed and the outcomes and having reasonable negotiation.  Collective negotiation is more ideal.  It is very difficult to have single negotiations across acquisitions or any measures involving farmland.  There is, perhaps, a mechanism for dealing with that.  We have seen that with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and other bodies in respect of infrastructural projects.<br\/><br\/>The IFA has told me it is highly unusual - I also believe this - that when it comes to redress, the burden of proof of loss would be placed on individual farmers.  That is of concern to the IFA.  For example, Irish Water's sister company, Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, recognised from the outset that the loss exists and endeavours to address such losses through negotiation.  That is important.  The 1942 Act clearly sets out the relevant legislation for the determination of compensation.  However, this Bill provides no framework for the determination of compensation for farmers.  The Bill should be amended to address this and I will bring some reasonable amendments to the House for debate at a future date in order that we can have clarity about the existing frameworks were compensation and how they will apply in a practical sense.<br\/><br\/>There is also the issue of mediation.  Mediation is widely used and is an accepted alternative to a dispute resolution mechanism.  It should be pursued and we should make provision for that in the Bill.  For individual citizens such as farmers, mediation represents a more affordable mechanism.  We know the cost of courts and litigation.  It represents an affordable mechanism to arrive at an outcome where an agreement is not reached.  Mediation is an option we should consider.  The Bill should include an obligation on all parties to first engage in mediation by default.  Engagement is always active and never passive.  I support such a mechanism.<br\/><br\/>The Bill proposes to extend the powers of Irish Water to take a water supply beyond the land it owns or acquires.  However, it fails to adequately provide for the necessary package of measures and frameworks, including compensation, and such related powers, if exercised.<br\/><br\/>I have focused on the IFA and farmers but I did so because I do not think there has been enough debate about that.  We have not had an opportunity to debate these matters.  They do not come under the remit of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government; they are more pertinent to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine.  I have told the IFA we have to engage.  The Bill is essential and important, and we will try to put forward reasonable and practical amendments that I hope we can work collectively across the House to pass.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#PP00300","speaker":"1634","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for bringing forward this important Bill.  It is important, at a fundamental and basic level, that we responsibly manage our water resources in a sustainable way.  To do that, we need to know what is going on with them, how much water we are abstracting, where it is being abstracted and how it is being managed.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Members of the House, I welcome the Bill and we support it.  We particularly support the fact that the Bill aims to modernise and bring up to current standards the registration, licensing and control regime for abstractions of water.<\/p> <p>The proposed system in the Bill of registration and licensing is to be administered by the EPA, with local authorities also maintaining an ongoing enforcement role.  We welcome in particular that it will be a joint activity, and we believe local authorities have served us well in the past and can certainly serve us well into the future.  They bring institutional experience and have a track record, as well as having local knowledge.  We support local authorities' involvement in ongoing enforcement.<\/p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned how abstracts are currently being governed by outdated legislation.  The Water Supplies Act 1942 is 80 years old and the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 is almost 60 years old.  The world has changed so much in that time.  That is another good reason for us to support the Bill and, it is to be hoped, see it passed expeditiously.<\/p> <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, I have had the benefit of being a part of the pre-legislative scrutiny.

The committee specifically recommended that the threshold for registration be lowered to 10 cu. m and the licensing threshold be lowered from 2,000 cu. m per day to 20 cu. m.  This recommendation was considered and provision has been made in section 16 of the Bill for the Minister to have the power to specify or reduce the registration threshold and to specify or vary the licensing threshold for the purpose of the sustainable management of water resources.  We welcome that.  When the Minister of State is replying to the debate, it would be helpful for the House if he could outline how that might work in practice, whether it is he or any future Minister who holds office.<\/p> <p>The committee also recommended the removal of the provision in the Bill that did not allow an existing abstractor to be refused a licence.  This provision has been removed, which we welcome.  <\/p> <p>Provision in the Bill, in accordance with the committee's recommendation, has been made for the inspection application of remedial measures, the adjustment enforcement of remedial measures and the suspension and revocation of licences where the abstraction is not meeting the required conditions or abiding by the necessary regulations and guidelines.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is very important and it is important that it operates effectively.

This legislation is long overdue.  It is very important legislation.  It is crucial that we get it right and that the Government listens and takes on board the views of the Oireachtas and the joint committee, which I commend on its pre-legislative report, which I have taken the time to read in advance of today's debate.  The House will forgive me for holding out little hope, given that so much of the Oireachtas committee report seems to have been ignored in the drafting of the Bill, but we will be submitting amendments on Committee Stage that stay true to the advice of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.<\/p> <p>I particularly want to talk about thresholds, enforcement and the resources for enforcement.  From the outset, it seems that the Bill is letting everybody off the hook.  For example, licensing requirements only kick in at 2,000 cu. m and registration at 25 cu. m.  The committee report notes that all abstractions under 25 cu. m do not require regulation other than to abide by the general binding rules.  It notes that the approach in Scotland and Wales is 25 cu. m and the equivalent threshold in the North of Ireland for the registration of abstractions is 10 cu. m.  Why is there a departure from those jurisdictions?  Why not listen to the Oireachtas committee report?  Why not look at all-Ireland alignment?  Given that the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for modern legislation on licensing and control, surely the basing of thresholds on the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 is contrary to the aim of this Bill, given that it was enacted over 40 years ago.<\/p> <p>In simple terms, the proposed threshold for &ldquo;registration&rdquo; equates to approximately enough water to supply 42 households per day or to fill 104 wheelie bins per day.  That is a significant amount of water being extracted until registration kicks in.  Indeed, of at least 21 water bottling plants in the country, none of them pass the proposed threshold for licensing and only five of them extract enough water to even require registration.  It seems that everybody is getting let off the hook.<\/p> <p>There is also the combined cumulative effect of all of those who do not reach the registration threshold or the licensing threshold, and we will not have any of idea of the bigger picture when we take into account the cumulative effect.  In addition, these thresholds are a departure from recent trends across Europe.  Specifically, the registration threshold proposed is 150% higher than that in place in the North and in Scotland, and the proposed licensing threshold is 100 times higher than that in place in the North, in England and in Wales.<\/p> <p>I am particularly concerned as to the proposed Bill's compliance with Article 11.3 of the water framework directive.  This article presupposes an assessment of all abstractions to determine whether they are environmentally significant.  However, the proposed Bill will not require such assessment.  Can the Minister of State clarify how the agency will be able to determine if an existing abstraction of below 25 cu. m is causing a deterioration if it is not registered?  Second, how is this consistent with the Court of Justice of the European Union finding that member states must refuse authorisation of projects where a deterioration may occur?<\/p> <p>In terms of enforcement and review, we have concerns in regard to the enforcement of the general binding rules.  Specifically, while all abstractions, irrespective of their thresholds, are subject to the general binding rules, there is at present no provision or mechanism for the inspection of the general binding rules for any conditions surrounding the licensing requirements in the Bill.  Can the Minister of State clarify whose role it will be to enforce the general binding rules and what financial or other resources will be provided in support of this?  Who is going to be enforcing this and what resources will be provided to them to do so?<\/p> <p>I would like to express my concern as to the provision of adequate financial supports to ensure enforcement.  The EPA has previously advised that while it has sufficient resources in terms of its ability to prepare and analyse licensing, a gap exists in the resources to adequately enforce the requirements that will follow from the issuing of primary and secondary licences.  The committee previously raised concerns as to the lag between the introduction of legislation and the provision of resources needed to carry out the functions of that legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to indicate if he has engaged with the EPA to address this potential gap in funding and to clarify what the estimated cost of funding will be in the first year.  Second, can the Minister of State also clarify what additional resources will be provided, both financially and in terms of staffing, to local authorities to assist in the additional work that the Bill envisages for them?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#RR00200","speaker":"1686"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":168,"content":"<p>It is good that we are progressing this Bill.  As the Minister of State said, it is something we have been required to do by the EU.  We could have Seanad Chamber debates all day, every day on the water situation in this country, which we all know is pretty dire on so many levels.  I will stick to a couple of points.  In the programme for Government, we said we would fully consider the review from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities of Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed approach to water supply projects for the eastern and midlands region.  This review has not been published yet and I want to bring that to the attention of the Minister of State.  We need to focus on what we have committed to doing.  We have to ensure that Irish Water develops drinking water safety plans to protect abstraction sources and reduce public health risks, including trihalomethanes exceedances in treatment plants, which is also a big issue that we got handed as a Government.<\/p> <p>The Bill is welcome.  I want to outline a couple of reasons why abstraction has to be monitored.  In particular, large abstractions can lead to springs drying up and nearby wells emptying, as I have seen happen in my own county, higher pumping costs, subsidence, which we all know about, reduced river flows in summer, fish kills and saltwater intrusions that contaminate the groundwater.<\/p> <p>With all that in mind, I want to focus on one aspect of the whole thing.  We are talking about this big new plan that will cost millions of euro to take water from the Shannon to Dublin.  This is something we have to seriously consider.  An environmental impact assessment scoping report was prepared in 2016 by the project promoters but no actual assessment has yet been published to demonstrate the likelihood of significant impacts, such as ecological impacts, electricity demands and embodied carbon impacts.  None of that has been reported yet we just keep talking about it happening.  Maybe the people in Dublin think we are mad.  They need the water but there are other alternatives, and I do not think everyone in Dublin agrees with it either.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A matter that really worries me, which I raised with Irish Water, is that it has no consideration for investment in rainwater harvesting of any kind.  That is shocking.  There are grants available under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, for other agri-schemes for rainwater harvesting.  Not enough is being done to advertise that.  People do not know about it.  I worked with schools for many years and we got many schools to fit cubic metre tanks, which cost &euro;80 in the local co-op and hold 1,000 l.  They use them for grey water for gardening and everything else.  It is a bit like electricity - instead of putting the photovoltaic on and leaving the lights on all night, the first thing a person does is to turn off the lights.  It is the same with water.  Let us cut our demand for water in the first place.  Research carried out by a university in Dublin suggests domestic rainwater harvesting for grey water treatment could meet 94% of Dublin's water demand.  I have a scientific paper that proves that.  It is another good reason to ask why Irish Water is not considering rainwater harvesting.  It is crazy.  We have loads of rain in Ireland.  We have water shortages because rainwater harvesting is not being taken seriously on domestic or national levels.<\/p><p>Abstraction also has to be considered alongside the accelerating impacts of climate change.  Ireland is predicted to face increasingly hot and dry summers, with potentially serious impacts.  We may run out of water because no water has been saved.  Summers and the weather will change and have changed.  While we were discussing climate change, the climate changed.  It is insane that we have water shortages in a country where there is loads of rainfall.  Now, more than ever, this is very important.  I would love for the Minister of State to bring the point back to Irish Water, which is a State agency, that it has to take rainwater harvesting seriously.  Domestic rainwater harvesting could meet 94% of Dublin's water demands.  That is for grey water treatments.  We all know Irish Water is treating water that is then being used to flush toilets.  It is complete madness.  I have been to water treatment plants.  They cost loads of money and consume significant amounts of energy to pump the water.  Alternatively, we could have rainwater harvesting, although maybe not in every apartment in Dublin, but there is rooftop rainwater harvesting and nearly everyone I know has space for a cubic metre tank at the back of their house.  I have seen loads of houses where the householder has installed such a tank.  We need to up our game in that regard.<\/p><p>The last thing that is deeply worrying is that, in January, Irish Water will take over responsibility for all water from local authorities.  I am deeply concerned that the service in certain areas will be good, but Irish Water is taking over responsibility for all areas.  When a person phones about a leak, in some cases the council says it is its fault, whereas in other cases the council says it is the fault of Irish Water but Irish Water says it is the fault of the council and it slips between the cracks.  The bottom line is that if Irish Water is taking over water in January, we need to demand that it starts looking at the research that has been carried out and takes rainwater harvesting seriously instead of considering taking water from the River Shannon.<\/p><p>I welcome the Bill and the Minister of State's work on it.  As previous speakers stated, we need enforcement.  Rainwater harvesting could solve many of the problems, however.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#RR00300","speaker":"1659","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":170,"content":"<p>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome to the Gallery Senator Pauline O'Reilly, her mother, Carmel, and her aunts Pauline and Harriet.

Like those who have spoken before me, I wish to put on record how welcome it is that we are finally updating a legislative framework for the abstraction of water in this country.  This legislation has been much delayed.  Maybe the Minister of State can tackle the equally archaic and environmentally devastating Arterial Drainage Act next.<\/p> <p>To get back to the Bill, we know the absence of coherent and comprehensive regulations on water abstraction is in breach of the water framework directive.  If we get this legislation right, we can rectify that situation and ensure we are compliant.  Of course, it all depends on us getting this right.  The implications of this legislation are significant.  I hope the Minister of State will confirm that the Seanad will be afforded ample time to give the Bill the proper scrutiny that it warrants.<\/p> <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill and produced a report, the sensible recommendations of which have been referred to by some Members.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has analysed how the draft Bill has reflected those recommendations.  Unfortunately, it states that only two of the recommendations were fully incorporated into the Bill.  I request that, before Committee Stage of the Bill in the Seanad, the Department of the Minister of State furnish the Seanad with a memorandum outlining which recommendations from that pre-legislative scrutiny report it perceives as having been taken on board and the rationale for not incorporating any recommendations that have not been included.<\/p> <p>This is important legislation because we currently have no way of recording and properly monitoring the levels of water abstraction that are taking place.  As other Senators have stated, that is in breach of the water framework directive, but it also leaves us exposed to environmental damage and potentially negative social impacts because the overabstraction of water can lower downstream water volumes, change the flow dynamics, alter storage capacity and impact on water quality, which then has knock-on impacts on human health, as well as on plants, animals and freshwater habitats.<\/p> <p>I will outline some of my immediate concerns.  Maybe, after clarification from the Minister of State, some of them will be allayed.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, outlined the concerns of Sinn F&eacute;in regarding the threshold levels, which are completely out of kilter with what is being proposed in other jurisdictions, including the north of this island, in terms of what is eligible for registration and licensing.  The pre-legislative scrutiny report called for 10 cu. m for registration and 20 cu. m for licensing, whereas the Bill proposes excluding anything below 25 cu. m for registration and only requiring licences for 2,000 cu. m of water.  That seems completely out of kilter.  Why has the threshold been set so high?  Why are the Minister of State and his officials ignoring the recommendations of the joint committee in respect of those thresholds?  The thresholds also appear to contradict the view of the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA.  It has stated that a threshold of 25 cu. m would make it impossible for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to determine if there is any deterioration in the status of the water bodies that occurs at those levels.  In fact, the OPLA stated it believes the Bill as it stands is inconsistent with the water framework directive and the environmental impact assessment directive because it does not allow for assessment of existing abstractions below 25 cu. m or proposed abstractions below 250 cu. m.  The thresholds appear to be arbitrary and solely based on size.  Why has the Minister of State settled on those thresholds?<\/p> <p>A second area of concern is the regime for existing extractors.  While we understand the application for existing extractors to regularise their activities might need to be different, there cannot be any justification for different standards.  Existing extractors seeking to regularise their activities must be subject to the same standards in respect of environmental impact assessments, EIAs, and public participation.  Will the Minister of State confirm there will not be a two-tier system in the application of this law?<\/p> <p>There are also issues relating to licences of indefinite duration and there appears to be no facility to pause a licence on environmental grounds.  I am seeking clarity on that.  I have questions regarding the exemptions and the extent of the power the Minister of State appears to be gifting himself through the legislation.  Why is there a section granting the Minster powers to grant exemptions?  What forms of water abstraction and which organisations are being deemed to be exempt from licensing requirements?  On what grounds or criteria will that assessment be made?  How will it be ensured the exemptions will be compliant with the water framework directive?<\/p> <p>The Bill contains a section on Irish Water.  What is the purpose of that section?<\/p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will address the concerns that have been raised.  Senators want to work constructively with him.  It is essential we get this right.  All present agree it has to happen.  Only this week, however, the EPA was before the committee and issued a stark warning on the challenges we face in meeting our water framework directive targets.  Other Members mentioned the impact of decreasing water quality and climate change, which brings its own challenges, but the more we know about our water, who is taking it and what is going into it, the better we can manage that resource for the benefit of rural and urban communities and wildlife.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For too long, beverage and agrifood companies, such as Diageo and Glanbia, have exploited our water resource without the proper licensing and oversight.

However, as I said, it is vital that we get it right.  We cannot cut corners or turn a blind eye to some industries&rsquo; abstractions.  We cannot ignore our legal obligations under the environmental impact assessments and the water framework directive.<\/p><p>I hope the Minister of State will be able to answer my concerns.

As the legislation progresses through the House, we will be happy to work with Senators to try to reflect many of the contributions that were raised in the legislation.<\/p> <p>I wish to point out initially, in relation to the pre-legislative scrutiny report, that the Department took on board suggestions therefrom.  It was a catalyst to respond to some of the key changes that were in the legislation.  Some of the recommendations from the report may not be in it word for word, but they clearly informed the response to draft the legislation.  We will commit to prepare a report on the pre-legislative scrutiny report for submission to the Seanad to explain how we were informed by the issues raised within the report, how we responded to that and how they were a catalyst to assist us.  <\/p> <p>The constructive debate that we had today follows on from the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, as I referenced, that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage gave to the general scheme of this Bill more than a year ago.  I fully appreciate the support that has been expressed by some Members for the Bill.  We are happy to have the opportunity to work with the Seanad before the Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill 2022 is enacted.  <\/p> <p>The purpose of this Bill, as stated, is to set out the controls on the abstraction and impoundment of water, to protect our water environment and to ensure compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s responsibilities under the water framework directive.  The focus of the Bill is on the largest abstractions in Ireland and those smaller abstractions that may be causing short-term or ongoing environmental damage.  The Bill will ensure that our surface and ground waters are carefully managed to prevent risk of over-abstraction and provide the Environmental Protection Agency with the powers to operate a modern, risk-based licensing regime.<\/p> <p>The Bill delivers one of Ireland&rsquo;s key responsibilities under the water framework directive.  At a time of changing climate and uncertainty over the sustainability of our drinking water resources, the Bill will ensure our most valuable natural resource is protected into the future. <\/p> <p>I wish to respond to another few points that were raised.  Senator Garvey raised the issue of harvesting.  We will raise that point with Irish Water and it is a sensible one.  Senator Fitzpatrick raised the issue of thresholds.  These thresholds will obviously be risk-based.  That is the key thing in relation to the setting of them.  If the EPA recommends any changes regarding the thresholds, we can then do that.  It would be in its hands to recommend that.  On Senator Warfield&rsquo;s point on abstractions and local authorities, they will be enforcing them.  As a reference, as part of the EPA, the local authority assessments will be carried out on water pressures that will be identified through the various different bodies.  As I outlined, it will be risk-based. <\/p> <p>In addition, I committed to doing the report for the pre-legislative scrutiny and any other issues.   I want to assure people there will not be a two-tier system of licensing and licences can be suspended on environmental grounds.  <\/p> <p>We can respond to specific points other Senators may have raised.  We are happy to organise briefings within the Department through the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to achieve a balance for people so they fully understand and appreciate what we are trying to do.  Critically, the most important point is that we absolutely took on board the joint committee pre-legislative scrutiny report and that was a catalyst for many of the actions that were taken in this legislation.  We are happy to do a report for the House on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#TT00200","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1664962200,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":175,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to take Committee Stage?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#TT00400","speaker":"1650"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":176,"content":"<p>Next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#TT00500","speaker":"1647"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Is that agreed?

I thank the Minister of State for joining us for tonight's debate and welcome the opportunity, alongside colleagues, to speak in the debate and to move the motion.  In doing so I will give the Minister of State, so he has a clear understanding of where I am coming from, a little context.  It was actually the Minister of State's party colleague and my Seanad colleague and friend, Senator Wilson, who tabled a motion exactly the same as this one.  That motion received cross-party signatures in the Seanad.  We had signatories from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independent Group.  That motion was submitted in June of this year.  It is identical in its wording to tonight's motion.  I understand the competition there is among the larger groups for Private Members' business slots, and there is competition among the smaller groups for such slots as well, so I am really happy my colleagues in the Seanad agreed we could use our Private Members' time to move this motion because it is an important one.  I think I am right in saying the Minister of State has been before the Seanad to take Commencement matters on this issue from me in the past.  Certainly, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has done so numerous times, in both the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-fifth Seanaid.  Before him, the former Minister, Deputy Flanagan, also often did so.<\/p> <p>There are a couple of important points to make about this issue.  I say all this in a non-party-political and non-ideological way.  I say what I am about to say tonight and in every debate on this issue in the context of services, the need and demand for services and the expectation that they be delivered in an accessible and tangible way to people closest to where they need them.<\/p> <p>For the first time ever, last year, in the North, and this is significant, more people applied for an Irish passport than for a British one.  That is indicative of the steady, if not sharp, incline in applications for Irish passports, particularly after Brexit.  I always think of an anecdotal story when talking about this issue.  The morning after the Brexit result, my local post office, in the staunchly loyalist and very proudly unionist and loyalist community of the Lower Newtownards Road, ran out of Irish passport applications.  The recent census figures in the North showed a 63.5% increase in Irish passport holders there.  The Minister might say - and he would have an argument but I would have a counter - that all those figures show that the passport service is working fine and does not need any additional infrastructure or improvement.  He might say that post offices across the North offer a passport express service and that that is sufficient.  However, many colleagues have experienced similar issues in their constituencies right across the island.  We know that when there has been a problem, it has been proven that there have been delays.  There has been a particular problem with either the applicants themselves or us as political representatives being able to get through to speak to a human being.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There is an issue in the North in particular, because of the nature of the passport express service through the post office.  While it is a very pleasant and efficient experience to submit your paper copy of an application at the post office, and I do not deny that, if you encounter a problem or an issue with your application, you cannot go back to the post office and ask to speak to someone about your passport application, if it has been delayed and if you cannot get through to the Passport Office.  The post office staff will just look at you and say that they cannot help with that; the application is gone in.  <\/p><p>All of these issues indicate the clear rationale and clear need for a passport office in the North.  I was very happy to sign the previous motion that was tabled on a cross-party basis.  I am not hung up on where such a passport office is located.  A lot of people west of the Bann would make a very justifiable and understandable call, given the deficit of service infrastructure there, for an office in that area which could service not just Derry, Coleraine, Omagh and Strabane but also Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and further afield.  The real issue here, as shown by my own online petition which has over 32,000 signatures, is that an office in the North is needed.  <\/p><p>What I am always conscious of and very careful about is acknowledging the absolutely fantastic work of the Passport Office staff.  It was a particularly difficult time during Covid, when services were reduced right across various sectors but people stepped up and did great work.  It has not been easy.  Like many colleagues across the Chamber, I have dealt with lots of emergency situations and the people in the Passport Office have been extremely helpful, attentive and understanding in bringing a resolution to peoples' particular issues.  That is really fantastic and is very much appreciated by me and by the people on whose behalf I make representations.  Alongside that, however, there are many experiences where that has not been the case.  That is not the fault of the Passport Office staff and by no means am I suggesting that it is.  Part of the rationale for calling for investment in further services and infrastructure is to lift the burden on existing Passport Office staff, to spread and share the load and to ensure that the staff in existing sites and locations are not dealing with the huge volume of applications we have seen in recent months and on various sporadic occasions over the last number of years.  <\/p><p>Another issue that I raise quite regularly in this House is Article 2 of the Constitution, which talks about the right and entitlement of everyone born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation and probably the most common expression of that is the holding of a passport.  I also make the case quite regularly that the Government must give effect, in a more tangible way, to that article of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  Irish citizens, no matter where they are on this island, deserve services.  They deserve the ability to be able to engage with a human being.  Many times people have said to me that if someone could tell them that their application will take six weeks and they know that, then they would be okay.  The problem is that they have spent hours and hours on the phone or on the webchat and have not been able to get clarity.  A lot of this is about ensuring that people have the opportunity to go in and speak to a human being about their particular case.  <\/p><p>In our budget submission, Sinn F&eacute;in has allocated finances for the opening of a dedicated branch of the Passport Office in the North.  People pay for this service and that is an important point to remember.  When they pay for a service they should be given the highest standard of service.  An Irish passport is a very precious, important and symbolic document.  We all value it, what it gives to us and what it means for us internationally.  All I am arguing for and all that this motion argues for is that we would improve on foot of the lessons learned.  I ask that we would learn from our experience, particularly over the past number of months, and hear the calls for greater collaboration, greater sharing of resources and infrastructure across our island and ensure that people have the opportunity and the ability to avail of an important investment by the Government, not just in an office and in passports, but in people, an investment that says to them they are valued and are part of the Irish nation.  The Government can show people they are valued by investing in an office where they can go to avail of one of the very fundamental, important and basic rights and entitlements.  <\/p><p>I hope colleagues will support this motion.  I am absolutely certain they will not oppose it.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of colleagues and to concluding tonight's debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#YY00400","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":185,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  My colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, has outlined clearly why a Passport Office branch in the North makes sense.  In 2020 the number of Irish passports being issued in the North surpassed British passports for the first time.  A total of 48,555 citizens applied for a British passport, which was 356 fewer than those who opted for an Irish passport in the same year.  Since then, the gap has become even more pronounced, with the number of applications for Irish passports more than double the number for British passports in January and February of this year.  In the context of those figures, if the British Government can run a passport office to service a smaller number of passport applications, then surely our Government should be looking again at the proposal for an Irish passport office in the North.  We have a branch of the Passport Office in London, I believe, in recognition of the large number of passport applications that come from there.<\/p> <p>Last night there was a debate in Newry, Mourne and Down District Council about the need for an Irish passport office.  The motion tabled enjoyed cross-party support with a majority of 27 in the Chamber from Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, and Alliance voting in favour, while Derry City and Strabane District Council has already passed a motion calling for the same.  Again, as Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has pointed out, our Private Members' motion has been co-signed by Members from across this House.  There is huge cross-party support for the idea of a passport office in the North and now we just need to make it happen.  <\/p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has long campaigned on this issue and his petition has over 30,000 signatures.  Apart from the point about the need for a Passport Office branch, given the level of demand, there is also the issue of practicality.  We all know that applying for a passport is great when one can go online or into the post office.  There have been reports of people receiving their passport the day after their application was submitted.  However, when the process goes wrong it is a very different story and one needs to be able to attend at an office to get things sorted.  Currently people from the North, as well as from Donegal or Sligo, have to travel to Cork or Dublin to get issues resolved.  <\/p> <p>I am not the only one whose soundtrack to this summer was the waiting music of the Passport Office.  A lot of us in this Chamber had that tune in our heads and probably still have nightmares about it.  That said, when we got through to somebody, the service was excellent.  There were many heartbreaking stories but the vast majority of the cases I dealt with involved people from the North who were in a panic trying to get their passports.  As has already been pointed out, there are complications when one is dealing with two different postal services.  Another Passport Office branch would add extra capacity and would allow people to get reassurances when applications go wrong.  As I said, the staff at the Passport Office were great, given the pressure they were under but when I was talking to people on the phone who were very anxious about whether they would get their passport on time for a wedding, or in some cases for a funeral, they often spoke about the different experience when applying for a British passport, which would take three weeks.  They knew they would get it in three weeks.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Boylan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->People who identify for Irish citizenship deserve a similar treatment.

I am pleased to see that there has been a huge turnaround.  Someone very close to me put in an application online on a Friday and it arrived in the post on Monday, which is a remarkable turnaround time.  I pay tribute to the Passport Office for listening to the concerns raised by Members in both Houses.  Extra staff were put in, they made a real effort to deal with Members, there was a special line for us, and that in itself shows that the office was listening to the concerns.  I am disappointed that there is not a piece in the motion looking for a passport office in the west as it is another region of the country where there is no passport office. That is not to take away from the points raised by my colleagues about Northern Ireland; just a point to note.  For people in Mayo, where I live, we travel to Dublin if we need an emergency appointment, which is a lot further than getting to Dublin from any parts of Northern Ireland.  We are moving into a digital age. In excess of 90% of applications go in online, perhaps even 97%.  Therefore we have to justify the cost of opening an office as well.  If everyone is online and an office is opened, that is being paid for out of the Exchequer and people's taxes.  Nobody using it would be a waste as well.  It will be interesting to hear what is the cost involved will be; where it will go; what the usage might be given the number of applications that go in online.  We have to bear in mind that people in lots of parts of the rest of the country still have to travel considerable distances for that emergency application, if and when it does arise.  To be fair, those appointments are now easy enough to get and the turnaround is pretty good.  There will always be that small percentage where the turnaround has not been fantastic but by and large, today it is a very good service.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#AAA00400","speaker":"1642"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":190,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am a huge supporter of the motion and it is very simple for me.  It is this island's second city and I support the motion and always have done.  I am biased, being from County Louth and living between the two capital cities of this island, I believe we should have a passport office in Belfast.  I am more prescriptive than the Senator who mentions anywhere in the North but I say it should be in Belfast.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile put out all the practical reasons.  We spoke about the demand and the efficiencies that could be made; again all very practical issues.  Other Senators spoke about the symbol of the Irish passport and for me also, when I got my passport on my first trip abroad when I was 17, it was a big deal.  I was very proud to get my Irish passport.  I still have my very first one in the drawer.  It means a lot to me.  That symbol and symbolism in general, is very important on this island.  There is an argument for it because of that huge symbol and it is important that we have a passport office in Belfast.  I follow on from other work my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I, as well as my Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, colleagues, have been doing in calling for the franchise for the presidential elections to be extended to people in the North.  According to our Constitution, they are entitled.  They are Irish citizens and I fundamentally believe that that referendum and Bill should be moved to extend that franchise to our citizens, friends and family in the North and have their votes heard in the next presidential election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#AAA00500","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Hear, hear.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#AAA00600","speaker":"1688"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":192,"content":"<p>At the outset, I congratulate Senators &Oacute; Donnghaile and Boylan for bringing forward this important matter. It is an important discussion that should be held in the Seanad.  Well done to them on that.  We will not be opposing the motion, as was anticipated correctly.  We have no difficulty with this at all, in principle or in practice.<\/p> <p>The first thing I raise is that I assume this office would be available to people in Ulster generally, and not just in the Six Counties that constitute Northern Ireland?  It would be important for people in Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal and indeed Louth, to be able to access the office and use it.  I presume the Minister of State will indicate his support for that to ensure we vote for or not oppose the motion.  It is important that we do that. I have said privately to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile in the past that we should have much more interaction.  We should contrive to make reasons to bring people north and south in this country.  That is very important and this could be one way.<\/p> <p>I agree with Senator Chambers regarding Mayo.  Why not put a passport office into the west of Ireland?  I presume that in no way thwarts the other.  I wish to bring a perspective on how successful the passport situation has been.  We have had the difficulties but great strides have been made and it is important to draw attention to this.  Up to mid-July of this year, 720,000 passports have been issued.  That is in contrast to 630,000 in 2021.  The numbers are 20% up on a peak year in 2019.  There has been a 40% increase in the online time, certainly for renewals anyway.  Currently, 6,000 passports a day are being issued.  There is a ten-day delay online for renewal and that is not bad.  Since June, 570 new staff have been recruited into the Passport Office.  These are good things.  That it is not to suggest there was not a problem but the Government is addressing the problem with vigour and with a huge amount of success.  It is wonderful on a number of levels that we had the inundation of applications for passports.  It is great to see people from Northern Ireland and the UK seeking Irish passports.  That is just wonderful and something to be very proud of as a country.  We have come a lot way to have reached that point and that is good.  It is wonderful to see those requests and demand levels.<\/p> <p>It is also wonderful to see the mobility of our people now and the degree to which people are fit to travel.  Travel is so much part of the reality of people's lives.  Senator Craughwell and I occasionally reminisce about life when we were younger and talk about how it might not have been as ideal as we like to romanticise it retrospectively.  We have had those discussions in the House a few times.  Looking back to my childhood, air fare was prohibitive for most people.  It was a very rare thing for people to go on holidays and for long-term, even successful emigrants, to get home; particularly if they were in America or beyond the UK.  It is great progress and is great to see mobility among people travelling and people living in a wider world, landscape and experience.  That is good.  It is good to see the demand for passports and that we are addressing that demand, as we should.  <\/p> <p>To return to the core of the motion, neither I nor my party have any problem with the motion.  There will be at least one further speaker who will indicate similarly.  We will be supporting the motion.  It is a good motion.  It should be done, by the way, and not just be a motion of the Seanad.  I would like to hear the Minister of State give a commitment to do something about it because it is a worthy measure.  I acknowledge there are issues around viability as a certain volume is required to be viable but the cloth could be cut according to the measure and have a small office.  Some elaborate monstrosity of an office would not be needed if you are not going to have the kind of volume that would justify that.  That kind of office might only point up the lack of activity in it so you would be better with a small physical office that was busy than a large building that was not.  <\/p> <p>It is a good motion and a good discussion.  The Seanad is addressing a real issue which could be good if it also caused a greater movement.  Something I personally will come back to and have a big thing about is mechanisms to bring people up North.  We should do it through the sports capital grant, through a number of mechanisms and ways.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Joe O'Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Movement north is very important for southern people and there is not enough of it.

The proposer of the motion cited Article 2 of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and other contributors have referred to the symbolic nature of the motion, as well as the substantive point.  Article 4 of the Constitution states &quot;The name of the State is <i>&Eacute;ire<\/i>, or, in the English language, <i>Ireland<\/i>.&quot;  Article 5 of the Constitution proclaims &quot;Ireland is a sovereign, independent, democratic state.&quot;  The Constitution establishes a polity that can be safely described as republican just as France or the United States are republican.  This fundamental legal position of the State can only ever change by way of referendum.  In 1948, on the enactment of the Republic of Ireland Bill the State was described as a republic.  The Act went further and its section 2 declared &quot;that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland&quot;.  The designation, &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; under statute law is not the name of the State, which is confined to the Constitution's definition, namely, Ireland, or &Eacute;ire.  &quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot; is not the name of the State; Ireland is her name.  Why then the necessity to create this distinction and ascribe the State a name that is not hers?<\/p><p>The description, &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; is not all-island inclusive.  It reinforces two islands, two Irelands and a them and us, while &quot;Ireland&quot; is inclusive because we are all Irish.  Ireland is the land of green and orange.  It is our common home and our common and shared birthright.  The new generations of Irish who come here from all over the world do not come here to the Republic of Ireland but come to Ireland, where they live and make their home.  The year 1948 was a long time ago and a very different time in our State's young history.  It was a period when our new State shifted further from the people of Northern Ireland.  The outbreak of violence strengthened, solidified and defined that divide.  The legislators of the 1940s hardly envisaged the recent census statistics published in Northern Ireland that show the number of Catholics exceeding the number of Protestants for the first time.  Nor could those legislators have foreseen what happened in 1998, when the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by a majority of people on the island, North and South, the people in the Republic voted to give up its territorial claim to the Six Counties and all embraced a consent principle of recognising the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland to decide its own destiny.<\/p><p>In the 1980s a young boxer from Clones gave us a glimpse of what normalised life could be like when people from the Falls Road and the Shankill Road came together to support Barry McGuigan.  They parked their often-deadly political differences to cheer on one of their own.  Recently, Kildare's popular Eric &quot;Lilywhite Lightening&quot; Donovan heroically won a prestigious EU boxing title in Belfast against Frenchman Khalil El Hadri.  However, Donovan was introduced in Belfast as a boxer representing the Republic of Ireland.  Imagine if he had been introduced and announced as representing Ireland, which, as a matter of constitutional fact, he was.  The attendees in Belfast who were from Northern Ireland and the thousands more watching live on television throughout the island, especially those from both traditions in the North, would perhaps have felt an even closer affinity to the occasion and, one would hope, with each other.<\/p><p>For those who wish to bring deeper unity to our island, the use of the term &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; should be ceased.  Therefore, appropriate amending legislation ought to be seriously considered as a part of a thorough consultation process.  Some might say this amounts only to playing with words or paying lip service but that is not the case.  Symbols and gestures matter and can bring people closer together, just as they can drive people apart.  The Queen's visit demonstrated the transformative power of gesture in the cause of reconciliation.  Human life does not stand still.  People either come together or they can be driven apart.  Our time in Europe is a time of coming together and resisting the forces that seek to break us up, of which there are many.  The peoples of Ireland have come so much closer since 1998 but nobody has the right to say this march to unity must stop at a certain point and that we have come so far together but may go no further.  The unity that lies ahead is not known and may not be the one expected.  Those who think unity will be a win for one side are false prophets and theirs is the way of division.  &quot;Ireland&quot; and not &quot;the Republic of Ireland&quot; is the way to unity.<\/p><p>It is easy to require others to give up symbols.  What we need are symbols that represent us all, are inclusive and that point to a future and not to the past.  &quot;Ireland&quot; is ancient, it is living and it is cultural.  &quot;The Republic of Ireland&quot; is political, non-inclusive and of the past.  We should never underestimate the power of symbol as a force to heal and reconcile.  Croke Park is both place and symbol.  It is a sacred place for some and a symbol of Irishness.  In 2007 the British anthem was played there as Irish rugby players from every corner of the island prepared to take on their English counterparts.  The tens of thousands of people present listened in spine-tingling, respectful silence.  That was a moment of catharsis, a moment when Ireland was changed forever and a new and confident dawn broke out.  It was a moment of inclusion and respect taking place on hallowed turf, brought together by the sporting prowess of young men from every part of the island of Ireland.  These young men, lest we forget, represented Ireland and not the Republic of Ireland.<\/p><p>At an appropriate time, when a once-in-a-generation Border poll is conducted the challenge is to win the hearts and minds of the majority of the people.  This will involve demonstrating a generosity of substance from the get-go and an empathy for the opposing communities' concerns.  In the interim and as a stepping-stone to unity, there is room to consider innovative legislation because this shows intent at the beginning of the way one wants to proceed.  This motion is innovative and part of a bigger picture that shows intent and inclusivity.  I commend and support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#BBB00400","speaker":"1667"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Before I call on Senator Sherlock, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and his guests to the Gallery.

We in the Labour Party very much support it.<\/p> <p>As has been said a number of times, we have all seen the massive surge on the island of Ireland for Irish passports over the last 18 months in particular and the frustrations that were associated with all that.  It is also important to acknowledge that we saw a significant response from Government on the resourcing of the passport service.  On the waiting times, I have detected a reduction in those frustrations out there.  I am also conscious the concept of a physical passport office is something fewer and fewer people are having to engage with any more.  That is because of the excellent online ordering service and the post office service that is available.  Due to those, many of us never have to darken the door of the Passport Office.  However, to rely on that as an argument to dismiss the need for an office in Belfast would be a mistake and in some ways misses the point.  It misses the point on both a political level and a practical one.  It is political because people in the North have an entitlement to identify as Irish citizens and therefore an entitlement to an Irish passport.  That right is unique outside this jurisdiction and happens nowhere else in the world.  We must treat that right to citizenship with the dignity and respect it deserves.  On a practical level, few of us need to engage with the physical passport service any more but when we need it, by God do people need it, especially when they need the urgent appointment service.  I have dealt with people, especially in Donegal, over the last number of months who end up having to travel the long distance to Dublin when it would be two hours to Belfast.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Marie Sherlock:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->For people in the North, and in the north west, there is a real and practical importance to having a passport service in the North.  It is also important to pay tribute to the three Passport Office locations we have in the South.  While it can often seem like there is a two or three-day delay in the online urgent appointments service, or certainly this was the case up to the middle of the summer anyway regarding any of the cases I was dealing with, my advice to people was always to get into the car and turn up at the nearest office at 9 a.m.  People were then seen that day.<\/p><p>If people are living many hours' drive from an office, however, will they take the risk of turning up, not knowing if they are going to be seen that day, unless they are given direct advice to do so?  In fairness, and this was not stated publicly, people who turned up at the offices were being seen within a few hours of arriving.  Therefore, there is a real and practical importance associated with having a physical office in a location to provide passport services in an area across the north west and the North where well over 1 million Irish citizens live.  I commend this motion.  It is important politically and practically that we see progress on this issue.  It is also important to acknowledge that there has been cross-party support for this development for some time, so we do need to see some progress now being made by the Government in this regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#BBB00600","speaker":"1683","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":200,"content":"<p>It was most definitely the summer of the passports.  All of us had nail-biting moments and long telephone waits.  I thank the brilliant Passport Office staff who went out of their way to help people as much as they possibly could.  An incredible 1 million passports will be issued this year.  This, in itself, is good news and something to be welcomed.  We must also thank the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the response to address the volume of applications.  They moved mountains to bring in the resources needed, including the doubling of the number of staff since June 2021.<\/p> <p>If I can be excused a pun, I know that the direction of travel is that we are moving towards an online application process for passports.  In the North, some 87% of passports issued have originated from the passports online service.  I still feel this is an important motion, however, and I support it.  I also supported the motion tabled by Senator Wilson, and I think the wording is the same, before the summer recess.  The problems I referred to concerning the volume of applications have been addressed.  Some 84% of online renewal applications from adults have been issued in three working days or less.  Since March, the turnaround time for first-time online applications has decreased by 50%, and now stands at 20 days.  Therefore, the problems have been addressed.  <\/p> <p>At the same time, however, this is a practical issue for people.  If people run into problems in this process, then they need to be able to access a physical office for late and urgent appointments.  Even though these types of situations account for only 1% of passport applications, those 1% of people require their passports, for holidays or emergency situations, for example, and they really need these appointments.  I have been on the phone enough times in recent months to know plenty of people in the North would have benefited from such appointments to try to sort out their passports before they went on their holidays.  This then is a practical issue, but it is also one of principle.  Based on this aspect, I also support the motion and having a branch of the Passport Office in Belfast.  Equally, though, I would also like to see an office in the north west to provide services to the people of Tyrone, Derry and Fermanagh, as well as Donegal, Sligo and Mayo.  It is extremely important that we have a geographical spread of these offices so people can have access in emergency situations.<\/p> <p>To focus on some other aspects and difficulties in this regard, people applying for Irish passports in the North who went to try to get help from those MPs and the MLAs familiar to them found that even though those elected representatives could witness passport applications, they could not action them.  Those of us in this House have access to the helpline, but our elected colleagues in the North do not, and this is an issue which affects them doing their job.  It would help if there was a specific email address or phone number for politicians in the North.  People trying to submit these passport applications are sometimes in crisis situations and they wish to be able to reach out to the public representatives they are familiar with and that they know will go the extra mile for them.  I was delighted to be able to help my family and friends in Tyrone in recent months in this regard.<\/p> <p>Turning to Passport Express, people are familiar with this process.  When they go to the post office, they like to be able to check that they have everything needed for an application.  That human touch is important.  I am aware that we are encouraging people to migrate to online services, but, again, from a practical perspective, there are always going to be people who want to have the security, as they see it, of a paper application.  The post offices in the North do run out of application forms.  This is happening even in areas where it might not be expected to occur.<\/p> <p>Therefore, I strongly support this motion.  I would love to see a geographical spread of Passport Office locations across the north west, the North, Dublin and Cork.  We must be building a shared island.  This is what we believe in.  We must also be supporting and helping people to get practical access to a service that really matters to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#CCC00200","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":201,"content":"<p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling this motion.  I support it and its aims.  We have had several debates on passport issues in the last year.  The concerns and negativity evident in the first two debates are not as apparent today because things have improved in this regard.  This is not to say there have not been difficulties this year, but there has been a sea change in delivery and turnaround times in recent months.  This must be acknowledged.  Equally, however, it is a very stressful ordeal and we could all give testimony concerning some of the cases people have experienced, including people having to go to the Passport Office for emergency appointments, if they can get them.  Other people have missed flights or have had to change flights.  Many applicants were not sure what to do, including whether to cancel a paper application and to try the online process.  People have endured all sorts of difficulties in recent months due to the unprecedented demand for passport services.  Therefore, anything that makes this process easier and simpler is to be welcomed.<\/p> <p>While we are obviously moving towards the provision of more services online, even the online process can be difficult for certain people.  This includes the elderly and people who are not tech savvy.  Having one-on-one assistance in person, even to take the required photograph and to ensure it is valid and uploaded, can be done more easily and conveniently in a situation where it is possible to meet people from the Passport Office, upload the documentation and get the passport a few days later.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Having facilities like this in Northern Ireland will be of significant assistance to our citizens there who wish to avail of an Irish passport.  Approximately 11,000 passport applications are received from Northern Ireland per month, so assistance in that regard would be welcome.<\/p><p>I cannot advocate for there being a passport office in every county, but there are gaps.  We have offices in Dublin and Cork, so the north and west would be well served by having a passport office in the North and an additional one in the west, be it in Galway, Mayo or wherever.  That would be useful.  It would not have to be of such a scale and size as the Dublin Passport Office.  It just has to be somewhere that is secure and where people can meet staff and do the uploading.<\/p><p>We should be moving away from paper applications.  If ready assistance is provided in more locations, paper applications can eventually be done away with.  They have created problems in terms of being able to expedite them, for example, in emergencies, and they can be left for weeks before they are even looked at.  They created problems over the past year when the passport service was under pressure.<\/p><p>Opening other offices makes sense in terms of serving our citizens and trying to make life easier for them, be they in the North or elsewhere.  That should be promoted and accepted by the Government.  There are always issues to consider in respect of security, printing presses and so on.  I understand Cork does not have a printer.  Regardless of whether it should, this is about processing applications, having contact with people, uploading data and pictures, getting those sent off and having passports printed in Dublin and sent down from there.  There would not be an issue in that regard.<\/p><p>I agree with Senator Currie on public representatives in the Assembly and MPs having quicker access for dealing with passport queries that come across their desks.  This matter was mentioned previously when the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was before us.<\/p><p>I acknowledge the improvements that have been made since the start of the year.  There are still some issues.  A colleague has been dealing with two EU citizens who are married, have children and are living in this country.  A number of their children have passports but they have run into major difficulties trying to get a passport for their third or fourth child despite the fact they are resident, working and contributing here.  They are from EU member states.  There seem to be some issues with understanding what is required.  They have been asked to provide their residency permits even though they are citizens of the EU and are entitled to be here.  This has created difficulties and getting the passport has taken an inordinate amount of time.  They feel aggrieved over this because they are here legitimately and are working and contributing.  They are entitled to the service the same as anyone else.<\/p><p>While I acknowledge there have been improvements, we can go further and there are more improvements we can consider making.  I welcome and support the motion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#CCC00300","speaker":"1665","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis na Comhalta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir sa Seanad.

I am glad many Irish people got the opportunity to go abroad this year.  The majority were able to get their passports and do so.  That is a sign of a country that, despite our challenges, is doing well and where many people - we want there to be more - are able to avail of holidays abroad.  Of course, passports in other cases were needed for purposes other than holidays, but the majority were for holidays.<\/p> <p>Now that the dust has settled on the summer, I do not wish only to address the motion before us but to update the House on the significant improvements that have been made by the passport service this year.  I thank the staff in the Passport Office for the more positive position we are in now.  Senators will have seen in their constituency offices a significant drop in inquiries about passports from constituents and so on.  Senators will be pleased to hear that the service in the Passport Office has returned to pre-Covid levels.  I wish to make a few key points.  The passport service has issued more than 940,000 passports this year.  This is more passports than were issued in total in 2019, which was previously busiest year.  This year, we will issue more than 1 million passports.  We can be proud of this significant milestone.  Of the 1 million, 10% or more will issue to Northern Ireland.  There may be up to 130,000 successful applications for passports from Northern Ireland, although this year's figures are not finalised.<\/p> <p>Turnaround times for online applications are now in line with normal pre-Covid processing times.  Some 99% of all online applications are processed within the standard turnaround times and 84% of adult online renewal applications are being processed in three working days or less.  This means that, if someone is renewing a passport, he or she can apply on a Monday and will more than likely have that passport in his or her hand by Wednesday or Thursday.  This summer, a constituent called me on a Sunday night.  He was travelling on Wednesday but his passport was out of date.  I said we would try to help but that the best thing he could do would be to apply online there and then.  He had the passport on the Tuesday.  That is testament to our system.  Almost half of child online renewal passports are issued in three working days or less.<\/p> <p>Some comparisons have been made with Britain, although I am not sure they are entirely accurate.  In Britain, it currently takes ten weeks to get a UK passport.  In the USA, it takes seven to ten weeks.  The Irish passport service is doing considerably better than that.  For the majority of people, it has been doing considerably better than that all throughout this year.  That almost half of child online renewal passports are issued within three working days is an incredible turnaround.<\/p> <p>I understand the reasoning behind the motion, but the public is ahead of us.  Almost everyone is applying online and, for those who are not, the unified message from the Seanad should be that they should apply online.  There is no one on this island who needs to apply by paper.  We should tell people not to go to the post office to post an application and instead to apply online.  I am sure Deputies and Senators will be more than happy to assist constituents, as we have done, to fill out the form online, given that applicants will get their passports more quickly that way.<\/p> <p>There are some issues with first-time passports, which were taking longer to issue.  They will always take longer because of the security checks that need to take place.  Even then, first-time applications that were taking 40 working days in March are now taking 20 working days or less.  If someone's passport is out of date for more than five years, the application becomes a first-time application again.  The reason for this is simple.  The Department, due to data protection regulations and its own procedures, does not hold for more than 15 years the information that someone provides.  As such, it no longer has the information to do a standard renewal and must go through the process all over again.  We have seen some cases where people were not expecting delays but whose applications necessarily took longer because of data protection issues arising from their passports being out of date for more than five years.  We need to warn people about this so that they are aware of it.<\/p> <p>All calls to the customer service hub are being answered within five minutes - this is good and I thank the staff - and 95% of web chat inquiries are being answered consistently by the service.  Currently, the Passport Office does not accept urgent appointments just to deal with queries.  All queries have to go through the customer service hub, be they via phone calls or online.  All that is done in person in the office is accepting urgent applications for passports.  Citizens who want to inquire about the status of their applications or who have questions while they are putting their applications together can access the information they need through the hub.  We have put in place a number of staffing measures to ensure this excellent level of customer service continues in the long term, particularly coming up to next summer.  We had a peak at this time last year coming up to October when people were taking a chance.  For them, it was their first break in a number of years.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Thomas Byrne:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I do not see any sign of that at the moment but again if people have not checked their passports and they are going away at Hallowe'en, they should do so now.  This is an unprecedented investment by the Government in this citizens' central service.  That is for citizens of the entire island and all around the world.  We have had 11 competitions for staff and doubled the number of staff since June of last year.  We have provided new office space at the Balbriggan campus which can now accommodate over 500 staff who deal with the day-to-day processing of applications.  Balbriggan is a huge operation and a massive economic boon to the area and to my own Meath East constituency.  <\/p><p>When considering the decision as to whether to open offices, the Department has to look at a range of things.  What efficiencies could be gained?  Do we improve the overall level of service?  Does it complement the digital first approach that promotes the use of Passport Online?  Above everything else, everybody should apply online.  Finally, are the substantial costs involved outweighed by the potential benefits?  At the moment we have the Passport Office in Mount Street, the place in Balbriggan and an office in Cork city.  London was mentioned as well.  London does not really print, I think.  It takes a long time to turn around a passport.  The offices in Mount Street and Cork have public counters.  They offer urgent appointment services for those who wish to renew their passport within one or four days in Dublin or within four days in Cork.  If Senators listened to what I said earlier, 84% of online adult renewals and 50% of child online renewals are taking three working days or less, meaning that for most people the Passport Online service is faster than going to the office in Dublin or Cork in person.  These are really important messages to get across to the public.  Our teams are doing fantastic work.<\/p><p>Recent figures show that just 28% of the urgent appointments at the moment are looked for.  Of the available appointments, just over a quarter are being filled at the moment.  That was different during the summer, we all know it was difficult to get an appointment.  It has changed dramatically.  About 1% of all passports arise from people going to the office in Dublin or Cork.  If there are 11,000 a month from the North of Ireland, out of that we can still say it is about 1%, so about 110 people from the North of Ireland are coming to the office in Dublin, probably, on a monthly basis at the moment.  Those are the figures we have.  We want to reduce that even more.  There is no question about it.  I think the constituent I advised would have gone and looked for an emergency appointment only I said he should chance the online application and I thought he would be okay.  We can never give guarantees, of course.  I suspect that even some of those in Northern Ireland who come down would probably have got it more quickly online.  Can I also say, for anybody who is dealing with a death abroad or anything like that, the Department pulls out all the stops.  The staff really do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#DDD00200","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":205,"content":"<p>They do.

We reckon that Passport Online is available to all Irish citizens on this island and 97% of Irish citizens around the world.  There are some countries where people cannot apply online.  Passport Online has been extremely successful.  Some 90% of applicants use it.  This has reduced massively the number of people who visit the post office or passport offices to apply in person.  The public is doing this and we want more and more of them to apply online as well.  That message is getting out there.  It takes six minutes on a smartphone to apply for a passport.  The online application process is much faster than going through the post.  Online is the quickest, cheapest and most convenient way for everyone to apply for their passport, North and South.  There is no difference whatsoever.  Some Senators mentioned the post office.  I would urge all Senators who have mentioned the post office to go back to their constituents and tell them to apply online.  Wherever they are on this island, it is going to take a lot less time.<\/p> <p>The passport service is now pursuing a digital first strategy, as all the airlines have done.  As we come into our busy season early next year we will be promoting Passport Online in media outlets across the island.  That very much satisfies the citizenship side of Article 2 of the Constitution, which was referenced correctly by the Senator.  As well as providing a more user-friendly and efficient service for the citizen, Passport Online allows for the centralisation of processing which results in greater efficiencies.  I accept what Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said about the human touch and person-to-person contact being very important.  However, if we increased that significantly over what it is at the moment we would slow down the whole service.  By encouraging people to do it online, we have now significantly quicker processes than Britain or America.  There is absolutely no question about that.  We have put everyone else in the shade in terms of how quickly our passports go through at the moment.  A lot of the travel industry, and I am including this in the travel industry as well being a matter of citizenship, experienced challenges after Covid.  Despite unquestionable problems this year, and we all had them, our Department of Foreign Affairs really has risen to the challenge. <\/p> <p>The Senator is right that the number of Irish passport-holders resident in Northern Ireland has risen in recent years.  We get 11,000 applications a month from the North of Ireland.  This is about 10% of all applications.  I acknowledge the Senator's petition.  However, since the end of June more people have got a passport online from Northern Ireland than have signed the petition.  That is not to denigrate the petition or anything but just to show the Senator that tens of thousands of people in Northern Ireland are successfully applying for passports online.  A small number of people do need to go to the Passport Office but we think that could be even smaller.  Some 60% of renewals, the vast majority, are in three working days or less, even to the North of Ireland.  Some 40% of applications from the North are first-time applications.  They take longer, that is just the way it is and I think everybody will agree with that.  A passport is an important document and we do not hand them out willy-nilly.  That would be a breach of any concept of citizenship because it is such a valuable thing.  The figure from Northern Ireland applying online is 87%, slightly below what we do in the South but basically the same.  That will continue to grow if we all collectively get the message out.<\/p> <p>I ask Senators to support us in promoting Passport Online for all applicants through all of their networks in Northern Ireland which Senators have already mentioned.  The passport service is continually considering ways to improve its service.  We will look at the issue of MLAs and MPs in the North of Ireland, I have no difficulty with that.  We will just have to look at how it could be done and that will be a decision for the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  He apologies for not being here.  We regularly review the services that we offer.  The view of the Department, when we look at these facts and figures and consider the number of people who would potentially use that office, and look at the massive majority of people from the North of Ireland who apply online, is that we do not see the business case.  People have explicitly mentioned that there is another case, not just a business case and I accept Senators' point of view on that.  There are no obstacles to applying for a passport from the North of Ireland that do not also apply here.  It is basically the same, one or the other.  The distances from Castlebar, where Senator Chambers is from, or from other parts of the country are similar.  They make good arguments as well for having offices there but the truth is that all of this applies to them as well.<\/p> <p>Our current turnaround times for the Passport Online system are among the best in the world.  We never would have thought that could be the case.  We kind of knew because we knew what was happening but it did not feel like it last May or June.  The way to do that is to promote this digital first policy for all applicants regardless of their address, as it does deliver an exceptional service to citizens no matter where they live or where they are.  I thank the Seanad and the Chair for the opportunity to address Senators on this matter.  I urge them to use Passport Online and to tell their constituents about it.  Whether it is a first-time application or a renewal for an adult or a child, the fastest way is online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#EEE00300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":207,"content":"<p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I got my first passport in 1988. I did not get it in Ireland but in London.  I had been forced to emigrate like so many more people at that time.  It meant an awful lot to me that I could access an Irish passport as a London-Irish citizen by going to my embassy.  It was so long ago I was travelling through a country that no longer exists, Yugoslavia.  I find it really strange that we are here 35 years later and people in the Six Counties still have to come down and negotiate Dublin if there is a problem with their passport.

I support Senator Chambers call for a passport office in the west for the very same reasons.  Of course, it would be deeply symbolic and significant for citizens in the North to see an Irish passport office that they can access.  That would have a deep symbolism.  That is important and I make no apologies for saying that.  To regard this debate as an exercise in accounting is genuinely missing the point.  We are talking here about one of the most important things that one does as a citizen, which is to access a passport for travel.  I agree with every point the Minister of State has made on how good the service is and the Passport Office staff were heroes during an incredibly difficult time over the past couple of years.<\/p><p>Here is the point, however.  I spoke to a lady in the North only a couple of months back who had a problem with her application, she could not get through to the office and drove down to Dublin, which was no small task in itself, only to be told that she had to post the documents.  The point here is that when one has a problem, that is when one really needs to be able to access someone, that is, a person, to provide help at short notice.  Why should a person have to travel to Dublin to do that?  The fact that the service has an office in Cork is an acknowledgement in itself that not everything has to revolve through Dublin and be negotiated through the horrendous traffic to get to Dublin city centre.  It is not just as justifiable to access an office in the North and, indeed, an office in the west?  It makes perfect sense to do just that.<\/p><p>What is particularly significant about this motion, and I see my colleague, Senator Wilson, opposite and I want to give him full credit for this, is that this an issue and an initiative which he began and it commanded cross-party support.  Unless I am mistaken, every speaker here this evening has supported the idea of a passport office in the North.  The only person who has the demurred from that is the Minister of State.  <\/p><p>This Seanad works best when we work on a cross-party basis, when we put together what we share in common and we have done that here on a number of occasions.  What is clear here is that on a cross-party basis we support the idea of a passport office in the Six Counties, in the North.  Senator Joe O'Reilly put it best of all.

As I was saying, Senator Joe O'Reilly made the most powerful point of the evening so far when he asked what the Minister of State will do about this.

I apologise for the interruption earlier.  I know it was out of his control as there was a vote in the Lower House.  I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said in his opening remarks, since last June there has been an all-party motion on the Order Party on this important issue.  The fact it has been signed by representatives of all of the parties and Independents shows the significance of this important issue.  It is important to point out that the reason the motion was put on the Order Paper, and I initiated it along with Senators Currie and &Oacute; Donnghaile, was to avoid political parochialism.  The motion specifically mentions Belfast as the location for an office given the situation we have been in since Brexit and with a population of 1.9 million, and growing, in the Six Counties.  The number of applications being sent from the Six Counties to the Passport Office in Dublin for processing increased dramatically over the past two years.  More than 72,000 applications were received from the North this year alone.<\/p> <p>I appreciate that the vast majority of the applications were made online.  The Minister of State agreed in his contribution that first-time applications take a long time to process.  This is quite understandable.  I understand the majority of the applications from the North were first-time applications.  In my opinion, this number will only grow over the years to come.  As we are all aware, the 1.9 million citizens in the Six Counties are entitled to apply for an Irish passport, as well as a UK passport if they wish.  I respectfully suggest the number of people applying for an Irish passport will increase dramatically in the years ahead.  The population of the city of Belfast is almost 640,000 according to the recent census.  It would be a sensible idea to open an office in Belfast to facilitate our citizens in making an application.  It should be accessible to them in the Six Counties.<\/p> <p>I would love a passport office in County Cavan or County Monaghan, preferably in Cavan because it is the capital of south Ulster, but I am willing to concede this to the second city on our island, Belfast.  It would be an important thing to do.  It does not have to be a huge office.  A small office initially would suffice.  It is the opinion of the House that this should be considered very seriously by the Government.  Of course Galway and other parts of the country are entitled to make their case.  As an initial step, the people living in the Six Counties of our island should be facilitated as there will be a huge number of applications from there in the coming years.  This is my firm belief and the belief of the majority of people on both sides of the House.<\/p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  I hope I do not get him into trouble by thanking him personally for the assistance he has given me when helping people who got themselves into difficulties booking tickets and then finding out their passports were out of date.  I suggest that at this time of the year, when it is not as busy, the Passport Office should proactively seek applications for passports.  We will be back in the same situation next year.

Other speakers have said just how much work has been done.  The Minister of State outlined some of the statistics for the enormous turnaround we have seen on even months ago, or certainly last year, and the number of passports being produced.  It is an enormous recognition of the service delivered by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Notwithstanding the increase in the number of staff, I know that the individual staff in the Passport Office have put enormous effort into delivering passports.  I think the Minister of State said we are reaching 6,000 passports produced a day, or some figure akin to that, which is an astonishing number and contrasts very sharply with the figures for recent years, the highest number so far being in 2019.  I give credit to the Minister of State and the Department for doing that.  It is also a recognition of the value of the Irish passport, which has been referred to as well, and how desirable it is to people not just on this island but throughout the world to be a part of the global Irish community and to be citizens of Ireland.

I am delighted to hear it.  I recognise, however, that there is a practicality deficit in making that request.  I recognise wholeheartedly that the impetus behind this motion is so much about symbolism.  I also recognise the statement we would be making in opening a passport office in Belfast and I absolutely support the symbolism and the impetus behind that.  I also recognise, however, what the Minister of State has said about the practicality of it.  I do not know which overtakes the other or which is more important and I do not know that I can make that value judgment now, but I recognise what the Minister of State has said about the practicality of this.  I would be so proud if somebody living in Andersonstown could walk down the street to collect his or her Irish passport.  That, I think, would give us all great pride.  I reiterate, however, what the Minister of State said about how we have advanced in respect of the delivery of passports through an online system rather than an in-person system.  I share the stories others have told about people who have applied online and got their passports.  I think I renewed my passport two years ago.  I got it within two days of the application being made online, so it is an extraordinary service, and in that context there is a practicality consideration.<\/p> <p>Nonetheless I welcome the motion.

Queries about passports are among the queries we get that are actually solvable for people.<\/p> <p>On a serious note, however, I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.  Senator Gavan said everyone agrees with the motion.  It is not that I agree or disagree with it, and I do not want to be on the side of disagreeing with it.  I do not disagree with it because the symbolic nature of it is what is important rather than whether it is necessarily more important to have an office in Belfast than in Mayo or Tipperary or even D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is that symbolic nature of this, which is clearly important.  Due to the increase in the uptake of passports in Northern Ireland since Brexit, that is quite clear.<\/p> <p>From a practical point of view, if we had a passport office in Belfast - let us say for argument's sake that it would be quite similar to the one in Cork - one would not be able to get one's passport on the day of application.  It comes four days later.  Therefore, if there were two people in Belfast today, if there were a passport office in Belfast and if one person decided to get an emergency appointment, that person would receive his or her passport four days later.  However, if the other person just booked online, he or she would receive a passport within three days.  Therefore, in respect of the speed of the Passport Office, because it is so successful at the moment, because there are 570 people, I think, working in the Passport Office, it has one of the fastest turnaround times for passports in the world.  The quickest way for anyone to get a passport is just to apply online.  We say that to people all the time, and there is still a very small percentage who apply through paper, which is problematic.  It would be quicker just to apply online, even if there were a passport office in Belfast.  If one lives in Cork, one is much quicker just applying online rather than going in for an emergency appointment in Cork.  Therefore, while I accept the symbolic nature of the motion, the practicality is that the quickest possible way to get a passport is just to apply online.<\/p> <p>A number of months ago we had a Private Members' motion tabled here by the Fine Gael Party on passports, and representatives of the Passport Office came in along with the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  I think they thought they were coming in for a grilling for two hours on the Passport Office and how many people were looking for passports at the time.  However, it was a very constructive engagement across all parts of this Chamber.  It is important to acknowledge that from that two-hour debate we had in this House, the turnaround in passports has been incredible and the number of passports that have been delivered is incredible.  I think it is something like 720,000 this year already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#JJJ00800","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":224,"content":"<p>It is more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#JJJ00900","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":225,"content":"<p>It was only 600,000-odd last year, so the turnaround has been incredible.  The number of passports that have been delivered this year has been incredible.  Senator Wilson said we need to get the awareness out that people should renew their passports at off-peak times, and I agree with him.  He mentioned we will be in the same predicament next summer.  We will not really because last summer was unique.  There were almost three years backlog of people looking for passports last summer, and that will not be the case next summer.  It will be just a normal summer such as we had in 2018 or 2019.<\/p> <p>The other reason it will be different is that we now have almost double the number of staff working in the Passport Office.  Therefore, because of the work the Passport Office has done, I think we will be in a much stronger position next summer than we have ever been before.  It is important to recognise, however, that the Passport Office was under immense pressure in the past year or so.  There was a point when I was dealing with more than 100 people looking for passports all at the same time.  Luckily, we got almost all of them sorted in time, which is an immense credit to the Department, to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the Minister of State and to everyone who works in the Passport Office for the work that has been done over recent months.  I have dealt with so many people who thought they would not get their passports in time but who got them about 24 hours before their flights went out, and they are so grateful that that was done.<\/p> <p>One thing I will say about paper applications, and I wonder if the Minister of State could look at this-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#JJJ01200","speaker":"1629"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":226,"content":"<p>Do not send them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#JJJ01300","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":227,"content":"<p>\"Do not send them\" is definitely the advice to give.  However, on first-time applications there is an estimated date, and people come to us worried about whether they will get the passport in time.  There could be an estimated date, say, in the middle of October or the middle of November, and someone could be applying a week after the estimated date.  We politicians cannot do anything about it until the estimated date has passed.  Is there some leeway - well, not leeway, because I understand that there are technicalities to first-time passports, which is really important, and they are some of the safest passports in the world and are recognised as such.  However, we cannot make any representations to the Passport Office until that estimated date passes.  Sometimes that leaves a gap of only a day or two to try to get a passport done on time.  If there were any sort of leeway that could be given on that in the future, that would be helpful.

First, we have learned under freedom of information requests that for the first time more people from the North have applied for an Irish rather than a British passport.  That is extraordinary.  The passport of choice for the majority of those in the North is, naturally, not as accessible as the next sought-after alternative, namely, British passports.  Second is the new in-person appointment service in the Irish Passport Office on Cromwell Road in London.  There is precedence for such an office in the North.  It would give expression to the statement from the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in May this year regarding the possibility of opening additional passport offices outside of Dublin.<\/p><p>I support the motion and commend Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile on prioritising it.

I commend Sinn F&eacute;in on putting forward the motion on passport services on the island.  It complements the Fianna F&aacute;il motion brought forward by Senators Wilson and McGreehan not long ago.  That is the approach taken by the House on this issue during this term.<\/p> <p>I could be petty and say we could do with a passport office in the north west where, in conjunction with Derry, up to half a million people live.  The reality is there is a larger city on the east coast, Belfast, which is the second largest city on the island.  It should get the recognition from the Government it deserves.  When we talk about sharing this island, I believe the Government needs to lead from the front.  If we really want to share this island, we have to show people in Northern Ireland that they are not being left on their own.  It is something on which the Government need to leads.<\/p> <p>I accept the figures the Minister of State has given, but this is about more than figures.  The Department of Foreign Affairs needs to lead and show an example.  It needs to show the people of Northern Ireland they are as welcome as any other in this State.  One could say the whole upper half of the island does not have a passport office.  I do not think that is good enough.  The upper half of the island has suffered over many years because of the Border.  We now need to show an example and move beyond that to show the region is now more accessible and given much greater consideration.  In that context, I do not believe the Minister of State or Minister need to look any further.  It is now time for action, and I join my colleagues in the House and calling for that action.  We would like to see a passport office in the upper half of the island.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#KKK00200","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>I again thank the Senators who have brought forward the motion.  I welcome the update from the Minister of State on the achievement with the Passport Office this year.  It has been a challenging time, something that is understood by everyone.  The Department of Foreign Affairs put measures in place.  As the Minister of State has noted, the demand for online passports is incredible.  I understand the online service will issue in excess of 1 million passports this year.  Our population is growing and is now more than 5.5 million.<\/p> <p>Regarding Northern Ireland, it is fantastic to see there have been 11,000 passport applications.  The Minister of State said the figures stay roughly the same from month to month.  Over 60% of applications are renewals.  It is great to see the development and supports that have been put in place.  I understand the need for more support, such as the additional office that was created and doubling of the work staff.  That was crucial and needed five or six months ago, and it was put in place.<\/p> <p>However, there have been challenging periods and we have all learned from that.  We have learned how to ensure people are applying online where possible.  We also need to acknowledge we have an older population.  People aged 65 years or older may not have access to online applications, may be challenged when it comes to applying online and may instead submit paper applications.  It is not something people want to hear when they want to get something quickly.<\/p> <p>Another challenge I came across with my constituents is first-time applications.  The process has been explained.  However, there are challenges around Garda stations that are only open for three or four hours a day rather than on a 24-hour basis.  There are challenges in rural areas in ensuring Garda stations can acknowledge queries from the Passport Office.  Something has to be done and I understand it is being addressed.<\/p> <p>I thank the Senators who brought forward the motion.  There are a number of points we can highlight.  I will, of course, fight for the west.  I would love to see a passport office there.  However, I want to double the workforce, put in place an additional office and ensure we maintain supports for people who do not have access to online services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#KKK00300","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>Strictly speaking, the Minister of State is not supposed to come back in but he can make a brief contribution.

Within the time available to me, I will not be able to recap everything that has been said.  I thank Members and the Minister of State for their contributions.  I also thank them for their support because this is an important issue.  I do not say this in a combative way, but in campaigning since 2016 for a passport office in the North, to my great regret in many ways I have become the passport office in the North.  I am acutely familiar with the problems.<\/p> <p>In his opening remarks, the Minister of State said the turnaround time for online applications are now in line with normal pre-Covid processing times.  Everything was not normal pre-Covid.  There were still issues, and that is why I have campaigned for this since 2016.  There are people who campaigned before then because there was a clear need and rationale for an office in the North.<\/p> <p>I wish to recap on a couple of points.  I again thank Senator Wilson for the initial drive on this motion.  It was remiss of me not to acknowledge the steps taken by the Government in terms of the context of Covid and the additional services and investment made.  I acknowledge and appreciate that, and I should have said that in my earlier contribution.  In response to Senator Chambers and others, I have no issue with an office going into the west.<\/p> <p>If my experience on this was based solely on my experience of an online renewal for my passport, I would think everything was fine.  I applied online and received my passport book within three days and card within five days.  However, that is not the experience for everyone.  While online is good and effective for a lot of people, we have not yet got to a place where it is available for all.  During Covid and following the lifting of restrictions and subsequently, my office was on the phone several times, including today.  There is not a day that I open my Facebook or Twitter without a series of messages about passport delays and issues.  It is still an issue, and that is the reality of the situation.  That is why I and the House have made the case on this.<\/p> <p>Senator Currie raised an important point, which I raised during a debate on a motion in September last year and subsequently in a Commencement matter debate.  MPs and MLAs from the North should have access to a dedicated helpline, hub or whatever it may be.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=05\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the day said that I was putting that to him while he was on his feet but that he would go away and look at it.  I would hope that it has been looked at and hopefully we can hear something back soon that there would be a service for elected representatives from the North to be able to engage with the Passport Office in a more speedy fashion.<\/p><p>Senator Martin raised a couple of issues around Article 4.  I will probably save my replying points in order to have a conversation with him over a cup of coffee because he raised some important issues and matters I might like to talk to him about.<\/p><p>For me, and that is why I made the point at the beginning of this contribution, I have been campaigning for this since 2016.  The Government has been aware of problems around delays and a backlog which has only been exacerbated post-Brexit, and further exacerbated in the context of the restrictions being lifted.  I do not oppose it and I have no issue with it, but a new office was opened in Balbriggan.  There was a case for a new office and that is where the Department put it, which was in Balbriggan.  That was a decision and it is fair enough but that office could have gone elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#KKK00900","speaker":"1688","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":242,"content":"<p>Well said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2022100500002#LLL00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speech","time":1664962200,"counter":243,"content":"<p>The other point is that the Minister of State referred to the business case for an office in the North not stacking up.  I do not hear very often Ministers coming in here and citing business cases when motions, Commencement matters or other requests are being made seeking particular investment.  I would be keen, therefore, to know if the business case has been carried out and, if it has, could we please be furnished with that business case?  I would very much like to see it given that it has been cited today.<\/p> <p>In that regard and specifically on the Belfast location, I made the point that I have no issue with where it goes in the North, whether it be Belfast, west of the Bann or wherever, because there is a logical and rational argument for that.  Belfast City Council has a vacant to vibrant capital grant scheme, where it is encouraging investment into vacant properties and there will be all sorts of support for the Department if it has any worries about the cost.  I believe it would be cost neutral, based on the parliamentary questions that party colleagues of mine have submitted.<\/p> <p>The Irish Government already has grade A office space in Belfast.  The Minister of State has already probably been in it in the course of his own work as I know that many of us have, and many people from all traditions and backgrounds go there for discussions, meetings and whatever it might be in that grade A office space.  There is nothing stopping the passport service and the Department from putting half a dozen desks in that space that would act as a passport service when people need to rush and to access people for help.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the existing infrastructure and see if we can exploit it. <\/p> <p>I thank Members for their support, I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and attention, and I hope that ultimately we can get this resolved and get the office, no matter where it might be in the Six Counties, open and delivering for the people who need it.
