The committee is aware of the many changes to our banking sector in recent years, driven by factors including advances in technology and changing consumer demand.  We have also seen the exit of two key banks from the sector in Ireland, which has had and will continue to have very wide-reaching consequences.  The changes under way in the banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the sector is facing across the world.  It is because of these national and global developments that my Department is undertaking a broad-ranging review of retail banking in our country to address how the sector can be best positioned to meet current and future needs.  I look forward to completing this work later in the year.<\/p> <p>  In the midst of this change, it is crucial that we recognise the interest of citizens and their priorities as we make policy.  With this in mind, the Government intends to further enhance the Central Bank's existing powers through provisions to be introduced in the Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022.  The centrepiece of this new legislation, in accordance with a commitment in the programme for Government, is the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, which seeks to improve the culture of the financial sector and restore public trust in it.  It is apparent that as the sector undergoes significant change, the credit union sector has the potential to play a more significant role in the provision of financial services to households and businesses.  That is why my Department has conducted a policy review of the credit union sector and is developing legislation to support credit unions further.<\/p> <p>  We are doing this in awareness of the significant change that is taking place in terms of digital technology and access to cash.  We have seen a shift in the way consumers and businesses are using banking services and making payments.  While Ireland has historically been a relatively cash-intensive economy, significant changes have occurred, with a rapid increase in the move towards more digital technologies and new ways of banking.  New players have entered the financial services sector and are offering new and innovative services to consumers.  The Covid-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for this move towards digital payments. <\/p> <p>  By the end of the year, the European Commission will have published legislation making instant payments mandatory for participants within the EU.  This means Irish consumers will soon be able to benefit from instant payments between individuals and companies.  Notwithstanding the significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish banking system.  Banks have a key role in the maintenance of the flow of cash through the economy and in ensuring appropriate access to retail banking services for all in society, including the vulnerable.  In this context, I note the significant public reaction to AIB's announcement in July regarding branch changes.  I welcomed the bank's decision at that time not to proceed with the proposed changes to customer services in certain branches.<\/p> <p>  In February 2021, NatWest began the process of winding down its Ulster Bank business in the Republic of Ireland.  Shortly after, on 16 April, KBC Bank announced its withdrawal from the Irish market.  All of this will be done in accordance with Irish legislation, including the Central Bank's codes of conduct.  The Central Bank has clear requirements that apply when firms cease operations or transfer operations to another entity.  Last week, it published an update showing an encouraging downward trend of accounts in the withdrawing banks.  The banking sector must continue to ensure adequate resources and training.  My officials and the Central Bank are engaging with all stakeholders to ensure they receive the best possible customer experience.  Customer protection is at the forefront of our engagement and consumers must be certain the entity they are banking with is trustworthy, efficient and accountable.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to the SEAR.  The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022 was published on 28 July this year and will progress in the coming months.  It will drive greater accountability in the financial sector and raise the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system.  I believe it will drive positive change in the culture of the financial services industry, including enhanced accountability, and provide for clearer sanctions against individuals who fail in their role.<\/p><p>The Central Bank will hold public consultations on the implementation of the Bill.<\/p><p> As I mentioned at the start, last November my Department began a review of the retail banking sector.  Stakeholders were invited to make submissions and we launched a public consultation on 16 May at the retail banking review dialogue.  We have now received 90 submissions and I expect to receive the report of the retail banking review in November.  Part of our consideration refers to the credit union movement.  It is a cornerstone of community banking and provides a wide range of services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and my Department have carried out extensive stakeholder engagement and we have received input from a wide range of stakeholders to develop a comprehensive set of policy proposals.  The Government announced and approved these proposals in July and drafting of the Bill is under way.  Department officials are engaging with the sector through the quarterly stakeholder round table and with the Credit Union Advisory Committee.<\/p><p> I turn to the State&rsquo;s role in the Irish banking sector.  It is important to remember that the aim is to strike a balance between intervention and allowing the sector to operate with commercial independence, such that competition and innovation are not stunted.  The Bank of Ireland share trading plan has continued in recent months and I expect to be able to announce shortly that the State&rsquo;s directed shareholding has reduced to zero.  This will be an important milestone in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s policy of returning the banks to private ownership.  Proceeds generated from the share trading plan since its launch will be well over &euro;800 million.  In June of this year the State sold a 5% stake in AIB, which reduced our shareholding to 63.5% while generating &euro;305 million for the Exchequer.  Prior to this transaction, a share trading plan was in operation which provided for a low-key and low-cost resumption of share sales after a gap of more than four years.  It will resume operating at the end of this month and the Department of Finance will continue to monitor markets for future opportunities to sell down more of our shareholding through larger transactions.  In the past year we have made great progress in strengthening the position of Permanent TSB in the market and in protecting citizens&rsquo; investment in the bank.  Permanent TSB now has greater scale and has a more important role than ever in providing meaningful competition in Ireland.  Although Permanent TSB will primarily fund the transaction from internal resources, the bank is expected to issue shares to NatWest also.  As a result, NatWest will hold 16.66% of the issued share capital of Permanent TSB while the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Permanent TSB will reduce from 74.9% to 62.4%.  However, we will then have a smaller stake in a much larger and more attractive bank in the years ahead.  I look forward to seeing Permanent TSB playing its role as a supporter of growth and jobs in Ireland.<\/p><p> The banking sector in Ireland is going through considerable change.  My officials and I are working to ensure that amid this change consumers are fully protected and the banking sector, which is integral to the economy and to society, is strengthened for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his lengthy introduction.  I appreciate that this is a particularly busy week for him and it is always appreciated when he has the opportunity to engage with the committee.  There is one area of the banking sector I would like to pick up on that the Minister did not quite go into in his remarks.  It came up in quite a bit of detail last week during our engagements with the three banks when Deputy Barry asked a number of questions on mortgages and interest rates.  We all know that compared with its EU counterparts, Ireland has traditionally had much higher interest rates on mortgages in recent years.  While it is welcome that these rates have come down in recent years, I was wondering if the Minister could elaborate, either in his position as Minister for Finance or as president of the Eurogroup, on what impact he would expect the recent rise and surge in inflation, particularly at a European level, to have on this.  Are we looking at a convergence between Irish and EU rates in the near future?  What other actions might need to be taken in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As he has acknowledged, a significant degree of change is under way with regard to interest rate policy in the future.  The European Central Bank, ECB, through its president and the chief economist, has indicated the kind of action it will consider in the future.  If inflation in Ireland becomes a core part of our economy for years to come, it will make us even poorer for longer.  I accept that a change in interest rates can bring difficulty for those who are borrowing and who want to borrow in the future, but any changes that are made are made with the aim of avoiding inflation and ensuring we are not poorer for longer.<\/p> <p>  On where we stand in Ireland, we have seen considerable change in interest rates over many years.  In 2014 we started off with an average level of fixed interest rates for new lending of 4.1% and in July of this year it moved to 2.5%.  A key feature that has developed alongside this is that over 80% - in July the figure reached 88% - of new mortgages being issued are fixed-rate mortgages.  That is one of the reasons we have seen a decline in the interest rate in new mortgages, which has moved from 4% in 2014 to 2.6% in July of this year.  We are now at a point where the gap between the Irish rate for new borrowing and the average of the eurozone is 0.5%, which is a significant decrease on where we have been for so long.  I would expect to see change in the years to come.  The Deputy knows what the powers of the Central Bank are when it comes to variable-rate mortgage holders as changes are made to their rates of interest.  We have also strengthened consumer protection for those consumers who require certain issues to be considered.  We are seeing a narrowing between ourselves and the rest of the eurozone, but we are at a moment of change in these things and the public indications are that just as inflation is staying higher for longer, banks will take that into account in the interest rate decisions they make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>When the Minister says \"we are at a moment of change\", that leads into my next question and they are all related.  No different from any of us as Deputies with constituencies, people continuously contacted my office throughout the summer because they are worried about the pricing on their borrowings - a mortgage, a car loan or anything else - especially in the context of wider concerns about rising energy costs and the entire cost-of-living area.  When we engage with the banks and when individuals have engaged with banks, one issue that has come up is the high rate of capital levels that Irish banks have been required to maintain in recent years, compared with European counterparts.  Is that an area where we might also be at a point of change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00400","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":11,"content":"<p>This is a decision that is made by central banks and regulators.  The Central Bank of Ireland decides how much capital our banks hold and I will not give an indication on how an independent regulatory decision could be made.  I know Deputy Richmond will understand why that is the case and why I have to take that course of comment.  I am aware of all the commentary that has taken place on the difference between capital levels for Irish banks, the amount and kind of capital they are required to hold and how that stacks up versus other countries.  That then has an impact on the interest rates that are made available to new borrowers.  I am aware of all of that but I would make two points alongside it.  First, if we ever needed a reminder of the importance of banks being well capitalised and being resilient, it was when we got hit by a pandemic in Ireland.<\/p><p>Our financial sector here did not become an amplifier of the economic shock that was the closure of our economy for prolonged periods.  That demonstrated the value of our banking sector having a high degree of capital because that was one of the reasons, alongside the economic support the Government made available, that the financial sector avoided becoming part of the problem.<\/p><p> The second reason is that the high level of capital our banks have is directly driven by the scale of the banking crisis we endured in Ireland for a number of years.  That period is part of the overall period which the regulators use to calculate the level of capital banks should hold now.  This is an illustration of the many costs and consequences of our banking system running into such extraordinary difficulty and the costs that were borne from that.  It reminds me of the need never to get to that point again.  Of course, as that crisis recedes into the rearview mirror, its role in influencing the level of capital that our banks must hold will also recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The Minister alluded to the area of bank departures, particularly when it comes to both Ulster Bank and KBC Bank Ireland.  Something that remains of concern, about which a number of people have contacted me, is with regard to switching.  I am not talking about the switching of accounts, which the Minister mentioned, but everything that goes with it in terms of standing orders and perhaps direct debits to cover utility bills.  Is the Minister satisfied that the banks and also the utility companies are doing enough to encourage and facilitate switching to make sure there is not a cliff edge for customers of those banks, particularly elderly customers who perhaps are not as savvy with digital banking?  Is there anything else the Government could or potentially should be doing to support this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#C00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>We are seeing a larger amount of account closure and shifting in the aftermath of the decision by KBC Bank Ireland and the imminent exit of Ulster Bank.  There are many encouraging signs now regarding the right level of switching activity taking place.  In Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank, in the first eight months of this year, we have now seen more than 600,000 new accounts being opened.  All that being said, however, there is no reason to derive early satisfaction regarding this huge consumer project being complete.  We have a long way to go in that regard, and there are many different consumer issues we need to monitor.<\/p> <p>  What are we going to do about it through our regulator and what are the banks doing in that regard?  There are a number of different things on the way.  First, as the committee will be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland is engaging regularly with the five banks involved in this and is publishing information about what is happening with bank changes and account changes.  Second, a really big advertising campaign is under way.  I, for one, cannot turn on the radio now without hearing this.  It is much needed and it is clear.  Third, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, is now engaging directly with utility providers with regard to making this as clean, clear and simple as possible.  At the same time, the regulator is engaged with the three remaining banks to ensure the right levels of staff and resources are in place to be able to open up the new accounts that will be needed for those who currently bank with KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank.<\/p> <p>  There are, therefore, some signs of progress.  It is far too early to be able to say that we are there on it yet.  In particular, the exit of Ulster Bank and what that means for its existing consumers and customers is one of the biggest things ever to happen in Irish banking from the point of view of the consumer.

The Department of Finance is now a part of that since that recommendation last year.<\/p> <p>  The point I will make to the Minister is that it is clearly not working.  It is clearly failing.  I say that not to score points because this affects all of us.  It is failing because we can see from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, that levels of fraud in the last year have more than doubled.  We can see from details regarding banking fraud that two out of three people in this State are reporting that they have been the subject of an attempted fraud.  We know that different types of fraud that are taking place are also increasing.  There has been an 80% increase in the number of fraudulent scams with people being conned out of &euro;15.6 million.  We have information about unauthorised payment fraud rising by 20% in the last year to more than &euro;41.5 million.  Some 2,375 individuals were the subject of a form of fraud known as authorised push payments where they were tricked into making credit transfers to accounts controlled by fraudsters up to the value of &euro;9.2 million.  These numbers are skyrocketing and it is only going in one direction.  Banks in Britain have called this an issue of national security because it has become so prolific.

Many of these scams happen in texts and phone calls, but some are on online platforms where an individual is tricked into clicking a button and there is phishing going on at the other end of that.

Before I do, I want to remind everyone of what was said by the Central Bank in its headings regarding its key findings.  It said that AIB:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFailed to consider the entitlements of customers when it withdrew the tracker mortgage product ...<br \/><br \/>Breached customers' mortgage contracts, delayed in rectifying the breach, and failed to take immediate and conclusive action to determine for these customers the financial implications of its wrongdoing ...<br \/><br \/>Wrongfully excluded customers' mortgage accounts ...<br \/><br \/>Failed to handle customer complaints in a fair and consistent manner ...<br \/><br \/>Failed to properly manage its mortgage services to customers, resulting in breaches of customers' consumer protection rights [etc.] ... [and]<br \/><br \/>Failed to properly implement the ... Stop the Harm principles. <\/blockquote> <p>That is what the Central Bank said about the tracker mortgage issue and the fine it was imposing on AIB.  It failed its customers.  The Central Bank said that these &quot;failings caused unacceptable harm and loss ... over the course of nearly 18 years&quot; and that AIB's actions had &quot;devastating consequences for its customers&quot;.  If that was said about another company, there would probably be a clear-out of the directors.  Certainly, whoever was left would ask that senior managers would consider their positions at least.  None of that happened.  There were 57 regulatory breaches.  They were fined &euro;119 million but they got a discount of 30%.  I do not know anyone who gets a discount like that when they have done so much damage.  A number of houses were repossessed and a number of families were destroyed - the litany of errors goes on and on.<\/p><p>Now we are asking that same bank with that record to treat fairly the EBS tied agents.  I am not making little of the customers that were affected or any other issues relating to the bank, but that is the backdrop.  That is the EBS.  Through parliamentary questions, I think it was the Minister's Department that informed those who asked that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, would examine the issues they had.  However, IAASA would not do it.  It did not refuse to do it, but it did not actively pursue it.  When it was pushed, it said that it would deal with it but that it would deal with the complaint from the EBS-AIB behind closed doors.<\/p><p>That is what has the country the way it is.  Then the EBS tied agents went to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank will not investigate, even though under section 37 of the Building Societies Act 1989, the Central Bank has to ensure the EBS is financially sound, which brings us back to the root of this problem.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has refused to examine instances where banks have refused to disclose, or disclose correctly, their true financial position.  It goes back to the definition of \"capital losses\" used by the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation as well.  It is not compatible with that of the EU.  Regardless of whether we believe all of what is being said in that, against the backdrop of the activities of AIB it begins to emerge that all of these entities that are supposed to be in charge and have the powers do very little.  They pretend, and people go on suffering.  When I asked AIB about the EBS, it was reluctant to give any real update, because it is in mediation or the process is ongoing.  I consider that response from AIB to be absolutely shambolic.  In the light of all of that, I ask the Minister to tell AIB to stop the carry-on with the EBS tied agents and to bring about a resolution of some sort to the matter, in view of what the Central Bank said about AIB.  I do not know how it can be trusted.

The committee decided earlier that we will invite in some EBS tied agents again to continue to keep the pressure on them.

I am sure that when they read the findings of the Central Bank, they must be utterly disgusted that they are dealing with that type of organisation.  I do not paint all of the employees in AIB with the one brush, but I certainly question the culture of its board and the management.

The Chairman does that well.<\/p> <p>  On what the Central Bank has done, the overall fine that has been imposed is &euro;96.7 million.

From engaging with him, I believe he is committed to trying to bring the tracker mortgage issue to a resolution.  I believe that overall, our regulator has used new and extensive powers that we have made available to it extensively.  I have not always been happy with the engagement between the regulator and our banks, which is why I became involved in this issue a number of years ago.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#K00400","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I have not commented on the work of the Central Bank or, indeed, the man in charge of AIB.  I am talking about the general culture, and the fact that at the end of the day, someone is responsible for it.  It has to be asked why no individual has been held to account, in spite of all of the destruction that all of the banks involved brought on the people of this country, who are supposed to be protected by the Government that they elect.  When representatives of the Central Bank first appeared before the committee, way back at the beginning of this, we were told that there were 3,000 to 4,000 cases, but the regulator was not sure.  In AIB alone, there were over 10,000 cases.  There are still some unresolved cases.  The banks are as difficult now, in bringing about a resolution to those outstanding accounts, as they were at the very beginning of this.  I find that totally unacceptable.  This House, the Minister and the Department are pushed to one side as we leave everything to the regulator.  The Minister is bringing in a new Central Bank Bill.  Will he, in that Bill, give authority to the regulator to say much more about fines that will be imposed in the future?  It is currently restricted, as I understand it, in certain ways.  I believe the public has a right to know what skullduggery was going on in the banks.  The regulator needs to have a freer hand to deal with a greedy industry that seems to have no rules or regulations in-house for itself.  The Minister said that AIB co-operated.  Why would it not co-operate?  We had witnesses all round this room who explained what happened to their homes and their families when AIB stripped them of their tracker mortgages and deprived them of the opportunity to have the matter dealt with.  It ignored its customers' rights.  That is outlined in the statement from the Central Bank.  Will the Minister include, in the new Bill he is bringing forward, far greater powers for the regulator to name and shame any of the banking institutions or anyone else it deals with in relation to this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#K00500","speaker":"1496"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I must have misheard the Chairman earlier, because I did comment on the regulator and AIB and the current CEO of AIB.

I am thinking, in particular, of what used to be known as the penny bank, where one brought one&rsquo;s savings to the community centre and it was lodged then.

I ask, however, that the committee be given some form of update on the discussion that we had here with Mr. Mohan, on his efforts from 2005 up to 2017 when he met with some colleagues and with two Revenue officials, and on what action might or has been taken as a result of that, if we cannot obtain the full report.  Perhaps the Minister might arrange to give us an indicative position, please, on where the complaint went to because it had to do with a loss of revenue for the State.  That is the interest I have in the matter, together with the fact that the treatment of taxpayers generally should be the same.
