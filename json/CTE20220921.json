I am joined by Ms Teresa Morrissey and Ms Catherine McManus.<\/p> <p>  There is a critical need for a commitment from the Government to ensure the economic potential and sustainable future of the Irish aquaculture industry is realised.  Immediate action to implement a functioning aquaculture licensing system must be a key priority for any future development of the Irish aquaculture industry, including appropriate legislative changes required to facilitate this.  The full implementation of the aquaculture licensing review, published in 2017, must be prioritised and actioned to allow for effective implementation of the actions proposed in the draft seafood development programme 2021-27 and the draft national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development 2030.  The Irish aquaculture sector needs the support of policy in order to achieve any realistic sustainable development so as to unlock any future potential of the Irish aquaculture industry.<\/p> <p>  Recommendations and priorities for development of sustainable aquaculture outlined in several Government policy documents.  The Review of the Aquaculture Licensing Process, the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development, the Report of the Seafood Task Force - Navigating Change, and the A Programme for a Partnership Government speak of developing a thriving and dynamic Irish aquaculture sector not limited by quota.  Production targets outlined in Ireland's Response the Commission's Green Paper on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2013 will not be achieved.  Aquaculture production has stagnated in recent years, with no significant increase in production figures despite EU and national policy objectives aiming to increase sustainable aquaculture development.<\/p> <p>  Targets to increase production and develop the Irish aquaculture industry have not been met.  The target at the beginning of the previous European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, programme 2015-21 was to increase production by 45,000 tonnes, from 36,000 tonnes in 2012 to a predicted 81,000 tonnes in 2023.  By the end of 2018, production had decreased by 7,000 tonnes on 2012 levels, estimated at over &euro;105 million in product value.  By the end of 2020, Irish aquaculture production had further decreased in volume on 2012 levels, and for most of that period Irish aquaculture production remained static as opposed to increasing.  The cumulative loss to the sector is estimated in excess of &euro;570 million over the period at the prevailing in-year price.<\/p> <p>  Eligibility criteria for funding schemes under the previous EMFF operational programme was hindered by the fact that most of industry was ineligible for grant aid due to state aid rules related to aquaculture licensing, which was outside of the industry&rsquo;s control.  Given that this is the main financial source to ensure effective implementation of the common fisheries policy, CFP, available for the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector, it is imperative that access to the available funds are facilitated at every possible opportunity.<\/p><p>To give further context to the lost opportunity of Irish aquaculture over the period of the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, programme, as global aquaculture production grew by an average of 5.3 % per year in the period from 2001 to 2018, Ireland has not matched this trend in aquaculture production growth.  Ireland has gone from having 5% of European aquaculture production 20 years ago to less than 2.5% currently.  However, Ireland is now the most significant aquaculture producer in the EU since the departure of the UK after Brexit.  Ireland accounts for over 24% of total EU organic aquaculture production across all species, with Irish organic salmon making up the majority of the production volume.  This is despite Ireland&rsquo;s overall aquaculture production, particularly salmon production, having being reduced in recent years.  <\/p><p> Irish aquaculture production is very good value for the amount of licensed area currently in operation.  The Business of Seafood 2021 report by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, shows that 90 sq. km of licensed area yielded 38,000 tonnes worth &euro;175 million in value to the Irish economy.  The majority of that value, that is &euro;109 million, came from Irish organic salmon.  Irish aquaculture produce accounts for over 20% of the total Irish seafood exports from the three main export species, with more than 80% of this aquaculture produce being exported to the value of &euro;150 million.  The Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, estimates that Irish aquaculture could contribute more than &euro;500 million in direct farm gate income and a further &euro;500 million in ancillary activity, that is marine engineering and seafood processing, mostly generated from export trade.  This value and volume of Irish aquaculture production could be significantly increased by optimising the existing licensed aquaculture space and allowing licence conditions to adapt to innovative and efficient aquaculture production systems.  Most important, unlike targets and speculative statements on increasing aquaculture production of the past, we need to be more specific, ambitious, and realistic.  <\/p><p> The Irish aquaculture industry provides essential support and employment opportunities for rural coastal communities with almost 2,000 direct jobs and over 16,000 indirect jobs in seafood processing and marine ancillary services sectors.  With a multiplier effect average of 1.5, a sustainable Irish aquaculture industry has huge potential to create employment opportunities and further enhance coastal communities both through direct employment and indirect employment in marine industries and marine ancillary services.  <\/p><p> With considerable investment in and appropriate legislative changes to the Irish aquaculture sector, there can be significant increases in direct and indirect employment, volume and value of aquaculture production.  IFA Aquaculture believes in the future of rural coastal communities, and industries such as aquaculture are imperative for the vitality of these communities.  <\/p><p> In short, we are lacking a coherent, realistic and ambitious policy for Irish aquaculture.  The current policies and objectives in relation to aquaculture are non-binding and non-specific in terms of targets and are coupled with numerous policies and regulations that are not streamlined.  There needs to be a realistic EU and national policy to develop the aquaculture sector that facilitates the sustainable development of Irish aquaculture.  <\/p><p> IFA Aquaculture has the following recommendations.  We recommend the implementation of the recommendations in the review of the Irish aquaculture licensing report.  There are several issues in relation to the lack of progress on a number of the recommendations outlined in the review of the aquaculture licensing process, where the report concluded in 2017 that the aquaculture licensing system was in urgent need of reform.  The report also explicitly states the Minister \"will assign responsibility for recommendations, accountability and set milestones for delivery and identify the necessary resources to support the implementation process\".  The recommendations of the aquaculture licensing review need to be prioritised, resourced, and implemented urgently with greater stakeholder engagement regarding an implementation plan and realistic timelines for completion. This would include the re-establishment of the aquaculture licensing advisory committee, ALAC. <\/p><p> Recommendation 8.16 of the review of the aquaculture licensing process report recommended \"work to commence immediately on the preparation of new aquaculture legislation\".  Since the report was published, a further number of EU and national legislative policies have been given effect, many mentioned previously in this statement.  Most specifically, the recent marine planning and development management Bill could be viewed as a missed opportunity for Irish aquaculture reform, regulation and development management due the exclusion of the sector from the legislation.  Aquaculture legislation, both primary and secondary, has been amended numerous times, in particular to give effect to EU environmental legislation, making it difficult to follow and establish the current status of various provisions.<\/p><p> Regarding the inclusion of aquaculture in the marine planning and development management Bill, IFA Aquaculture has serious concerns regarding the exclusion of aquaculture from this Bill.  The national marine planning framework, NMPF, aims to introduce a single development management process for the maritime area for activities or developments.  This is underpinned by legislation introduced in the form of the maritime area planning Bill which aims to establish a new regulatory body in the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA.  This will not include aquaculture or fisheries, as they are not legislated for as part of the Bill.  Aquaculture and fisheries must be included in associated national marine spatial planning legislation as it is essential for the fair and correct development management of the marine space.  <\/p><p> A coherence of policies through the open method of co-ordination in relation to aquaculture continues to be absent.  Alignment and coherence of aquaculture objectives with EU environmental regulations and directives is a key challenge and the level of coherence between different EU policies should be assessed on a sector-by-sector basis.  The aquaculture sector complies with obligations, particularly environmental objectives, outlined in a number of policies and regulations i.e. the habitats directive; the birds directive; consolidated environmental impact assessment directive; marine strategy framework directive; marine spatial planning directive; water framework directive; and the Common Fisheries Policy.  <\/p><p> Irish Aquaculture operators and their businesses will no longer be profitable unless there are significant supports during this time of crisis to assist with spiralling input costs.  Earlier this year the European Commission activated a crisis mechanism of the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF, to enable member states to grant financial compensation to aquaculture operators for income foregone and additional costs due to the current market disruption.  The EMFAF crisis mechanism is a temporary measure and applies retrospectively as of 24 February 2022 and will be in place until the end of the year.  IFA Aquaculture is calling on the Government to consider these funding mechanisms made available by the European Commission to assist Irish aquaculture operators affected by these severe cost increases.  This must be done without delay.  <\/p><p> In conclusion, it is now critical that a single piece of legislation is brought forward to implement and underpin appropriate aquaculture policy and to bring together all the existing primary, secondary and amended legislation in one single provision.  In summary, if the objectives and specific actions outlined in the Seafood Development Programme 2021-2027, the national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture and the Report of the Seafood Task Force are to be most effective for the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry, an immediate effort must be made to reform, modernise, and improve the aquaculture licensing system.  Reducing the administrative burden and having an efficient, transparent aquaculture licensing system is of benefit to regulators, the industry, and aquaculture stakeholders alike.  That concludes our opening statement.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Mulloy for the very comprehensive submission.

If we look at other European countries, Norway, with a population not significantly higher than Ireland's, produces 1.5 million tonnes compared with 14,000 tonnes here.  Iceland stands out as it produced a similar amount of tonnage in 2017 but by 2020, the figure doubled to 40,000 tonnes.  While Ireland's tonnage decreased from 20,000 to 14,000, Iceland's tonnage increased from around the same figure to 40,000.  It is a dramatic picture.  If we take the 2017 figures, production declined in very few European countries, so it really stands out.  The comparisons with Norway and Iceland in particular are alarming in terms of the potential aquaculture has for costal communities.  I have seen it in my home county of Donegal with a company now called Mowi, previously known as Marine Harvest.  Ms McManus is the leading light in the company in Ireland. <\/p><p> What is going wrong?  In the previous D&aacute;il, the agriculture committee engaged with the then Minister and his Department officials and asked for the implementation of the independent agriculture report.  One of the major issues then was resourcing the agriculture appeals process.  Just to be clear, the Oireachtas believes that every citizen has a right to object to a planning application.  However, it should be done in a timely fashion.  If aquaculture or seafood companies are being asked to go out to Asia, for example, to find new markets and create new jobs in Ireland, those new markets need to know there is a sustainable product and that its delivery and pipeline will be sustained over a period of time.<\/p><p> My apologies for giving a commentary rather than asking questions.  I did not intend to do that but the statistics are very stark.  The good news story, which is to be welcomed, is in the organic area.  It would be good to talk about why that has been a success and what we need to do to maintain that success.  There are positives in this story but unfortunately it is a negative story overall in terms of the capacity.  Iceland and Norway produce 1.5 million tonnes and 40,000 tonnes, respectively, whereas the most recent figures for Ireland show we are down to 14,000 tonnes.<\/p><p> What can the Government do to turn this around to support the sustainable development of the industry?  Why were the production targets that were set not achieved?  How can we facilitate finfish aquaculture development?  What should we do regarding the divergence between the targets and what is actually being delivered?  My questions are linked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#L00300","speaker":"1463","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The industry was faced with the challenge of old licences.  Many of the finfish licences under which the industry currently operates were granted in the 1980s and 1990s.  This industry is very dynamic, quick to adapt and innovative.  In the past 20 to 30 years, the methods of production have changed, with the focus now more on sustainable production.  We have learned very quickly.  Norway has been the leader in that and we have learned from our neighbours.  The investment and support of Norwegian industry are what have kept the finfish sector alive in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  We have been stuck with these very old licences granted at a time when many of the European environmental directives and objectives were not established.  Many were granted when we did not even have designated areas of conservation or special protection areas.  None of these were in existence in Ireland at the time.  Since the late 1990s, we have new environmental legislation and industry must comply with it.  Another point to be made about the old licences is that there is no uniformity in how they were described or the conditions attached to them.  They could vary from site to site or from county to county.  Old technology such as the use of wooden pens was prescribed in some licences and we know we could never survive with that condition nowadays.  In other cases, the prescribed numbers of fish, the ages of fish and the maximum amount that could be harvested.  When these conditions were all put together, none of it made sense environmentally.  The industries had to dial back production to comply with European legislation and directives.<\/p> <p>   The other issue we have had to deal with is that most of the production in Ireland - more than 80% - is exported.  We are competing on global markets with our neighbours, including Scotland, the Faroe Islands, which are smaller than Ireland but have more production, and Norway, and even with Canada, Chile and other such countries.  As a result of their more progressive licensing systems, they can produce more fish sustainably, at a lower cost, than we can in Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The Irish industry had to adapt very quickly and find a niche, which is where the organic story comes in.  Clew Bay was where organic farming, particularly of salmon, started way back in the 1990s.  The Irish were the pioneers of organic salmon production globally.  We should have continued to lead the way but because of the licensing system and lack of progression with it, and the old licences we had been left with, we stagnated.  One of the cornerstones of organic principles is lower stocking intensity.  We had to make do with old licences within very confined foreshore areas.  At the same time, we had to reinvent ourselves to try to make a margin elsewhere.  This is where the whole organic production came in.  We then had 100% of the industry producing to organic principles and that gave us a competitive edge over Norway, Scotland and so on.  That has now been eroded because the other countries see what Ireland has done and they are doing it at a lower cost than us now.  This is a huge threat.  What is behind that is that the licensing system in Ireland has not kept pace with the development of the industry along sustainability principles.  That is where we are at.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the length of time it takes to get a licence in Ireland, the entire industry applied for renewal of its old licences over many years and they have still not been reviewed.  We have also applied for licences to be reviewed with modern conditions included.  We want to operate to a maximum available biomass which the site or water body has been scientifically shown it can cope with quite healthily.  This has been a slow process.  It has definitely sped up over the past two years but it is complicated because the finfish industry requires environmental impact assessment reports to support these revisions of licences.  These are complicated detailed documents requiring the input of many experts such as archeologists, marine biologists and oceanographers.  A lot of effort, expense and time goes into preparing these documents.  We cannot just whip them out or produce them in a short space of time.  This has been a concern.<\/p> <p>  In our experience, it takes at least 11 years to get a brand-new licence for a site.  The Deputy can do the sums but in those 11 years, the rest of the European industry will be racing ahead and filling the gaps Ireland cannot fill, particularly in the organic sphere.<\/p><p>The Irish industry has paved the way for the marketing of organic salmon.  We have put in a lot of effort with the support of Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and others to market Irish organic fish and shellfish abroad.  Now other countries are coming in on the coat tails of the efforts made by our sector so we are losing ground and we appeal to the powers that be to implement the suggested reforms in the review of the aquaculture licensing process.  I think there are about 30 recommendations in that.  We need to see all of these implemented and we need legislative reform.  It is very important.  Otherwise we will just not be in position in another ten years.  We will not be able to compete on cost, particularly these days when we are faced with soaring energy costs.  Even our feed costs have gone up by about 30%.  Feed alone makes up about 50% of our overall production costs.  On top of all of that, it is a business for which you need deep pockets because for the technology and infrastructure needed to set up a modest farm, you are talking about at least &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million just to establish and equip a site.  On top of all of that, you need all the ancillary equipment, boats, craft and so on.  It is technology-intensive.  We also rely on good people on the coast - people who want to live on the western seaboard - and this is getting more and more difficult due to cost of living reasons.  All sectors face difficulties recruiting people.  We have a good and sustainable way of life that is certainly very compatible with the west coast of Ireland in terms of crofting, small farmers and the seafaring aspect of the coast line and we do not want to lose it because it would be very difficult to get that back.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>In its presentation, the IFA dealt with the fact that it is dealing with so many European directives.

It is essential and we have now implemented it in Ireland.  We were one of the first to have a national marine planning framework and national legislation underpinning that.  The complexity in terms of MARA and what it means not just for aquaculture but fisheries, although we are the only licensed activity on the foreshore that will be affected by this, is that we are not legislated for.  We were excluded from the marine spatial planning legislation.  We are included in the national marine planning framework in that aquaculture and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine have to sign up to the policies, principles and objectives of the national marine planning framework but the legislation underpinning that, which means you must adhere to it, excludes aquaculture.  Those policies and principles are really ineffective and meaningless in terms of aquaculture if they are not underpinned by legislation, which they are not.  What this essentially means is that we are excluded from MARA, which will be established next year.  This is a real concern because we do not know where that will leave aquaculture when it comes to access to space, the marine spatial plan and the planning process when it comes to the marine space because we were separated from that process.  We will see offshore wind and other industries being developed and managed by one singular body and rightly so.  Everything you read about marine spatial planning and the national marine planning framework will tell you that it is a one-stop-shop - a single point for regulation across the marine space - but this is simply not true because it does not include the two main seafood industries, namely, fisheries and aquaculture, so that is a concern.<\/p> <p>  That aside, in terms of legislation for aquaculture, we are legislated for under a number of amendments in the Fisheries Act that make it quite cumbersome to understand what the legislation and regulation around aquaculture is.  Quite unusually, in many places where I speak, and I am a member of the marine spatial planning advisory group, I am one of the few lobbyists looking for more regulation for our sector.  That is essentially what we are looking for.  We are looking for more regulation because we are not satisfied with the regulation we have.  We cannot stand over it as an industry.  The State is only able to stand over it, which causes issues with stakeholders looking in and members of the public who quite rightly are entitled to see what the process around aquaculture licensing and the production thereof is.  It makes it quite difficult for us even to stand over it because the regulatory system is so broken.  It needs reform because it is essential for our sustainable development.  The draft national strategic plan for aquaculture is under public consultation until the end of this month.  That is our main policy document until 2030.  For the guts of the next ten years, that will be our main policy document.  Much of the direction of travel and recommendations in that strategy, which will be funded mainly by the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, simply cannot be implemented without sufficient legislative reform.  If the legislation is not there to underpin the strategy in that, some of it simply cannot happen so it is vital that we have that reform.  One of the recommendations in that strategy involves reviewing the legislation and not to start that review until 2025.  The review for aquaculture licensing was 2017 and now we are taking the legislation in 2025.  We really need to see urgency from the Department and the Government on this issue.  Otherwise a lot of the very good progress that can be made from the aquaculture industry simply will not be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Morrissey"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>From the heart of the midlands, this meeting has been very educational because, obviously, we do not have many fish farms.

What happened in Ireland in 2017 such that there was a massive drop from 20,000 to 13,000 tonnes?  This probably leads on to my next question.  Ms McManus said that the set-up cost for a fish farm is &euro;6 million.  Could she give us an overview of who the players in this field are?  Are we talking about one company or two or three companies driving the market or are we talking about community operations?  Could Ms McManus paint a picture regarding who is involved in this sector?<\/p> <p>  Could she also tell us more about the number of operators and the number of people employed in the industry?  I am sure it is the way it is presented but I am struggling with it.  The sector has had to scale back its costs.  Has Ms McManus seen a drop off in the numbers of people employed in the sector?<\/p> <p>  Ms McManus rightly said that Norway and the Faroe Islands are replicating what we are doing.  This happens in every business.  Someone copies a successful model.  However, these countries have also done something such that they are able to scale up their operations.  What are they doing that the EU and Ireland in particular need to do?<\/p><p>My final question is on licensing.  I was horrified to hear that it could take 11 years and a &euro;6 million start-up cost to get a licence.  Ms Morrissey<font color=\"#444444\">\u00a0<\/font>will probably be able to answer that.  On the regulatory authority, is it an issue that there are serial objectors in this matter, is it an environmental issue or is it tactical by others not necessarily in the industry, but rivals?  What is the motivation for these objections and for hindering?  I would like to thank the witnesses.  It has been very educational and I hope they will educate me further with their answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#N00400","speaker":"1597","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":24,"content":"<p>We will split this one for the responses to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":25,"content":"<p>Share the love.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O00300","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":26,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for his very interesting questions.

Aquaculture is both shellfish and finfish.  Finfish is the most valuable species harvested.  Shellfish, by volume, is the biggest industry.  Shellfish value to volume is lower than that of salmon.  In the EU context, with the departure of Great Britain, Ireland is the biggest producer of Atlantic salmon.  Obviously, Norway and Iceland are not in the EU.<\/p> <p>  European shellfish production has flatlined.  There are lots of reasons for that.  Some are put down to global warming, others to water quality.  Ireland has a great opportunity to improve its production of shellfish in particular and finfish because it is perceived as a very clean area to operate with low industry and generally good water quality and good environmental standards.  We in the industry would see that we are missing out on a huge opportunity there.  In Europe, they have older, traditional industries, but they have generally matured.  That is the most accurate summary I can give.<\/p> <p> On the salmon production drop and employment figures, I think Ms McManus will be able to discuss why, in 2017, there was a drop in the production of salmon while Ms Morrissey can address the other question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>I can address the drop in production.

The licence is not just confined to or does not just stipulate how many fish you should have in the water; it also limits the amount of foreshore that you can occupy.  As we stock our fish at half the density of production of Scotland, Norway or the Faroe Islands, for example, we have to do half the volume in the same space we are licensed for.  We would like to spread out more to double our production across a bigger area.  It is really to do with space.  We are limited by acreage and that is why the licences need to be completely reviewed and reformed in order that we can operate on a maximum allowable biomass, MAB, basis.<\/p> <p>  There are four to five main operators in the industry.  It started back in the late 1970s and early 1980s with a number of small operators or individual entrepreneurs who took a risk to set up either trout or salmon farms.  As time went on and the industry moved from inshore production to more nearshore production, they realised that to stay at sea and to keep their crop at sea, they would have to invest in serious technology.  This is where the Norwegians came in.  The company I work for was formerly called Fanad Fisheries.  It joined up with a company called Mowi ASA in Norway at the time in the 1980s to bring in new technology and expertise, particularly in breeding.  That is how the relationship began.  The Norwegians are significant investors in the industry in Ireland.  It is capital intensive and not for the faint-hearted.  It has gone from a small, family operation to something much bigger.  The farms that were licensed over the years have more or less consolidated into four main companies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":32,"content":"<p>Are those companies Irish-owned?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01200","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":33,"content":"<p>In our case, we are Norwegian-owned, but it is completely staffed by Irish people and has Irish management; it always has been.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01300","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":34,"content":"<p>What about the other three?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":35,"content":"<p>It is the same for the other three.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01500","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":36,"content":"<p>They are Norwegian-owned and Irish-managed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01600","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":37,"content":"<p>No, one of them is a family-owned operation that has interests in other fishery sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01700","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":38,"content":"<p>There are Irish shareholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":39,"content":"<p>Yes, there are Irish shareholders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O01900","nonspeaker":"Ms Catherine McManus"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>Did the Deputy want to discuss the organic model in greater depth?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O02000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I would like to know about the learnings from Norway regarding how they managed to scale up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#O02100","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":42,"content":"<p>The key difference with Norway is it blessed with a coastline that is very deep; its fjords can be up to 500 m deep.

That meant that people who were in business, like me - I have been a mussel farmer for 40 years, as the Deputy knows; I am from his constituency - had aquaculture licences dating from the 1980s and we could not renew them in the 1990s.  We were operating without a proper licence for about 15 years.  We were treated under section 19(a), which was a provision in the Act that an operator could continue to operate pending a renewal.  However, in that intervening time, despite the fact that European money was available to support and stimulate aquaculture, we could not avail of that money.  It was not available to an operation that was not fully licensed, and the majority of the shellfish industry was not fully licensed at that time.

It is not a decision of the European Commission even though it involves European funds.<\/p> <p>  As regards engaging with the Department and its officials, they are engaging with us now.  Engagement has greatly improved.  There was probably a difficult period for a number of years where very little meaningful engagement took place.  A basic level of engagement did occur but we have certainly improved our relationships and I am happy to say engagement has improved, particularly over the past 12 months.  However, we would like to see a lot more action and the Deputy's suggestion that Department officials be invited to the committee to examine how best we could move forward would be helpful.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Flaherty mentioned job creation.  We are directly responsible for about 2,000 jobs.  That number could be significantly higher if the licensing issue were ironed out and if policy and regulatory reform were brought about.  We could create jobs directly and indirectly.  The seafood task force report was published last year as a result of the Brexit for fisheries to see how best we can move forward with the Irish seafood industry.  Aquaculture's involvement in the seafood task force involved examining how best aquaculture can alleviate and take up some of the pressures that will arise from the loss of jobs and the displacement of jobs, especially indirect employment, as a result of the Brexit fisheries deal.  Aquaculture can make up that shortfall by providing employment in marine engineering, seafood processing, and providing the product for seafood processing that will be lost because of the lost quota in fisheries as a result of Brexit.  That was our input to the seafood task force and a number of recommendations were included that relate to job creation in the seafood industry.  Aquaculture is the only other seafood producing industry aside from fisheries, which obviously brings fish into the ports and, as we know, has lost some of its quota.  As I said, the national strategic plan will not happen unless the regulatory reform is brought about.  We will not be able to create those jobs.  There is a lot of very positive speak in the seafood task force report, but it will not happen unless it is brought about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#P00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Teresa Morrissey"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":49,"content":"<p>To complete the answer to Deputy Ring's question about the status of the aquaculture licensing review report, it is not really fair to say nothing has happened.  The backlog of shellfish licences has been dealt with.  It could be argued that was the low-hanging fruit and that was dealt with at the expense of the finfish industry.  Obviously, the licence applications and determinations for finfish are severely more complicated than shellfish licences.  We have a situation where a lot of shellfish licences have been issued, which is a good thing.  We welcome it, obviously.  However, unfortunately no finfish licences have been determined, bar one, but that is under appeal, or rather is beyond appeal.  It is being judicially reviewed.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Flaherty spoke about the tactical motivation for objectors.  We have a problem in that if we were to streamline and improve the process, we could improve the image of the whole industry.  If the licensing process was more transparent, people would feel that we were dealing on a fairer playing pitch.  At the moment the public consultation process is poor.  Adverts are put in local newspapers, often at the end of the year when they want to complete the body of work and people's eyes are off the ball, and before they know it, a fish farm is happening and nobody knows about it.  Part of the licensing review report encourages the practice of pre-planning, which is an obvious and accepted part of the planning process.  We want Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, to take on a role in the pre-planning process so that the local aquaculture officers around the coast can help applicants make an appropriate application in consultation with the other stakeholders in their immediate vicinity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2022092100002#P00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Mulloy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":50,"content":"<p>As regards the work schedule, will we be able to invite the Department to the committee?

The Minister is here to discuss the school transport issue.  As we all know, this issue has dominated the headlines, especially in rural communities, over the last two months.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister to make a brief opening statement.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.

To assist me, I am joined by officials from my Department, Ms Conduit, who is an assistant secretary general, and Ms Kearney, who is a principal officer.<\/p> <p>  The school transport scheme is an administrative scheme that was established in 1968.  It was created to facilitate access to primary and post-primary education for children who, because of where they reside, might have difficulty attending school regularly otherwise.  The scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the 2021-22 school year, over 121,400 children and young people, including more than 15,500 with special educational needs, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  In 2021, the total cost of providing school transport amounted to &euro;289 million.  This includes direct transport services and grant payments.  It also includes funding to schools for the employment of escorts to accompany children with special educational needs whose care and safety needs require this support.<\/p> <p>  In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost-of-living measures.  In the context of increasing costs of living, with a view to easing the financial burden on families, I announced measures to reduce the cost to families for school transport services.  These temporary measures were in addition to the reduction in the family cap announced by the Government in February 2022 to mitigate the cost of living and provided for the waiver of ticket charges for the 2022-23 school year.  These measures will provide families with savings of up to &euro;500 on the cost of tickets.  Originally, this was &euro;650 prior to the introduction of the cap.<\/p> <p>  School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications or registrations were received for mainstream school transport.  This figure includes 44,299 new applications, as well as rollovers from the previous school year.  Some 124,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have already been issued to applicants for the 2022-23 school year.  At the beginning of the last school year, approximately 103,600 children were carried on mainstream school transport services, so in the region of 20,400 additional places have already been created.  The temporary waiving of fees has led to an unprecedented expansion of the scheme, with many more eligible and concessionary applicants receiving tickets than ever before.  There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties, with an increase of 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils compared with the position at the beginning of the 2021-22 school year, and an increase of 27% in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils compared with the 2021-22 school year.  Notwithstanding this, I acknowledge that the huge increase in applications has led to frustration over delays issuing tickets in some instances.<\/p> <p>  I assure the committee that Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to work intensively in all regions to process applications and issue tickets as soon as buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport for the higher numbers qualifying for the service.  It is important to note that the normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with these criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, the nearest primary school.  At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest or next-nearest post-primary school are deemed eligible.  Any pupils or students who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants and are allocated a ticket based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.<\/p> <p>  There has been an unprecedented increase in applications from families whose children are eligible for school transport this year.  These children must be prioritised as the scheme dictates.  I am aware that this has led to particular frustration this year for some families whose children attend their third-, fourth- or even fifth-closest school or live within the distance limits, who held tickets previously and did not receive one this year.  This is directly due to the much higher numbers of eligible children applying.  These children must be facilitated.  I know that many families, whatever their eligibility status, rely on the scheme and this consideration is being factored into the analysis under way as part of the review of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  For this year, in line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year will be accommodated on school transport services, where such services are in operation.  In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will continue for the 2022-23 school year.<\/p><p>Under these measures transport is provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school.  They must have applied by 29 April 2022 and registered for a ticket by 29 July 2022.  The online account management system, known as the family portal, which had been closed since registration shut, on 29 July, reopened on Thursday, 25 August 2022.  The reopening of the portal will enable account holders to check the status of applications which have been processed.  While the reopening of the portal also facilitates the late applications process, it is very important for families to note that the application deadline for the 2022-2023 year was 29 April 2022 and the deadline to confirm registration was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is a late application.  Therefore many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.  Late applications can only be assessed after all on-time applications have been processed.  Places are not guaranteed for late applicants.  <\/p><p> The Department is continuing to conduct a review of the school transport scheme which includes an examination of the current scheme and how it currently operates; its broader effectiveness and sustainability; and whether it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.  The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes including eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost-drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the scheme.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services.<\/p><p> Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of this, the technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students who use the service as well as those who do not use the service but would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.  While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme.  The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.  <\/p><p> Once again I thank the committee for the invitation to appear here today and I am happy to answer questions and deal with any queries that committee members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#B00100","nonspeaker":"Deputy Norma Foley (Minister for Education)","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":122,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

I suppose the main reason we are here is around the fact that people are not getting the school bus who got the school bus before.  Even within my own family, we got a ticket despite the fact the school has moved and is now closer to our home, so there is no need for a school bus.  We did not apply for a school bus but we got a ticket.  Can the Minister address the issue of the failures within the process?  The first is that we have people who are getting the school bus who do not need it and did not apply for it.  What has happened there?

There are five, six or seven things that must happen each a morning, as I am sure the Minister knows.  Those people feel particularly let down.

I agree with his comment that the school transport system is beneficial and important.  The Deputy referred to capacity.  We have already seen an increase of more than 21% in capacity.  As I said, 124,000 young people are now availing of that transport system, as opposed to 103,000 this time last year.  Those who qualify to avail of it meet the criteria.  The criteria for eligibility, as the Deputy is aware, are that the child must live within 3.2 km of a primary school or 4.8 km of the nearest or next nearest post-primary school.  The criteria are clear.  We are in the throes of considering the criteria, going forward.  They are subject to review.  It was not possible at this time to change the criteria because that would not have been fair.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy specifically referenced concessionary places.  Children receive concessionary access to transport where there is additional capacity on the bus.  That happened last year and is happening again this year.  It is interesting to note there has been an increase of one third in concessionary availability this year.  The Deputy and any other public representative will be aware that there can be late application for eligibility.  There can be individual circumstances in a family that mean there is a need for a late application.  Something may have happened.  Perhaps there is an illness in a family.  There are myriad circumstances that could mean someone who is eligible was not in a position to apply on time.  They remain eligible if they meet the criteria.  Concessionary places will, of course, be accommodated where there is additional capacity.  As I have said, some children who may be allowed a concessionary place have not been successful.  It is difficult to ascertain why people fall under the concessionary label.  Some do not meet the criteria for eligibility.  Others are attending their fourth, fifth or sixth nearest school.  In the context of the upcoming budget, I am in discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, to see if there is potential to accommodate the cohort who have previously availed of a concessionary place, where there is capacity.

We should prioritise those who are eligible at that stage subsequent to filling the places with those who applied on time.

I would like to welcome the Minister.  I will ask my questions together, so I will not need to come back in.<\/p> <p>  I really appreciate the good intent behind the 5 July announcement.  As a cost-of-living measure, it has certainly had a huge impact on many families, in that there are 124,000 students availing of it.  Many families have had savings of up to &euro;500, which is significant.  Unfortunately, there are a number of families for whom this has come at a cost.  Despite the 21% increase in capacity, which is very welcome, there have been consequences - unintended, I have no doubt.  I have spoken to families and public representatives in Kildare and around the country about this.  People are at a complete loss.  There are families that have had concessionary tickets for years, but now do not.  There are families where some children have received tickets and some have not.  There are families that have had to take annual leave to try to ensure their children get to school and there are some families that are envisaging getting a second car to bring their children to school.  This is a cost-of-living measure, but we are trying to take extra cars off the road.<\/p> <p>  The fact we are debating this in the fourth week back to school is simply is not good enough.  All these issues should be resolved in July and August.  The fact is that children and their families are trying to deal with this on a day-to-day basis and are being stressed by it.<\/p> <p>  I totally accept the Minister has inherited this system and that she has undertaken the review, which will, I hope, see some changes brought in.  We should not be using words like \"eligible\" or \"concessionary\".  This should be a demand-led service that anybody in need should be able to avail of to get to school.  We should call it \"public transport\" as opposed to \"school transport\".  The Minister is correct in what she said about looking at other types of public transport and seeing where we can be in the future.<\/p> <p>  When does the Minister anticipate that the review findings will be published?  Will we, as a committee, have an opportunity to be part of that process?  That is going to be significant and will, I hope, overcome many of the challenges that we have at the moment.<\/p> <p>  On this particular issue, I want to ask the Minister about planning.  While numbers are going to vary from year to year, surely the Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann should be in a position where planning takes place the previous year.  On the consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann, was there any analysis of data from previous years in terms of the number of people who would possibly avail of this?  I would contend that those who applied before 29 April should have gotten their tickets prior to it being reopened.<\/p><p>Communications have been poor.  I appreciate that both the Minister's office and Bus &Eacute;ireann have received an onslaught of communications from families and public representatives, but the fact that people are not receiving responses from Bus &Eacute;ireann is not good enough.<\/p><p> As regards procuring buses and drivers, while I appreciate  the situation with tour buses is different now, we were able to provide extra buses during Covid.  I ask that the Minister considers allowing drivers over 70 years of age to drive school buses as they are banned at the moment.  The same drivers can bring youngsters to school matches, on tours, etc., but they cannot drive school buses.<\/p><p> Anecdotally, I have heard of tickets being issued to people who did not apply.  I have also heard, although I cannot prove it, that some people have used incorrect or previous addresses to be able to meet eligibility criteria.  The suggestion has been made to me that proof of address, via a utility bill from the previous year, should be requested.<\/p><p> My final point relates to county borders.  A person cannot apply for transport to a school within their county if a school across the border is the nearest school to them.  A number of areas must be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#F00900","speaker":"1689","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":160,"content":"<p>The Senator mentioned the timing of this.  To be clear, this is a cost-of-living measure.  The Government has introduced a package worth in excess of &euro;2.4 billion.  A previous school transport measure reduced the cap from &euro;650 to &euro;500.  We were alerted to an opportunity for further measures to be put in place.  In consequence of that money becoming available, we looked at a variety of options, most notably school transport.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct to refer to the review.  Nobody is more conscious than I am of the necessity for the review.  I initiated this root and branch review.  As I have previously articulated, it involves engagement with all of the stakeholders, including parents, students, bus providers, our European counterparts and a significant body of analysis is involved in that.  I expect it will be completed before the year's end.  That is what we are working towards.  Having said that, we have been impacted by some issues, most notably the war in Ukraine, but we are proceeding and the work continues.<\/p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann acknowledges the communication difficulties because of the unprecedented demand and it has apologised for these.  We engaged with Bus &Eacute;ireann and provided additional resources, including staffing, so that a call centre could be put in place.  It is my understanding that all calls to that centre are now being answered in a timely fashion.<\/p> <p>  The issue of the over 70s has been raised previously.  Bus &Eacute;ireann makes that decision from a health and safety point of view.  It is its call.  Its view is that the threshold is particularly high when it comes to children and young adults being transported in the bus.  It states that it keeps everything under review but that is its health and safety judgment at this point.  However, everything is kept under review.<\/p> <p>  I am not aware of people providing false addresses.  If the Senator is aware of any specific instances, she might communicate that to the Department.<\/p> <p>  Consultation with Bus &Eacute;ireann happens on an ongoing basis, particularly with my officials.  Consultation regarding how things would operate took place in advance of the announcement.  I wish to acknowledge that Bus &Eacute;ireann has a track record of service and flexibility in service.  I have previously made this point.  Only a few days before the return to school, we were informed by public health that we would have to move to 50% capacity on buses.  Bus &Eacute;ireann embraced that and worked through it.  We have seen a 21% increase-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#G00200","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":161,"content":"<p>Minister, I will have to cut you off.

There was a joint Commencement matter in the Seanad last week and this evening we have a Fine Gael motion on school transport.  We are calling for an additional budget to manage the shortfall in respect of students.  There are more than 6,000 students and behind each application there is a family with a story to tell.  The Minister has had a fantastic initiative to reduce the cost of living but I refer to the process alone - the rollover of applications, parents paying for tickets, refunds being given and suddenly no spaces available.  Everyone now knows what concessionary and eligible mean but there was a level of expectation among parents whose children have had that ticket for the last four to five years.  There was not proper notification to families and that is a responsibility that lies with Government.  There is a level of expectation, and that is one of the key parts to everything that has happened this year.<\/p> <p>  Rural areas, in particular, have been impacted, including in Galway and Roscommon.  We want to see more families living in the west but we need the services.  There are have huge issues for families whose children have been trying to get to secondary schools, particularly around Mountbellew, Ballygar, Athlone and Ballinasloe.  The Minister has heard some of the stories, but some of the stories I hear include one where a mother literally gave up work nursing in a hospital because she could not go to work because she had to bring the kids to school.  There is family facing an extra 60 km per day in travel to bring the kids to school.  There is a single mum with three children, one getting the bus, one who cannot, and one with special needs.  There are parents who do not want their children on the bus because of the shame of the children being asked to get off the bus by the inspector or the bus driver.<\/p> <p>  The majority of these issues are at post-primary level.  It does not appear to be an issue at primary level but it is at post-primary level and in rural areas.  I have been at public meetings and I have spoken to the Minister about those issues.  Parents are angry and frustrated.<\/p> <p>  What is the extra cost for the additional 6,000 students?  The Minister mentioned on \"Prime Time\" last night that more than &euro;300 million has been spent.  Is the budget going to be allocated?  Is it coming from the budget that is happening next week?  What are we going to do about those families who children need to get to school?<\/p> <p>  I am dealing with issues where the nearest or next nearest school is at maximum capacity.  If that school is at maximum capacity, what can be done for those children to get them to their P3 school?  What are we saying to parents where there is no existing bus route or service?  There are areas in east Galway where there is no bus service for anyone.  What is going to be done for parents where there is no existing bus route to their P1 or P2 schools?<\/p> <p>  We are working with Bus &Eacute;ireann through the Department of Education.  What can be done here to improve the public bus transport services in those areas?  What else can Bus &Eacute;ireann do because it is not the fault of the bus drivers or the inspectors?  This plan that was put in place is a fantastic initiative and, as the Minister said, there has been an increase, but we have left 6,000 students standing on the side of the road.  Hopefully, there will be solutions in place.  I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#H00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I just want to be clear that this is a measure introduced as a consequence of an unprecedented cost-of-living challenge.  We could have envisaged this cost-of-living challenge or that we would have almost come out of Covid-19 and go into a war in Ukraine, something that we would have hoped we would never have seen.  However, because of that turmoil in the world, there has been a knock-on impact not just for this country but for other countries.  Government has stepped up to the mark in terms of additional funding of more than &euro;2.4 billion.  As part of that, there was an opportunity to do something within the Department of Education that would benefit families in terms of saving them money.  We were given and took that opportunity in late June.  It has resulted in savings for many families.  Originally, the cap was &euro;650 and then &euro;500.  The cap was reduced and 124,000 children and young people are benefitting from it at this point.<\/p> <p>  In terms of concessionary tickets, I hear and know of the individual cases.  I would not want any family to be in that position.  However, in any system there is an eligibility criteria.  Every year there are concessionary tickets and where there is capacity, students get a place on the bus.  Some have been very fortunate to secure that year on year.  However, they also know that year on year that can change.  There can be a new housing development in their area, which means more eligibles come on stream, so there is less availability for concessionary tickets.  More families could move into an area.  That is the issue with concessionary tickets.  We are looking at everything in the round as part of the review, and eligibility criteria is part of that review.<\/p><p>The Senator referenced her own area.  There has been a 23% increase in the availability of tickets in Galway; 33% increase in Roscommon; an increase of one third nationally in concessionary tickets alone made available; and a 21% increase in the overall number of tickets being made available.<\/p><p> I have been clear on the 6,000 who have been impacted as concessionary ticket holders.  I had a budget made available to me and we sorted all of those who were eligible, who now have free tickets.  I recognise that there is a cohort and I recognise their individual circumstances, and I have said I am engaging to see if there is an additional pot of funding that can be used specifically to address concessionary ticket holders who previously had tickets and what capacity is available.  Those discussions are now being held in the context of this budget.  It is the only mechanism open to me.  There are ongoing discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The focus is on addressing the concessionary ticket holders.  They are concessionary tickets because they did not meet the criteria, but I understand that there are individual circumstances, and for that reason I am progressing it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#H00300","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":167,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister very much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#J00200","speaker":"1654"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":168,"content":"<p>I call Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to be followed by Deputy Nolan.

More than one third additional concessionary tickets have been provided this year but a cohort is not being catered for this year because there is no availability on the bus.

For the Minister to put the blame on Bus &Eacute;ireann and to state that she looked at all the options and the company did not raise any issue is deflecting responsibility.  It is the Minister's responsibility.  It was referred to earlier that the Minister inherited the criteria.  We must be mindful that she inherited them from her own Government, from Fianna F&aacute;il, when the former Minister, Mary Coughlan, set out in 2009 and 2010 to destroy school transport in the way that it has been done.  She segregated children into those eligible for concessionary tickets and those eligible for free transport.  The school transport system was working perfectly well until the Minister's own Government got its hands on it.  The Government must take responsibility and there must be accountability for how we have ended up in this situation.  We are forcing children to attend schools that do not teach the subjects of their choice, to go to all-boys or all-girls schools and to attend particularly religious schools.  This is what we have done to school transport.  These are the criteria that we have presented.  This year, families had a reasonable expectation that they would have a seat on the school bus and their work patterns and commitments reflected this.<\/p><p>We talk about the impact on the cost of living, which absolutely was the intention.  However what has happened to these parents is that they now have the additional cost of petrol and diesel, as well as having to give up jobs and to cut their working hours.  How can that be helping them with their cost of living?  Or are they just collateral damage, or the cohort, as we refer to them?<\/p><p> Does the Minister understand the impact on these children who are left on the side of the road?  The Minister was in Mayo last week.  There are children in Strade who were trying to get to Castlebar and who were refused a seat on the bus.  As for the impact on their mental health of not being allowed to get those seats on the bus and indeed on the bus driver who has to refuse them the seat on the bus, the damage that has been done here is absolutely enormous.  As has been said, the Minister needs to apologise to the parents who have paid for a seat on the bus year on year.  The inflexibility around school transport is absolutely atrocious and what we are doing to our children is not acceptable.<\/p><p> Could this have been avoided and what is the Minister is going to do?

Bus &Eacute;ireann has fulfilled its obligations and is working to fill outstanding obligations.  The company's obligation was to cater for those who applied on time and who fulfilled the criteria.  It would not have been appropriate to change the criteria midstream in the midst of an entire review of the school transport system.  It would have thrown up other issues and challenges.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has been charged with providing the transport for those who fulfilled the criteria and who registered on time.  They are doing that.  Some 124,000 children and young people are benefiting from that, which is a 21% increase on where we were last year.

I do not want to rehash the discussions that have gone before.  Ultimately, the recent announcement was motivated by the right reasons and was very much welcome.  The nub of the issue is the children who have been displaced, to whom the Minister alluded.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the Minister's interview last night on \"Prime Time\" in which she stated that the scheme must be driven by need.  That brings me to my first question, which relates to the ongoing review.  I have pleaded privately with the Minister in the past to have a demand-led service, rather than the situation we have inherited with nearest school, second-nearest school, etc.  I hope that will be included in the review.  I know the Minister cannot give us a date for completion of the review but she stated it would shortly issue its recommendations.  Will that be at a date this side of Christmas or the other side of Christmas?  At the very least, will the review's recommendations be brought forward in time for next year's intake?  I would like some clarity on that.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the Minister's comment that she may be able to cater for concessionary ticket holders, subject to the budget next week.  Like all Ministers, the Minister for Education will meet the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance over the coming days, as they prepare the budget.  Can the Minister give the committee some reassurance that this is one of the priority issues she will raise with both Ministers?  If she could give that clarity, it would be welcome as it would give comfort to parents who are still waiting that there may be a solution in the coming weeks.<\/p> <p>  Concerning the scheme, the Minister noted that Bus &Eacute;ireann makes preparations in July.  Is there any way that could be brought back to May or June in future schemes?  Time is of the essence in all of these matters, and school transport takes a lot of planning.  Logistically, it is a tough gig for Bus &Eacute;ireann every year.  If that could be brought forward, that would be a help.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a difficult task regarding the routes and the criteria used.  Sometimes they drop a route and children could move into the area.  Somebody should revise the routes and attendance on the buses.  That should be ongoing, not just something that is instigated in July.

I know in Tara Hill National School in County Wexford a significant number were in receipt of concessionary tickets, but because of the demand this year, that presented a problem.  While it was done entirely for the right reasons, I wonder whether it may have been correct to have charged even a small fee to those who would have been in receipt of automatic tickets this year.

The opportunity to waive the fees presented and that has been welcomed by the 124,000 ticket holders who are benefiting from the measure, notwithstanding some of the discussions.<\/p><p> As regards the review and what it will entail, with regard to spare seat capacity, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates at full capacity.  It is not possible to get inside the minds of parents to find out what decision they will make on a Monday as opposed to a Friday on whether their child will travel on the school bus.  Those who are eligible receive the ticket.  Recommendations on opportunities to do things differently will form part of the review.  As I previously stated to Deputy O'Sullivan, we are looking at completing that review as early as possible.<\/p><p> On the plus side, I can say that the number of children taking up school transport tickets has increased by 21% this year.  Concessionary tickets have increased by one third, which should not be forgotten, and many concessionary ticket holders are being facilitated on school buses.  A cohort of students falls outside the eligibility loop.  I am in discussions in the context of the budget to see what we can do for those individuals and we will continue to work on that between now and next Tuesday.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#N00600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The challenge is that many of those who were in receipt of concessionary tickets, while they certainly welcome the reduction in fees, would have been prepared to continue to pay some sort of fee as it would still have represented a reduction.

It has helped low-income families.  However, the capacity of school transport should have been increased in tandem with the waiver because it has led to a situation where many children are without a bus seat.  I have been informed by parents that some of these children had been using school transport for the previous four or five years.<\/p> <p>  One parents' group based in Emo, County Laois, has serious concerns about the existing issues.  For example, I am told there are eight empty seats on the route from New Inn and Emo to Scoil Cr&iacute;ost R&iacute; and St. Mary's Christian Brothers School in Portlaoise but five children who had concessionary tickets for the past five years are without seats.  I would be grateful if the Minister would look into that issue as I am sure it can be resolved quickly, given that there are eight empty seats.<\/p> <p>  The school bus service from Emo to Mountmellick Community School needs to be re-established.  No service has operated since 2016 and it is my understanding that 19 children are eligible under the existing Bus &Eacute;ireann scheme.  This service must be urgently reinstated.  We can resolve lots of issues that went wrong with school transport this year.  We have problems with it every year.  I raised these issues with previous Ministers for Education.  To be fair, the Minister has tried to alleviate hardship on families by bringing in the waiver.  Again, however, capacity is the real problem, as it has been for a number of years.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister would look into the two issues in Laois that I highlighted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#O00400","speaker":"1592"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I acknowledge that Deputy Nolan has a particular understanding of the issues here.  Capacity has been increased, specifically for those who are eligible on the basis that they meet the criteria.  There has been a 21% increase in the number of tickets issued.  In the Deputy's area, County Laois, the figure has increased by 31%.  In every county we are seeing an increase in the number of children receiving tickets.  I do not for a minute wish to take away from the cases raised by the Deputy, including that of five children in need of concessionary tickets in a particular area.<\/p> <p>  As regards empty seats, places are allocated on the basis of eligibility.  We can look at this further.  As I stated, it is not easy to get inside the minds of families to determine why a child may travel on one particular day and not travel on another, or may not travel for the first few weeks of school.  Parents may bring a child to school until he or she settles in and the child may travel on the bus after that.  It is difficult to ascertain but we can follow up on the issue.  Tickets are allocated on the basis of who is eligible to have a seat on the bus.  Circumstances may vary from day to day and that may explain why a child does not travel on one particular day but may travel on another day.<\/p> <p>  In response to the question about an additional route, the review is examining eligibility and the various criteria and there is an opportunity for those matters to be considered.  I will revert to the Deputy on ensuring there is full capacity and that it is being met on the bus service to which she referred.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#P00100","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":228,"content":"<p>In the limited time I have, I would like to raise a few issues.  The budget is only one week away.  Despite the challenges we have with school transport this year, this measure was born out of goodwill and a wish to ease the financial burden for parents as children return to school.  It would be wonderful if we could implement it again next year and fix the teething problems we have experienced.  In every town, village and city in the country, be it in Tralee or in my neck of the woods in County Clare, people can get from one end to the other with relative ease in the months of July and August because school traffic and the mile-long queues of parents dropping off their children are absent.  Earlier today, the transport committee discussed the western rail corridor, which could take ten years to develop.  Metro north could take 15 years to develop.  All of these important but rather extravagant projects will take an inordinate amount of time to complete.  In relative terms, it does not take as much time, effort or money to put a bus carrying 50 children on the road and bring it up the narrow roads to Parteen National School or any other school in the country.  That takes many cars off the road and relieves the financial pressure on parents, on a par with childcare costs.  Parents have to factor into their daily routine not only childcare costs but also school pick-up and collection.  I ask that the Minister champion at Cabinet level rolling out this measure more extensively next year.  Does she have any views on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#P00500","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":229,"content":"<p>I absolutely see the benefit of the school transport scheme.  I referred to this earlier and nobody knows it better than I do given the constituency I come from.  It is an integral part of the system.  I also know there are opportunities to do things differently.  That is the reason I instigated the review of the entire scheme.  The Deputy is correct that this measure is an enormous addition for families who are benefiting from it on a waived-fee basis.  It addresses climate action and eases the burden for families as regards pick-up times.  Whether we have the opportunity to do it next year will be a financial and budgetary consideration.  Irrespective of some of the challenges we face this year, and even despite them, the system has worked well for 124,000 children in mainstream education.  We are working through the challenges for those in need of concessionary tickets.  Everything will be taken into consideration but it will be a budgetary decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#P00600","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":230,"content":"<p>Some European countries have made their entire public transport system free in response to climate change.

The Minister, Deputy Ryan, will be looking for certain projects.  However, this is far more urgent.  Yes, there are issues with drivers and with concessionary and other tickets, but lessons can be learned from this summer.  While we work through these current problems, we should be looking at rolling this out again in the summer of 2023.<\/p><p> Quite a number of Ukrainian children are in County Clare at the moment.  In fact, outside of Dublin, we have the largest Ukrainian population in the country.  On census night, 2% of the Clare population was Ukrainian.  These children have been welcomed into communities, particularly in north and west Clare, which are very rural communities.  They have been placed in hotels where there happens to be a large capacity of rooms but not necessarily the infrastructure to support them thereafter.  School buses have become a major issue.  We have dealt with most of the primary and secondary school queries in Clare at the moment with Ms Stephanie Ryan in the regional office of Bus &Eacute;ireann, who has been fantastic.  The major outlying issue has been getting Ukrainian students from their accommodation centres to schools.  It has become a bane for school principals.  They have all been in contact.  The Minister might have particular oversight of that.  I know she Minister cannot drill down in every single case, but where large clusters of students are placed, the Minister needs to look at bus accommodation for those students.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#P00700","speaker":"1519","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":232,"content":"<p>That is what is being done.

I also have some questions myself.  The school transport issue has dominated the headlines both locally and nationally for the month of August and into September.  Every town's secondary school has been greatly affected and the students thereby.  It is definitely not an isolated incident.  It has left both pupils and especially parents with huge upset and frustration and has put stress on a large number of families.  I felt sorry for students starting secondary school.  There is a large amount of anecdotal evidence but I have some real evidence.  Following from Senator Malcolm Byrne and perhaps it is a Wexford thing but if something is given for free, it is like finding something in a lucky bag and everyone will be looking for it for free and that is the way that it is.  It was a huge mistake not to have some sort of nominal fee charged.  I know it was a cost-of-living measure but the Minister has put a huge amount of financial stress on other families.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talks about climate change but I think it has put additional traffic on the road rather than taking traffic off the road due to parents driving ten, 15 or 20 km round trips every day to bring their children to school where those children had concessionary passes.  I have evidence of four pupils who got bus tickets and who have no intention of ever using them.  One is in fifth year, another in third year, another in second year and one went into first year.  Both parents in each case live in the town.  That is happening throughout the country. Because it was free, the parents thought it would be great have the tickets in case they needed them some day.  Someday will never come.  Their parents have brought them to school for the past five years and will continue to bring them to school.  They have blocked off concessionary tickets on the route.<\/p><p> On one route in County Wexford, the bus driver lets everybody on the bus.

There has been an increase in school demands in Ardara, County Donegal, where I live, obviously as the numbers are growing due to the numbers of Ukrainian refugees in the local communities.  The demand is growing in rural Ireland in particular with regard to rooms and buses.  What extra services is the Department putting in place for villages such as Ardara and Glenties to make sure that children are able to get on the bus and that the bus facilitates all children, including Ukrainian refugees?  Yesterday the T&aacute;naiste said that there needed to be more buses put in place.

Certainly, the public deserve a great deal better in that regard.  It is up to us as public representatives to hold people to account in this area.<\/p> <p>  School transport provision is specifically designed around eligible pupils.  Those outside the eligibility criteria - and I welcome the cost-of-living measures in providing free transport and the waiver - have certainly been forgotten in this conversation.  The message being put out is that it is not a real problem but it absolutely is.  We need to recognise the families who bought tickets in previous years.  The reality now is that for some families, their children attend their second school.  However, for instance, as has been mentioned previously, Straide and Ballyvary, outside Castlebar, are not their third, fourth or fifth closest school; they are their second.  They live within the distance limits, have paid for and held tickets previously and have not received them this year.  <\/p> <p>  I will certainly give one instance, as explained to me by one constituent, of the overwhelming effect the policy change has caused her family, where additional childcare is now required in the morning to take her second-level children to school costing &euro;100 a week, which will cost more than &euro;4,000 per annum.  The additional fuel costs are estimated at an additional &euro;70 per week.

I have to say there should be a little bit of humility.<\/p><p>We have had examples from everybody but one example regarding concessionary tickets is in Knocknahur, County Sligo.  The Healy family have had concessionary tickets for 16 years as the children were being raised.  They paid for them but were told they were too late.  They cannot ring their employer and say &quot;No&quot;.  Those people are equal citizens, by the way.  They all have votes in Kerry as well as in Sligo-Leitrim.<\/p><p>There is a need for a basic acknowledgement from Government that while it was set up with the best will in the world to help families and while 124,000 are being helped, as the Minister tells us <i>ad nauseam<\/i>, 6,000 have been discommoded, and whether it was the fault of the Minister, an official or Bus &Eacute;ireann, that failure needs to be acknowledged.  We do not need to be told constantly how great things are, because we are in the help business in politics, as the Minister knows.  We are not here to slap each other on the back.  We are here to identify problems and seek solutions.  I call on the Minister to acknowledge the mistake and to ensure, in the interests of everybody, that those 6,000 people are looked after from a transport perspective in the budget next week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#V00300","speaker":"1606"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":317,"content":"<p>If I could reply briefly, we must be clear.

I totally appreciate that, but there are a lot of students passing their local primary or secondary school to go to another school.  What I am asking for today, and no doubt it will be incorporated into the review, is to ensure that the building unit has a very proactive role in that review, because I believe that figure of &euro;150 million on special needs is going to increase.  The way around that would be to be more focused on using money to build extra additional ASD classes in local schools, where young people could go to school with their brothers and sisters on the same bus.  There is a lot of empty space and empty capacity on many of these buses.  The sad thing for a lot of people today, for the 6,000 figure mentioned and the ten students in my own county of Donegal I mentioned as well, is that they were entitled to tickets in the past, but they are not being afforded that opportunity.  Additional buses will be needed.  I wish the Minister well with the negotiation with the Minister, Deputy McGrath.  I had a history of very tense communication between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when it came to bus transportation.  They talk about long-term sustainability, but at the end of the day, if we are going to get more cars off the road and be more green-focused in relation to buses and electric buses and so on, bus transportation is going to be part of that sustainable future.

I specifically want to raise the situation of Whitegate in County Clare.  It is the last village in County Clare before reaching the Galway border, in the east of the county, on the Shannon.  The nearest secondary school is in Scariff.  According to some of the Department's calculations, the nearest secondary school is in Woodford, in the very south-east of County Galway.  People typically do not go to Woodford secondary school from Whitegate in great numbers because Scariff is in County Clare and Scariff, like Whitegate, is a hurling area and hurling is quite important.  The main point is Whitegate and Scariff are in County Clare.  That vast majority from the national school in Whitegate go on to Scariff secondary school.  If you put these locations into Google Maps, you will see that Scariff is the nearest and fastest place to get to.  You can get to Woodford by a back road through Derrygoolin.  I would highly recommend that the Minister go to Derrygoolin if she is interested in woodcock shooting or snipe shooting; other than that, there is nothing there.  It is essentially a forest track that will take you to Woodford.  You need a four-wheel drive and certainly would not be driving a school bus there.  I have raised this issue with the Minister before in the context of Broadford students being told that the nearest school was across \"the gap\", as it is called, which you certainly would not drive on in any type of vehicle at certain times of the year.  The Minister agreed to look into it and she did, in fairness.  I want the Minister to look into the position of Whitegate and the school bus.<\/p><p>Ireland is full of roads because of British crown forces, which we are viewing differently as time moves on.  They built loads of roads in Ireland.  We have more roads in Ireland than any other country in western Europe for a variety of military as well as socioeconomic reasons.  Many of those roads are not kept, and it would not be possible to keep all the roads and boreens across Slieve Aughty.  Many of them have become forest tracks, so the idea that school buses would be taking those morning and evening or that children would be penalised because British forces built a road because they wanted to subdue a certain group of people at a particular time is an absolute nonsense.  There are roads that Google would recommend people use and that are used, and there are roads that, while you could bring your cattle along them or use them if you wanted to go shooting snipe or woodcock, nobody is driving regularly.  They are certainly not fit for school buses.  The Minister's Department needs to get real about that.  It is almost like a desperate attempt to find a road somewhere - anywhere - that can take people.  Therefore, I want the Minister not only to look at the issue of Whitegate but also at the broader issue of the identification of these roads, which may be faster in theory but might in fact take an extra half an hour.  I do not know if the Minister wishes to reply or if she can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ESJ2022092100002#X01000","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  On the specific incidence he raises, I can certainly take a look at it but I cannot give any definitive answer on it.  In terms of the broader scope around routes and roads, the criteria are clear about nearest and next nearest, but certainly all of that features very much in and is part of the entire review.  I take the point the Deputy is making in terms of back roads as opposed to main roads.  Everything can feed into this review and we can see where we are going forward.  Many of the issues he raises have been raised by Deputy Crowe and Senator Dooley.  I am conscious of the significant difference and challenge for rural transport, and nobody knows that better than the Deputy himself.  The purpose of the review is to ensure we have a system in place in order that we do all we can to ensure the maximum number of children and young people avail of a transport system, not just from an economic point of view but also from a climate action and accessibility point of view.  There is a strong body of work under way, recognising there are new opportunities to do things differently.  That review will be completed in a short while and we will take it from there.

We all have areas we can mention, like Annagassan, which is, unfortunately, almost equidistant between the school in Dunleer, the school in Ardee, and Dundalk.  This has created an anomaly where people who usually got concessionary tickets now have not.  It is a major issue.  We are talking about 20 and possibly even 30 families, because there are probably a number of them who are already making difficult logistical fixes.  Either way, we need that dealt with as soon as possible.<\/p> <p>  We are all glad this is moving in the right direction, and whatever has been has been.  Are we talking about looking at those 6,000 concessionary tickets, and if that is the case, how much and what are the obstacles to delivering for them?<\/p><p>I am somewhat worried about the position with regard to those who got concessionaries before.

As she knows, some children, particularly in the Athlone and Roscommon areas, did not have a school place until July of this year.  Eventually they got offered a school place, but now they have no school transport.  I know of a family who are travelling 120 km a day to bring their son outside of the county to and from an autism unit.  They have another child with a disability who is travelling 20 km in the opposite direction.  They are in crisis at the moment.  A number of autistic children still have not got a school transport service.  They have been issued with a bus ticket, but they have no bus service.  These children have been neglected by the Department.

I appreciate that and absolutely understand the importance of it.

It is a bit intimidating to be in a room full of men so I thank Senator Keogan for being here this morning.  I am deeply honoured to sit in front of the members today to provide an update on the status of North Macedonia's European integration and to also have the opportunity to brief each other, because I believe this should be a two-way street, and to contribute to the wider strategic discussion on EU enlargement.  Let me first express my gratitude for the continual interest and strong support of the Irish Parliament for EU enlargement.  Ireland has always been a firm supporter of EU enlargement, not only in words but in deeds.<\/p> <p>  This meeting comes at the start of a brand new chapter for my country.  Two months ago, on 19 July, the first Intergovernmental Conference with the EU took place.  This was the opening phase of the accession negotiations with the EU and it provided long-sought recognition for the reforms the country has undertaken in the past years.  Only last Friday, on 15 September, we saw the actual start of the screening process whereby EU experts have begun to examine EU laws and policies under Chapter 1, which concerns the fundamentals.  This will not just be a technical exercise but one with a concrete impact on improving the quality of life of citizens.<\/p> <p>  My country has transformed many years of disappointments, obstacles and blockades into yet another opportunity to enable us to offer arguments, to offer persistence and to offer trust in good neighbourly relations, thus coming to a solution facilitating the start of the EU accession negotiations.  This long-awaited chapter in our integration process, after 17 long years of being a candidate country and facing many challenges along the way, is an achievement that the citizens have long been deserving of.  We have proven to be a European country.  We have shown that we can build compromise and we do not play the zero-sum game.  We are a multi-ethnic society, a model of consensual democracy, and we have a lot to share and to offer to the EU&rsquo;s accommodating of diversity.<\/p><p>We strongly believe that the EU integration process will be an additional drive that will mobilise all stakeholders in the country.  Working together, we are committed to our reform dossier.  The enlargement has always been a substantive and cohesive factor in the country and an element of our society.  Our place is in the EU.  We have said many times that we are a reliable partner to the EU and its member states.  We will continue to function in that way.  Our aim is to be a positive example of the fastest EU integration, just as we had the fastest integration as a member country of NATO.  In this respect, the Government made a strong commitment to advance on EU reforms, especially in the areas of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and organised crime, etc.  On this road, we know we can count on the support of our Irish friends.<\/p><p> I will refer to two other elements which speak to our determination and commitment to the EU agenda.  The first is the alignment with the EU's common foreign and security policy, CFSP.  We are 100% aligned with the CFSP.  We have shown that we can be a reliable and trusted partner in this troubled geopolitical context.  We also have 100% compliance with the restrictive measures.  This comes with a price.  It has a socioeconomic impact, notably on energy.  It is important for the EU to show it can involve the western Balkans and other partners when taking actions to mitigate the consequences of the war in Ukraine.  I wish also to mention our growing regional co-operation, which has been significantly increased in recent years with our conciliatory approach to solving bilateral issues.  We are taking a leading position in the context of the growing regional co-operation and would like to serve as a role model in contributing to strengthening regional stability.  Our strong position is that regional initiatives should be complementary and should not interfere with the future EU negotiation processes.  They should go together.  It should be an inclusive process for all the counties in the region.<\/p><p> I hope that Ireland will remain on our side along the way, as it has been so far.  On his most recent visit to Skopje on 4 July, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, voiced Ireland's strong support and, most important, its deep understanding of the importance of preserving national identity and language while integrating into the EU.  Ireland is best placed to understand and advocate for our position.  EU membership brings opportunities to a country, be they economic, political or otherwise.  We intend to follow that example and prove this premise true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092100002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":400,"content":"<p>I thank Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski for her presentation and her presence.

It is one thing for the Government to say it but an opinion poll released by European Movement Ireland yesterday showed massive public support for the enlargement of the European Union to include the accession of countries such as North Macedonia.  Ireland has been consistent in wanting a growing European Union.  Just because we have lost one member state does not mean we cannot bring in at least three if not a half a dozen others in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski mentioned the assimilation of North Macedonia into the structures of NATO.  Will she detail what that process involved and the level of engagement North Macedonia has with NATO?

The invasion of a sovereign and peaceful country cannot be justified by any means.  We have since the beginning expressed our full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.  We stand by Ukraine and its internationally recognised borders.  We commend its brave defence, which is protecting freedom and sovereignty.  The great courage Ukrainians have shown is inspiring.  They are demonstrating that freedom and democracy are the most powerful weapons any country can have in its defence.  We have since the beginning fully aligned, as I said in my opening remarks, to the EU's CFSP.  We have aligned ourselves to the substantial package of sanctions against Russia.  In March and April, we expelled 11 Russian diplomats from North Macedonia because there were clear signs of malign Russian activity.  We have expressed support to Ukraine in several ways.  We have sent military equipment, about which I will understandably not go into detail here.  We have opened our doors to Ukrainian refugees.  Approximately 1,200 refugees are currently housed in my country.  This answer links to the question the Deputy asked about NATO.  The NATO agenda in the past few months and the latest extraordinary meetings have once again proved that unity, solidarity and the resolute firmness of our allies and partners in dealing with the escalating crisis in Ukraine, and the political and practical support supplied to Ukraine, are stronger and more important when there are more member states around the table, including from the still vulnerable western Balkans region.  We have fully engaged with all the meetings and preparatory works at NATO.  As a NATO member, we have expressed our firm commitment to Ukraine and actively participated in creating the NATO common strategy with regard to Russian aggression in Ukraine.  We also actively engaged in the adoption of the new strategic concept of NATO during the most recent summit in Madrid where, among other points, unequivocal support and determination were expressed to Ukraine and Russia was condemned as the most significant and direct threat not only to the security of Ukraine but also in a larger and broader context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092100002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I thank Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski for being here.<\/p><p>She should not let the men in here intimidate her in any way because we certainly are not intimidated by them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092100002#B00400","speaker":"1664","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":404,"content":"<p>Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski will find out in a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092100002#C00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":405,"content":"<p>During the French Presidency of the EU Council, President Macron made proposals for the commencement of the accession negotiations that included conditions requiring both North Macedonia and Bulgaria to make concessions on their disputes.

The Senator is correct.  There is, indeed, an overall perception in the country that the country has paid a very high price for the start of the accession negotiations.  It is a fact that the Opposition does not support the French-brokered deal with Bulgaria that the Government has accepted and that has now been implemented in order to start the accession negotiations and have the first intergovernmental conference.  It is true that this is creating a difficult political situation in the country but let me assure the Senator that my country's leadership has demonstrated great courage and great vision for the European future of the country despite the strong opposition from the political parties in the Opposition.<\/p> <p>  We had a deepened dialogue with Bulgaria led by the two foreign ministries.  At the end, we believe that we have found an amicable solution which makes both sides equally satisfied and equally dissatisfied.  The commitment that the Government has undertaken is to amend the constitution and include the Bulgarians as one of the founding peoples of the country along with Montenegrins and Croatians.  So far, we have the Turks, the Albanians, the Vlachs and the Roma.  We expect that all political actors and political parties, especially members of the parliament, should work together to advance any EU reforms because the parliament has and will have the key role in the accession process.  Political parties have to work together.  It requires a two thirds majority to change the constitution in the parliament which, for now, is lacking but I am convinced that the Government will spare no efforts in communicating the benefits of the EU integration process and to convince the public that the negotiating framework is in line with our national interests because the national identity is preserved, the Macedonian language is preserved and history has been kept out of the negotiating process.  It will need to have a bottom-up approach to explain properly, to persuade the citizens and to gradually change their minds and their mindsets.  It will be a battle of hearts and minds.  All the members of the parliament and the political parties have to be up to their task and see the main interests of the country, which is the EU accession.<\/p> <p>  If I may say so on a personal level, the EU should double its presence in the country with concrete programmes with visible tangible results, for example, in infrastructure in connectivity, that will speak of the advantages to showcase that there are tangible deliverables of this accession process in order that we can create a positive momentum in our society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2022092100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":407,"content":"<p>I note North Macedonia has got &euro;610 million since it applied in 2008.

We have had political parties that have come full circle and have now seen the light but that opposed every referendum we have had in this country in terms of EU treaties.

We have been a candidate country for 17 long years owing to various reasons, the first of which was Greece and the issue of our name, and then Bulgaria and the question of identity and language.  In those 17 years, we have not just waited in the lobby without doing anything.  We have been preparing ourselves.

We are as ready as Serbia and Montenegro, which have already been negotiating with the EU for a few years.  The screening process consists of two phases.  The first is the explanatory session, which is very technical EU wording that I do not grasp very well.  The second is the bilateral session, in which each country is invited to present where it stands chapter by chapter.  At the end of this, the Commission will evaluate our readiness and present an assessment of the country's degree of preparedness.  It will then start opening cluster by cluster.  Our goal is to move quickly through those chapters and clusters and implement the reforms as well as the strong commitment that our Government has made.<br\/><br\/>The timeline is difficult to predict, but we would like to join the package with Serbia and Montenegro and join the EU by 2030, if possible.

It is also good for promoting regional stability.  Unanimity is required at the European Council to bring in a new member state.  That has obviously been one of North Macedonia's problems, given the objections from Bulgaria and Greece.  North Macedonia has dealt with the Bulgarian issues.  Is the issue with Greece large resolved now that the country has been renamed?  Is that issue off the table and are the Greeks on board, so to speak, insofar as they can be?<\/p> <p>  During the French Presidency, there was a suggestion by President Macron of some sort of two-speed Europe in terms of enlargement, with some sort of lesser form of membership.

Since February, there has understandably been a focus on the three applicant states, one of which is under direct assault.  The ambassador of another applicant state is present with us.  There was a concern in some applicant states that considered themselves to be much further advanced that they would somehow be eclipsed by the focus on the applications of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova.  I would be interested in hearing Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski's perspective on that.  Was there a fear that a new focus would delay the advance in the accession route of countries such as her own?  What was the official view in North Macedonia?<\/p> <p>  We have a particular understanding of some of the questions that North Macedonia had to address in terms of almost defining nationality, particularly with neighbours who were assertive of their own nationality and did not want any exclusion of their minority populations, including language and name.

On 24 February, a new era and a new chapter in geopolitics began.  If Russia's aggression against Ukraine has not brought all of us together with a common understanding of the intrinsic value of EU enlargement, including the western Balkans, Georgia and Moldova, as was the case back in the 1990s with the enlargement to include central European countries, then there is nothing in the future of a greater magnitude to achieve this.  We warmly welcomed the EU candidate status for Ukraine and Moldova, as well as the European perspective for Georgia.  It is an important message of solidarity and a historic step for the recognition of the European future of these countries.  As I said, we welcome this decision.  We do not see it as a threat to the western Balkans in general.  It is positive news.  The success of one country is a success for all countries.  If Serbia and Montenegro are progressing towards the EU, that is a good sign for us that we will progress.  It is motivation for us, Moldova and Ukraine too.<\/p> <p>  In response to the second question, as I said at the beginning, political parties, especially the opposition, should be up to their tasks, as should members of parliament.  They should concentrate on what is in the interests of the country, not on what is in the interests of the political party until the next elections.  I do not agree with the perception that the country has paid a high price to start the accession negotiations.

It is fair to say the conversation about accession in recent years was not really serious.  The war in Ukraine has changed the geopolitics and people are looking at accession differently.

The committee is aware of the many changes to our banking sector in recent years, driven by factors including advances in technology and changing consumer demand.  We have also seen the exit of two key banks from the sector in Ireland, which has had and will continue to have very wide-reaching consequences.  The changes under way in the banking sector are a reflection of the wider challenges the sector is facing across the world.  It is because of these national and global developments that my Department is undertaking a broad-ranging review of retail banking in our country to address how the sector can be best positioned to meet current and future needs.  I look forward to completing this work later in the year.<\/p> <p>  In the midst of this change, it is crucial that we recognise the interest of citizens and their priorities as we make policy.  With this in mind, the Government intends to further enhance the Central Bank's existing powers through provisions to be introduced in the Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022.  The centrepiece of this new legislation, in accordance with a commitment in the programme for Government, is the senior executive accountability regime, SEAR, which seeks to improve the culture of the financial sector and restore public trust in it.  It is apparent that as the sector undergoes significant change, the credit union sector has the potential to play a more significant role in the provision of financial services to households and businesses.  That is why my Department has conducted a policy review of the credit union sector and is developing legislation to support credit unions further.<\/p> <p>  We are doing this in awareness of the significant change that is taking place in terms of digital technology and access to cash.  We have seen a shift in the way consumers and businesses are using banking services and making payments.  While Ireland has historically been a relatively cash-intensive economy, significant changes have occurred, with a rapid increase in the move towards more digital technologies and new ways of banking.  New players have entered the financial services sector and are offering new and innovative services to consumers.  The Covid-19 pandemic has acted as a catalyst for this move towards digital payments. <\/p> <p>  By the end of the year, the European Commission will have published legislation making instant payments mandatory for participants within the EU.  This means Irish consumers will soon be able to benefit from instant payments between individuals and companies.  Notwithstanding the significant increase in the take-up of electronic payments, cash remains a vital part of the Irish banking system.  Banks have a key role in the maintenance of the flow of cash through the economy and in ensuring appropriate access to retail banking services for all in society, including the vulnerable.  In this context, I note the significant public reaction to AIB's announcement in July regarding branch changes.  I welcomed the bank's decision at that time not to proceed with the proposed changes to customer services in certain branches.<\/p> <p>  In February 2021, NatWest began the process of winding down its Ulster Bank business in the Republic of Ireland.  Shortly after, on 16 April, KBC Bank announced its withdrawal from the Irish market.  All of this will be done in accordance with Irish legislation, including the Central Bank's codes of conduct.  The Central Bank has clear requirements that apply when firms cease operations or transfer operations to another entity.  Last week, it published an update showing an encouraging downward trend of accounts in the withdrawing banks.  The banking sector must continue to ensure adequate resources and training.  My officials and the Central Bank are engaging with all stakeholders to ensure they receive the best possible customer experience.  Customer protection is at the forefront of our engagement and consumers must be certain the entity they are banking with is trustworthy, efficient and accountable.<\/p> <p>  This leads me to the SEAR.  The Central Bank (Individual Accountability Framework) Bill 2022 was published on 28 July this year and will progress in the coming months.  It will drive greater accountability in the financial sector and raise the standards of expected behaviour for individuals and firms to achieve better outcomes for consumers and improve the sustainability of the financial system.  I believe it will drive positive change in the culture of the financial services industry, including enhanced accountability, and provide for clearer sanctions against individuals who fail in their role.<\/p><p>The Central Bank will hold public consultations on the implementation of the Bill.<\/p><p> As I mentioned at the start, last November my Department began a review of the retail banking sector.  Stakeholders were invited to make submissions and we launched a public consultation on 16 May at the retail banking review dialogue.  We have now received 90 submissions and I expect to receive the report of the retail banking review in November.  Part of our consideration refers to the credit union movement.  It is a cornerstone of community banking and provides a wide range of services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and my Department have carried out extensive stakeholder engagement and we have received input from a wide range of stakeholders to develop a comprehensive set of policy proposals.  The Government announced and approved these proposals in July and drafting of the Bill is under way.  Department officials are engaging with the sector through the quarterly stakeholder round table and with the Credit Union Advisory Committee.<\/p><p> I turn to the State&rsquo;s role in the Irish banking sector.  It is important to remember that the aim is to strike a balance between intervention and allowing the sector to operate with commercial independence, such that competition and innovation are not stunted.  The Bank of Ireland share trading plan has continued in recent months and I expect to be able to announce shortly that the State&rsquo;s directed shareholding has reduced to zero.  This will be an important milestone in delivering on the Government&rsquo;s policy of returning the banks to private ownership.  Proceeds generated from the share trading plan since its launch will be well over &euro;800 million.  In June of this year the State sold a 5% stake in AIB, which reduced our shareholding to 63.5% while generating &euro;305 million for the Exchequer.  Prior to this transaction, a share trading plan was in operation which provided for a low-key and low-cost resumption of share sales after a gap of more than four years.  It will resume operating at the end of this month and the Department of Finance will continue to monitor markets for future opportunities to sell down more of our shareholding through larger transactions.  In the past year we have made great progress in strengthening the position of Permanent TSB in the market and in protecting citizens&rsquo; investment in the bank.  Permanent TSB now has greater scale and has a more important role than ever in providing meaningful competition in Ireland.  Although Permanent TSB will primarily fund the transaction from internal resources, the bank is expected to issue shares to NatWest also.  As a result, NatWest will hold 16.66% of the issued share capital of Permanent TSB while the State&rsquo;s shareholding in Permanent TSB will reduce from 74.9% to 62.4%.  However, we will then have a smaller stake in a much larger and more attractive bank in the years ahead.  I look forward to seeing Permanent TSB playing its role as a supporter of growth and jobs in Ireland.<\/p><p> The banking sector in Ireland is going through considerable change.  My officials and I are working to ensure that amid this change consumers are fully protected and the banking sector, which is integral to the economy and to society, is strengthened for the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#A00300","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":443,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his lengthy introduction.  I appreciate that this is a particularly busy week for him and it is always appreciated when he has the opportunity to engage with the committee.  There is one area of the banking sector I would like to pick up on that the Minister did not quite go into in his remarks.  It came up in quite a bit of detail last week during our engagements with the three banks when Deputy Barry asked a number of questions on mortgages and interest rates.  We all know that compared with its EU counterparts, Ireland has traditionally had much higher interest rates on mortgages in recent years.  While it is welcome that these rates have come down in recent years, I was wondering if the Minister could elaborate, either in his position as Minister for Finance or as president of the Eurogroup, on what impact he would expect the recent rise and surge in inflation, particularly at a European level, to have on this.  Are we looking at a convergence between Irish and EU rates in the near future?  What other actions might need to be taken in this regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00200","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  As he has acknowledged, a significant degree of change is under way with regard to interest rate policy in the future.  The European Central Bank, ECB, through its president and the chief economist, has indicated the kind of action it will consider in the future.  If inflation in Ireland becomes a core part of our economy for years to come, it will make us even poorer for longer.  I accept that a change in interest rates can bring difficulty for those who are borrowing and who want to borrow in the future, but any changes that are made are made with the aim of avoiding inflation and ensuring we are not poorer for longer.<\/p> <p>  On where we stand in Ireland, we have seen considerable change in interest rates over many years.  In 2014 we started off with an average level of fixed interest rates for new lending of 4.1% and in July of this year it moved to 2.5%.  A key feature that has developed alongside this is that over 80% - in July the figure reached 88% - of new mortgages being issued are fixed-rate mortgages.  That is one of the reasons we have seen a decline in the interest rate in new mortgages, which has moved from 4% in 2014 to 2.6% in July of this year.  We are now at a point where the gap between the Irish rate for new borrowing and the average of the eurozone is 0.5%, which is a significant decrease on where we have been for so long.  I would expect to see change in the years to come.  The Deputy knows what the powers of the Central Bank are when it comes to variable-rate mortgage holders as changes are made to their rates of interest.  We have also strengthened consumer protection for those consumers who require certain issues to be considered.  We are seeing a narrowing between ourselves and the rest of the eurozone, but we are at a moment of change in these things and the public indications are that just as inflation is staying higher for longer, banks will take that into account in the interest rate decisions they make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00300","speaker":"1558"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>When the Minister says \"we are at a moment of change\", that leads into my next question and they are all related.  No different from any of us as Deputies with constituencies, people continuously contacted my office throughout the summer because they are worried about the pricing on their borrowings - a mortgage, a car loan or anything else - especially in the context of wider concerns about rising energy costs and the entire cost-of-living area.  When we engage with the banks and when individuals have engaged with banks, one issue that has come up is the high rate of capital levels that Irish banks have been required to maintain in recent years, compared with European counterparts.  Is that an area where we might also be at a point of change?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00400","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":446,"content":"<p>This is a decision that is made by central banks and regulators.  The Central Bank of Ireland decides how much capital our banks hold and I will not give an indication on how an independent regulatory decision could be made.  I know Deputy Richmond will understand why that is the case and why I have to take that course of comment.  I am aware of all the commentary that has taken place on the difference between capital levels for Irish banks, the amount and kind of capital they are required to hold and how that stacks up versus other countries.  That then has an impact on the interest rates that are made available to new borrowers.  I am aware of all of that but I would make two points alongside it.  First, if we ever needed a reminder of the importance of banks being well capitalised and being resilient, it was when we got hit by a pandemic in Ireland.<\/p><p>Our financial sector here did not become an amplifier of the economic shock that was the closure of our economy for prolonged periods.  That demonstrated the value of our banking sector having a high degree of capital because that was one of the reasons, alongside the economic support the Government made available, that the financial sector avoided becoming part of the problem.<\/p><p> The second reason is that the high level of capital our banks have is directly driven by the scale of the banking crisis we endured in Ireland for a number of years.  That period is part of the overall period which the regulators use to calculate the level of capital banks should hold now.  This is an illustration of the many costs and consequences of our banking system running into such extraordinary difficulty and the costs that were borne from that.  It reminds me of the need never to get to that point again.  Of course, as that crisis recedes into the rearview mirror, its role in influencing the level of capital that our banks must hold will also recede.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2022092100002#B00500","speaker":"1558","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>The Minister alluded to the area of bank departures, particularly when it comes to both Ulster Bank and KBC Bank Ireland.

Is the Minister satisfied that the banks and also the utility companies are doing enough to encourage and facilitate switching to make sure there is not a cliff edge for customers of those banks, particularly elderly customers who perhaps are not as savvy with digital banking?

In Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank, in the first eight months of this year, we have now seen more than 600,000 new accounts being opened.  All that being said, however, there is no reason to derive early satisfaction regarding this huge consumer project being complete.  We have a long way to go in that regard, and there are many different consumer issues we need to monitor.<\/p> <p>  What are we going to do about it through our regulator and what are the banks doing in that regard?  There are a number of different things on the way.  First, as the committee will be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland is engaging regularly with the five banks involved in this and is publishing information about what is happening with bank changes and account changes.  Second, a really big advertising campaign is under way.  I, for one, cannot turn on the radio now without hearing this.  It is much needed and it is clear.  Third, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, is now engaging directly with utility providers with regard to making this as clean, clear and simple as possible.  At the same time, the regulator is engaged with the three remaining banks to ensure the right levels of staff and resources are in place to be able to open up the new accounts that will be needed for those who currently bank with KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank.<\/p> <p>  There are, therefore, some signs of progress.  It is far too early to be able to say that we are there on it yet.

I say that not to score points because this affects all of us.

We can see from details regarding banking fraud that two out of three people in this State are reporting that they have been the subject of an attempted fraud.  We know that different types of fraud that are taking place are also increasing.  There has been an 80% increase in the number of fraudulent scams with people being conned out of &euro;15.6 million.  We have information about unauthorised payment fraud rising by 20% in the last year to more than &euro;41.5 million.  Some 2,375 individuals were the subject of a form of fraud known as authorised push payments where they were tricked into making credit transfers to accounts controlled by fraudsters up to the value of &euro;9.2 million.

Before I do, I want to remind everyone of what was said by the Central Bank in its headings regarding its key findings.  It said that AIB:<\/p> <blockquote> \tFailed to consider the entitlements of customers when it withdrew the tracker mortgage product ...<br \/><br \/>Breached customers' mortgage contracts, delayed in rectifying the breach, and failed to take immediate and conclusive action to determine for these customers the financial implications of its wrongdoing ...<br \/><br \/>Wrongfully excluded customers' mortgage accounts ...<br \/><br \/>Failed to handle customer complaints in a fair and consistent manner ...<br \/><br \/>Failed to properly manage its mortgage services to customers, resulting in breaches of customers' consumer protection rights [etc.] ... [and]<br \/><br \/>Failed to properly implement the ... Stop the Harm principles. <\/blockquote> <p>That is what the Central Bank said about the tracker mortgage issue and the fine it was imposing on AIB.  It failed its customers.  The Central Bank said that these &quot;failings caused unacceptable harm and loss ... over the course of nearly 18 years&quot; and that AIB's actions had &quot;devastating consequences for its customers&quot;.  If that was said about another company, there would probably be a clear-out of the directors.  Certainly, whoever was left would ask that senior managers would consider their positions at least.  None of that happened.  There were 57 regulatory breaches.  They were fined &euro;119 million but they got a discount of 30%.  I do not know anyone who gets a discount like that when they have done so much damage.  A number of houses were repossessed and a number of families were destroyed - the litany of errors goes on and on.<\/p><p>Now we are asking that same bank with that record to treat fairly the EBS tied agents.  I am not making little of the customers that were affected or any other issues relating to the bank, but that is the backdrop.  That is the EBS.  Through parliamentary questions, I think it was the Minister's Department that informed those who asked that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, would examine the issues they had.  However, IAASA would not do it.  It did not refuse to do it, but it did not actively pursue it.  When it was pushed, it said that it would deal with it but that it would deal with the complaint from the EBS-AIB behind closed doors.<\/p><p>That is what has the country the way it is.  Then the EBS tied agents went to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank will not investigate, even though under section 37 of the Building Societies Act 1989, the Central Bank has to ensure the EBS is financially sound, which brings us back to the root of this problem.  The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has refused to examine instances where banks have refused to disclose, or disclose correctly, their true financial position.  It goes back to the definition of \"capital losses\" used by the Irish Banking Resolution Corporation as well.  It is not compatible with that of the EU.  Regardless of whether we believe all of what is being said in that, against the backdrop of the activities of AIB it begins to emerge that all of these entities that are supposed to be in charge and have the powers do very little.  They pretend, and people go on suffering.  When I asked AIB about the EBS, it was reluctant to give any real update, because it is in mediation or the process is ongoing.  I consider that response from AIB to be absolutely shambolic.  In the light of all of that, I ask the Minister to tell AIB to stop the carry-on with the EBS tied agents and to bring about a resolution of some sort to the matter, in view of what the Central Bank said about AIB.  I do not know how it can be trusted.

The committee decided earlier that we will invite in some EBS tied agents again to continue to keep the pressure on them.  Just like those involved in the tracker mortgage issue, these people and their families are being hung out to dry by AIB.  I am sure that when they read the findings of the Central Bank, they must be utterly disgusted that they are dealing with that type of organisation.  I do not paint all of the employees in AIB with the one brush, but I certainly question the culture of its board and the management.  Any reasonable person would do that.<\/p> <p>  I have a second question for the Minister.  Is he surprised that there was no clear-out of directors, no sanction of managers at a higher level or anything like that?

The Chairman does that well.<\/p> <p>  On what the Central Bank has done, the overall fine that has been imposed is &euro;96.7 million.  My understanding is the reason a discount was made available was that alongside that, AIB accepted liability and did not look to dispute the penalty.  The current CEO of AIB was not CEO at the time when this issue occurred in relation to tracker mortgages.  From engaging with him, I believe he is committed to trying to bring the tracker mortgage issue to a resolution.

I am talking about the general culture, and the fact that at the end of the day, someone is responsible for it.  It has to be asked why no individual has been held to account, in spite of all of the destruction that all of the banks involved brought on the people of this country, who are supposed to be protected by the Government that they elect.  When representatives of the Central Bank first appeared before the committee, way back at the beginning of this, we were told that there were 3,000 to 4,000 cases, but the regulator was not sure.  In AIB alone, there were over 10,000 cases.  There are still some unresolved cases.  The banks are as difficult now, in bringing about a resolution to those outstanding accounts, as they were at the very beginning of this.  I find that totally unacceptable.  This House, the Minister and the Department are pushed to one side as we leave everything to the regulator.  The Minister is bringing in a new Central Bank Bill.  Will he, in that Bill, give authority to the regulator to say much more about fines that will be imposed in the future?  It is currently restricted, as I understand it, in certain ways.  I believe the public has a right to know what skullduggery was going on in the banks.  The regulator needs to have a freer hand to deal with a greedy industry that seems to have no rules or regulations in-house for itself.  The Minister said that AIB co-operated.  Why would it not co-operate?  We had witnesses all round this room who explained what happened to their homes and their families when AIB stripped them of their tracker mortgages and deprived them of the opportunity to have the matter dealt with.  It ignored its customers' rights.  That is outlined in the statement from the Central Bank.

Perhaps the Minister might arrange to give us an indicative position, please, on where the complaint went to because it had to do with a loss of revenue for the State.

I am joined by colleagues today, as outlined, Ms Mary Day, national director of acute operations; Dr. Mike O'Connor, national clinical advisor, acute operations; Professor Brian Lenehan, chief clinical director, UL Hospitals Group; and Ms Maria Bridgeman, chief officer, Mid West Community Healthcare.<\/p> <p>  I am sorry we were unable to attend this hearing in July, as Professor Lenehan and I were on sick leave.  We thank members for their understanding, as we both felt it was important that we should make ourselves personally available to the committee.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the main findings of the HIQA report.  I apologise for the distress and the lack of dignity and privacy experienced by far too many patients seeking to access care in UHL over several years and, in particular, over the past 18 months, when we have seen further growth in demand for healthcare following the Covid-19 pandemic.  This is not the kind of care environment we wish to provide for the people of the mid-west.  It is not for want of effort on the part of the management team or commitment on the part of our staff.  This is not the kind of report any hospital manager wishes to read, but we must respond to it and are responding to it.  <\/p> <p>  A detailed compliance plan developed in the wake of the HIQA report includes actions to be taken in the short, medium and long term.  The success of this plan hinges on the efforts of all stakeholders - locally and nationally and inside and outside of the hospital system.  We are working with the HSE national support team and with Mid West Community Healthcare to do just that - build on existing work and find new ways to meet growing demand.  We are improving internal processes and implementing new hospital avoidance initiatives.  The solutions also require closer integration with community services as set out in Sl&aacute;intecare and, more fundamentally, resourcing the heath service in the mid-west  in line with the size and the health needs of the population it serves.<\/p> <p>  We can discuss the way forward in greater detail with members this morning, but it is important we acknowledge the recent past and the local and national factors behind the extraordinary growth in demand on UHL.  The mid-west was an early mover on the reconfiguration of acute hospital services from 2009 on.<\/p><p>The Teamwork report on which that reorganisation was based recommended that UHL have 642 inpatient beds to manage the additional acute and emergency medical and surgical patients arising from the changes in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's hospitals.  This did not happen, chiefly because of the global financial crisis and the collapse of our public finances.  Today, our inpatient bed capacity is 530, far short of the recommendation and making no allowance for the increase in and rapid ageing of our population in the intervening 13 years.<\/p><p> It is important that I acknowledge the support we have received in developing services, expanding our workforce and strengthening diagnostic capacity - for example, through the addition of a second MRI scanner.  I want to acknowledge, in particular, the support of the Government, colleagues who are present and the HSE in increasing our bed capacity in UHL by 98 since the start of the pandemic.  We are moving ahead with our next 96-bed block but remain far short of where we need to be.  We are still playing catch-up.  Until our under-capacity is addressed, we will not eliminate hospital overcrowding in Limerick.<\/p><p> There has been extraordinary demand on our health services over the course of the pandemic and an extraordinary response to that demand.  In 2021, the emergency department, ED, at UHL saw a record 76,473 attendances.  In the first eight months of this year, we have seen a further increase in ED attendance of 7% and a further increase in ED admissions of 25%.  The number of over-75s attending our ED has risen by an even greater proportion.  Hospitals around the country are seeing an increase in demand for unscheduled care but the numbers for UHL are exceptional.  Between 2019 and 2021, we saw an increase of 20% in inpatient admissions at UHL and an increase of 15% in bed nights.<\/p><p> In 2021 we recruited more than 1,200 staff across UL Hospitals Group, increasing our headcount by 12%.  We have hired over 900 additional staff to date this year.<\/p><p> Since the start of the pandemic, we have opened 98 new single-room inpatient beds and ten new critical care beds.  We have opened new theatres and a new 24-bed block at Croom orthopaedic hospital.  We have run three Covid-19 mass-vaccination centres and the country's only operating field hospital during the course of the pandemic - the intermediate care facility at UL Sport Arena.<\/p><p> We hope the publication of the HIQA report will be the catalyst to address the fundamental mismatch between demand and resources that is particular to the mid-west.  We have communicated this in parliamentary replies to committee members over the years.  The mismatch is underlined in the findings of an external review on UHL that I commissioned Deloitte to undertake prior to the recent ministerial intervention and which we will shortly publish.  Nothing in this review alters the arithmetic, and we estimate that we are currently short of inpatient beds to meet demand.<\/p><p> Next month, the construction of a much-anticipated 96-bed block will commence in UHL, and this will go some way towards alleviating existing bed pressures.  This will include 48 new beds and 48 replacement beds.  Based on HSE guidance on hospital occupancy of between 80% and 85% and antimicrobial resistance and infection control recommendations on multi-occupancy rooms, UHL will continue to have a shortfall of 87 beds.  This does not take into account current unmet demand or projected future healthcare needs.  Based on our benchmarking with comparable hospitals, we have a shortage of non-consultant hospital doctors, with at least an additional 68 required.<\/p><p> We recognise that with any increase in resources must come a capacity to adapt and reform.  Our region has not been found wanting in this regard.  The decision to reconfigure how care was delivered in our hospitals was difficult for our community and staff but was taken in line with national policy and in response to another HIQA report which raised questions of patient safety.<\/p><p> Today, our model-2 hospitals - Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's - are seeing significant increases in activity at their injury units and at their medical assessment units.  There has been an increase of 63% in attendances at Ennis medical assessment unit since 2019 and a 47% increase at St. John's medical assessment unit.  These alternatives to emergency departments provide safe and efficient services that are highly valued by our community and our GP colleagues.  We are also working closely with colleagues in the community to provide alternatives to the emergency department.<\/p><p> The integrated care programme for older persons, ICPOP, is a community-based specialist service that provides rapid access to a multidisciplinarily-delivered comprehensive geriatric assessment for older adults living with frailty or at risk of developing frailty.  To date this year, ICPOP teams in Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary have received over 600 referrals.  There is currently no waiting list for this service, and service users are typically seen within seven days of a referral.<\/p><p> Almost 10,000 radiology tests were completed up to the end of August 2022 under the direct GP access community diagnostics programme.  Community intervention teams based in Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary focus on hospital avoidance and early supported discharge to the person's home.  Across Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary, these teams are currently supporting an average of 760 people each month.<\/p><p> Working with the HSE support team, we have refocused on internal processes and on closer integration with the community in recent weeks, resulting in a reduction in the number of admitted patients waiting for a bed and the removal of patients on trolleys on our wards.<\/p><p> This has been achieved through the appointment of additional staff, including a head of operational services for UHL and ten patient flow co-ordinators, of whom six are now in post.  In preparation for a challenging winter, we are working with the support team to put in additional medical and allied health professionals in the coming weeks, focused on our emergency departments and on an older persons assessment centre.  All of these initiatives reduce demand on acute services and mitigate the risks cited in the HIQA report and which we ourselves have identified and escalated.<\/p><p> Since the HIQA report has caused such concern in our region, I would like to address patient safety and outcomes more generally.  The annual audits of hospital mortality published by the National Office of Clinical Audit demonstrate that UHL continues to provide safe, quality services for its patients.  Similarly, national audits on stroke, heart attack and so on confirm that outcomes for patients in UHL are in line with those in hospitals around the country and are on par with, if not better than, those in other OECD countries.  These audits are published and available for all to read.  The outcomes show that, for all the challenges we face in UHL, we provide safe specialist care and that our staff are deeply committed to their patients and quality improvement.<\/p><p> I again apologise to each and every patient who has experienced excessive waiting times or a poor care environment in UHL.  We will do all in our power to address the shortcomings identified in the HIQA report.  We welcome the support of the national team and the wider recognition that significant resources are required to meet the exceptional health demands in the mid-west.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Colette Cowan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":646,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Cowan.

It is good to see such a good crowd here.  I know most of them and have tried to deal constructively with them over the past number of years.  I put on record my thanks to the staff who work in the hospital from hospital porters to cleaners, those in the kitchens, doctors, non-consultant doctors, management and those who work in administration - everybody who works in that hospital.  It is a very difficult environment and I want to put that on record.  The hospital has been given a task that is really difficult.  I have problems with some of the management and some of the way it works but I believe the hospital has been dealt a hard deck to deal with because the sums do not add up.  It must be put on record that we closed three emergency departments.  This is the core of what happened.  We closed the departments in St John's Hospital, Nenagh and Ennis and tried to integrate everybody into UHL, in what we were told at the time would be a centre of excellence.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, the funding to do that was never delivered.  My understanding, from the latest figures I have been given by the HSE and the Minister for Health, is that we are short 200 beds and 68 non-consultant doctors, which is the core of the problem we are looking at.  UHL, as Senator Conway has just said, has the highest level of overcrowding by far of any hospital in the State.  We are looking at a figure of 13,136 people on trolleys this year to date.  We still have three very difficult months to go until the end of the year, so we will potentially hit 16,000 or 17,000, if not more, and I am concerned that the winter will be very difficult for us.<\/p><p> Professor Cowan in her opening statement said that \"UHL will continue to have a shortfall of 87 beds\" if the HSE delivers the 96-bed unit, which will not be delivered for two years.  She also put a line into her statement about the shortage based on comparable hospitals, which should frighten all of us.  She is basically saying healthcare need is benchmarked against comparable hospitals.  She is actually saying, therefore, that the 96 beds will bring us only to where we are at the minute and will not take account of other stuff coming down the line.  We are looking at delivering 48 additional beds in the coming years and we have a trolley crisis now.<\/p><p> What is the Government's plan and what is the HSE's plan?  What has the HSE asked the Government to do?  I am not too bothered about what has happened - well, I am bothered about what has happened in the past, but it is the past.  I want to look at where we are now and where we can get to.  I deal with people, as the witnesses all do, every single day in that hospital.  I deal with the families in distress.  There are incredible waiting times for people.  We have had stories of people with dementia exiting the hospital and going missing for a while.  I have dealt recently with three families who have had family members with dementia leave the hospital.  It is very traumatic for their families and, in fairness, for the staff as well.  In Limerick - and I would not be the only person to say this - people are not going to the ED.  They are afraid to do so.  Older people, especially, do not want to go there because they know they will be there for hours and hours.<\/p><p> What immediate steps are being taken to address the overcrowding in the here and now?  The 48 beds, or the 96 beds which, as I said, will deliver 48 beds, while very welcome, will take a couple of years to come, so I want to know what is happening in the here and now.  What support does the HSE need from the Government to make an immediate impact on this issue?  Do the witnesses think the appropriate level of care can consistently be delivered to those being treated in such conditions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#C02900","speaker":"1509","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":678,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Quinlivan.  We will extend his thanks to the staff, who are fantastic and who do a very difficult job every day.<\/p> <p>  Once again, we are very clear that we do not support or feel comfortable about patients having to wait in the emergency department, but it is a capacity issue for us.  What are our plans?  The Deputy is quite right that the 96-bed block will take two years to build, which is quite fast but still too long for us.  It will be 48 replacement beds because, as the Deputy will know, we have Nightingale wards, which are not safe, and our outbreaks in the hospital around infection control are, in the main, in those large wards.  They are no longer SARI-compliant.  The replacement beds are exceptionally important for us.  What is the plan?  We have looked at our capital development plan.  We have also looked at the developments in the community because, heretofore, the societal view has been that everybody comes to the emergency department for treatment and care.  The Deputy is quite right that we would all stop and think about whether we should go to an emergency department and whether we want to wait long hours for treatment.  However, we are only in the infancy of developing services in the enhanced community care programme, which my colleague, Ms Bridgeman, will speak to.  That will create alternatives for older people especially to go elsewhere other than into our emergency department for treatment.  It is important to be aware of that.  We have to balance that significant budget, and funding has come from the Government into the enhanced community care programme.  That is a number of years of project work that will go ahead.  UHL, in particular, is a very busy hospital, and all our patients tell us that once they get in, the care is good and they get through the system.  It is a matter of getting through the emergency department doors.  With the bed capacity issues, we are working towards that.  We have done a lot of work in developing the services.  It is our view, however, that we need a second 96-bed block.  We have started working on that and talking to the system about what that would look like but, again, that would be five to ten years away.  What we have to measure under the health population needs, on which a significant work is about to commence, is how many patients will divert from the ED to the enhanced community care programme and how many patients will be in our hospitals getting emergency care.  UHL is an emergency care hospital, a complex surgery hospital and a designated cancer centre.  Other work will have to be diverted to other areas.

The Government needs to treat it as an emergency because it is simply not acceptable that people in Limerick and the mid-west region have such long wait times at the hospital.  The figure the HSE gave me recently was that 8,000 people were waiting more than 24 hours.  What is happening is absolutely criminally negligent.  It is not exactly all the HSE's fault, but there is no plan from the Government apart from 48 beds to be delivered in two years' time.

There are patients other than the emergency department patients who are at home worried about their surgery, so we invade, for want of a better word, the surgical space with medical patients.

What, then, are we doing now to improve the situation with trolleys and overcrowding in our ED?  There has been incremental improvement in recent weeks, which has been sustained.  That is being achieved in a number of ways.  The appointment of a head of service is key because the focus there is on patient flow, on decompressing the ED and on ensuring that all potential discharges are facilitated.  We have put in the patient flow co-ordinators, who are working on the ground at ward level identifying patients who can be discharged because once a patient is discharged, that bed has to be cleaned and turned around for a patient to come from the ED.  We have enhanced triage in the ED now, with additional nurses in triage and consultant-assisted triage, so the triage times are coming down.  Our patient experience times, PETs, are coming down.  The number of patients discharged daily has increased, the utilisation of our community beds and contracted beds has increased, the referral rate to rehab has increased, and the number of patients experiencing a delayed transfer of care has come down significantly.<\/p> <p>  All those small pieces, incrementally, speak to patient flow.  They generate capacity within the system, and that is why we see today the number of trolleys that are there compared with the number this day last year.  We need to build on that, use the funding we have been provided with to sustain that, use the additional consultants and NCHDs in the emergency department to improve the time it takes to see a doctor and the time it takes to get a test, and look at building on the work that has been done with frailty to the fore and OPTI-MEND, which are two areas that focus on the over-75s and admit fewer patients because there is an alternative whereby they have access to the OPTI-MEND team and the frailty team and can be referred to the ICPOP services in the community.  It is therefore a joined-up effort and it is probably ten or 15 small things that will lead to the incremental change.<\/p><p>We need to sustain and drive that.  We are doing that with the support of the HSE, its performance management and improvement unit and the staff on the ground supported by the executive management team.  We will have people on trolleys but I hope the number will be far less than heretofore.  Winter is coming and I do not know what will happen with Covid or flu.  All we can do is respond and redouble our efforts.  As with Professor Cowan, as chief clinical director, I too want to apologise to patients who have a negative experience in our emergency department.

Certainly, the staff who cared for my family member recently were incredible.<\/p> <p>  Where are the staff shortages and what areas need to be built up?  The Neurological Alliance of Ireland\u00a0told the committee that more neurological nurses are needed.  We heard about different areas.  One of the issues I want to home in on is discharge co-ordinators and the inability to send people home at weekends when they are ready to go home.  This happens too often.  Two years ago, when a different member of my family was in hospital and ready to go home at 5 o'clock one Friday evening, as the nurses and everyone else on the ward could see, a discharge co-ordinator or consultant could not be found to sign off the discharge until the following Monday or Tuesday.  My family member was, therefore, a bed blocker who prevented somebody else on a corridor in the accident and emergency department in need of a bed from being moved to the ward.  This is an ongoing problem.  How is the out-of-hours discharge of patients dealt with?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses should not take my critique personally but how can the management group have oversight of what happens in the hospital environment when it is based in an office block located 1.5 km from the hospital?  I was a schoolteacher before I became a Deputy and my principal had an office down the corridor.  In Garda stations, the superintendent has an office down the corridor.  There is no way a management team can manage and oversee an acute hospital environment when based a distance away in an industrial estate.  The office must be in the acute environment.  I know the UL Hospitals Group has several hospitals.  Management cannot be based in an office block located a distance away from where everything is happening.  I do not expect management to walk every single ward and check every bed every day but surely managers must be on site, as the HIQA report identified.

Patients who have any symptoms or signs of Covid, or who have any risk of infectious disease, be that CPE, C. diff, or MRSA, are all in zones B and C.  When the inspectors entered, they saw 49 or 50 trolleys, as well as the cubicles at capacity.  Those patients who required isolation were in the cubicles and the remainder of the patients were on trolleys in the emergency department.  The inspectors came in and looked at the number of nurses that were there.  Through vacancies and short-term illness and last-minute sickness, there was a deficit in the number of nurses available to look after those patients.  We had redeployed additional nurses, and we do have healthcare attendants who also support our nurses in the care of our patients.  This all challenged the emergency department.

In recent weeks, however, we have noticed that more of the younger staff are leaving to travel the world or to emigrate.  Equally, 38 staff left the emergency department last year.  From exit interviews, we know that 17 of those resigned to work elsewhere, for family reasons and for travel, and 29 were promoted.

While that was Government policy, it was not Government policy to close three EDs and leave only one.  There were 35 ED beds between the hospitals of UHL, Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's and overnight, the number was reduced to 17 ED beds.  That was not policy.  There were to be 136 co-location beds on the grounds of UHL.  It was not policy to close the other EDs before the co-location beds were built.  We have played catch-up ever since, so let me put the record straight.  Reconfiguration in health is fine but we went from four EDs to one ED, so capacity reduced from 35 ED beds to 17 ED beds.  These were local decisions that were made at the time so I want to see the following.<\/p> <p>  In terms of whatever submission that the HSE has submitted seeking resources, we deal with people on the ground so we know that the trolley count and the number of people on trolleys must be reduced to a manageable level.  The trolley counts are growing at the moment.  Whatever resources are required, and if the PMIU has been in and is saying that everything that can be done is being done, then the HSE must pony up with the money for UHL and the group to ensure that we can get the services, including community care in terms of stepdown.  We, as public representatives, must ring the hospitals too much because people are approaching us.  Last night, I was rung about an elderly man who had been left on a trolley for two days although he was looked after.  I accept there are capacity issues but if resources are required I would expect, Dr. O'Connor, that the PMIU and the HSE will provide those resources.  Yes, we need extra elective capacity.

The HIQA inspection happened on a particular day and Professor Cowan's response is about how challenging that particular day was for the hospital, but we know that many days are challenging for UHL.

The group was non-compliant in terms of planning, organising and managing the workforce to achieve high-quality and safe healthcare.  This is a management issue.  If the group is lacking resources, that would make compliance more difficult, but planning, organising and managing the workforce rests with management.<\/p> <p>  The dignity, privacy and autonomy of patients should be promoted, but I heard one elderly lady, whose husband unfortunately passed away in the hospital, speaking on RT&Eacute; about how long he had stayed on a hospital trolley and the lack of dignity.  Basic measures should be put in place in any hospital to ensure that there is proper dignity and respect for patients, but the hospital was non-compliant in this regard once again.  I will reinforce what \"non-compliant\" means in terms of the grading system.  It means that \"the relevant national standard has not been met, and that this deficiency is such that it represents a significant risk to people using the service\".  The hospital was also non-compliant in its protection of users from risk of harm associated with the design and delivery of healthcare services.<\/p> <p>  Given that HIQA was clearly pointing to failures in management, planning and delivery, I would hope that the management of the hospital group would at least take some responsibility for some of those failures.  I know that there are capacity problems and I am supportive of new capacity being put in place, but people listening in Limerick and the wider mid-west who use these services would like to hear from the management that it accepts some responsibility for some of the failures outlined by HIQA.  If the witnesses do not believe that they are responsible for any of these failures, that is their view and they might articulate it.

My aim and drive every day is to ensure that patients who walk into the emergency department and who may have to wait are treated when they arrive, are seen and that they get care in the system.  We work on this all day every day.  I spent two hours with HIQA the day it was on site.  We spoke at length about all of the issues we have discussed here today.  HIQA is a very supportive regulator and works with us.<\/p><p> We do feel responsible and accountable.  We have come through a pandemic after two years.  We have a fatigued workforce.  We know that.  We are trying to work with them and put in all sorts of improvements to help them.  It is a continuous cycle of improvement.  At the end of the day, if the ambulance service brings us on average 400 additional patients a month for care and people attend our emergency department instead of going to other areas, we have to deal with that.  It is difficult and we are sorely sorry for patients who have to wait in an emergency department.  Believe me, we have all experienced it with our families.  The wait time is very difficult.

It would be far better if we could get enough nurses to work in our services.  We are highly dependent now on international recruitment, as Professor Cowan said.  This is especially the case in our older persons units.  We have similar problems across our mental health services to our colleagues in the acute hospitals, with people retiring or resigning, or, in the case of younger staff, leaving to travel.

I acknowledge the work of Professor Cowan and her management team in UHL.  It is challenging.  I also recognise the work of Ms Bridgeman and her team on the community side of things.  There have been many advancements, even if we look at community healthcare.  I refer to investments in all our community hospitals, including those in Kilrush and Raheen, or the new community hospital planned for Ennis, which will be state-of-the-art.  There has also been investment in primary care centres.  A fabulous facility will be opened on the Station Road in Ennis and another is planned for the Tulla Road.  It is the same with Sixmilebridge and Killaloe.  These are positive developments from a community care point of view.<\/p><p>The glaring problem, however, is with our accident and emergency departments and the waiting times.  Like every public representative in this room, on this committee and in this D&aacute;il, I get calls concerning this problem and the hardship families go through.  Patients end up lying on trolleys for extended periods of time.  This issue came to a head with the HIQA report.  We also had the performance improvement unit going into the hospital.  I would like to understand how that process works.  I understand there was an initial visit in June, which was followed by a month-long stay in July, and that a further visit is planned.  When is it expected it will be possible to report back with recommendations following the visit to the hospital?<\/p><p><b>Dr. Mike O'Connor:<\/b>As the Deputy mentioned, the visit was for one month.  In the first week, a deep dive was started to consider what might be the near-term opportunities to improve patient flow.  Additionally, the process was absolutely collaborative.  Therefore, this suite of actions is owned by the people in UHL.  It is not a case of us prescribing actions, even though we did lean into some prescription items.  We focused on several areas, especially concerning optimising the integration between community and acute hospitals.  Equally, and has been mentioned several times, we have specifically and strongly suggested having a specific area for patients aged over 75, because the second highest attendance comes from people in that cohort.  This is a significant issue.  As we heard, that initiative will be operational in October.  The third aspect, which is technical, is that at any one time about 10% to 12% of patients admitted to any hospital will stay for longer than 14 days, and they use about 60% of bed days.  A small percentage of people admitted, therefore, about one-tenth of the patients, will stay for an extended time.  There are multiple reasons for those outcomes.<\/p><p>We have brought a collaborative focus with UHL on digging down into those pages to see where the delays and blocks lie.  In addition, there are a number of other areas around redesign of rotas and rosters.  The piece is not so much a report - even though we will likely generate a report at the end - is actually owned by UHL, which is a better place to be.  There are enough reports, such as the HIQA report.  We are working alongside UHL and CHO to look at the short to medium term plan.  We have heard clearly about the medium to long term plan, which nestles into capacity elective bed capacity.  We clearly support that also.  Our brief was to look at what we could do in the short term and bricks and mortar were not part of that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#M01100","speaker":"1517","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":872,"content":"<p>There is a proposal of which Professor Cowan will be aware regarding a bed bureau for the UL Hospitals Group.

I have had family who trained in the hospital in earlier years and are near retirement age now.  It was - and I emphasise \"was\" - the best training hospital in the country at that time.  Student nurses wanted to go there to be trained because of what it meant to be trained in UHL.  My biggest concerns with the hospital are, one, the HIQA inspection and, two, my concern since I have been a Teachta D&aacute;la and before about morale of the staff.<\/p><p> I spent time in the hospital in February when I overturned my car.  I hate saying this but UHL was not my first choice.  I went to St. John's Hospital first and was sent back to UHL.  I asked if they could send me somewhere else and they said no.  For me to say that, who wants UHL to be the top hospital in the country, is not only a concern for me but should be a massive concern for the witnesses.<\/p><p> The biggest issue I saw in UHL was the lack of reporting of minor and major incidents.  I spoke to a lot of staff in the hospital, ranging from porters right up to the top.  I am not taking a picture from one sector only.  They felt it was like being bullied in the hospital if they reported something.  That is not right.  Huge money has been spent in UHL on legal fees in challenges to different things that have happened in the hospital.  If that funding was put towards extra resources, training and induction, it would help our hospital.<\/p><p> Morale within the hospital has to be right for people to get back in there.  The structure within the hospital has to be right for people to get back in there and want to nurse there.  Consider the amount of nursing staff who have left the hospital.  I talked to people as I went from every part of the hospital to where I had to go to.  They said the biggest problem was emergency services.  When they got to other sections of the hospital, they could become nurses again, but they felt it was like wartime every time they went to work in the emergency services.  They went in to do their job and do their best and left stressed, saying they could not help somebody because of the overcrowding in the hospital.  I was on a trolley when I was there and was moved from one section to another.  In one section, there was a machine alongside me.  They had to move three trolleys to get that machine out and get it to somebody who needed it.  There was a line of people along the corridors.  There were papers put on doors to block me seeing trolleys lined out on other corridors, in a hospital I want to see being the best in the country.<\/p><p> There have been fatalities in that hospital because of non-reporting of minor and major incidents.   I will not mention the case because the Chair outlined the situation.  A case has been going on for three years where a young girl died in that hospital and, if the major incident had been reported, that person would not have been allowed to do that surgery.  The case has been held up and stonewalled for three years.  It is a legal thing that is being covered up because it will show up the hospital for its inadequate-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#N03000","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":902,"content":"<p>Be careful where you are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#O00200","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I will not mention any names.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#O00300","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":904,"content":"<p>You are making suggestions that something illegal or whatever-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#O00400","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":905,"content":"<p>I have already put this on the record of the D&aacute;il so am quoting what I have already quoted.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#O00500","speaker":"1499"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":906,"content":"<p>I am just asking you to be careful where you are going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#O00600","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":907,"content":"<p>Okay.  Other incidents have happened in the hospital and it takes so long for legal to find out what happens.  There is a cost to that, when that money could be used otherwise if somebody says we got it wrong and should put our hands up, that it should have been identified and reported, that we could have helped faster and used the money being used on legal - which is rising in UHL in the last number of years of challenges - rather than going into the healthcare and staffing that is needed to build the hospital back to the number one hospital in Ireland.  That is all I want.<\/p> <p>  I am not here to have a go directly at Professor Cowan, but she is the manager, boss and CEO.  It is frustrating from the outside looking in.  The management is in the firing line because they should have it structured in such a way that this happens.  That is my major concern for UHL.  I want it to grow and be the best training hospital.  I want nurses and staff lining up outside the door saying they want to get in, but look at the statistics for nurse placements this year in colleges.  They had to drop points all over to try to get people we need back into nursing and the caring system.  That is something I want to build.<\/p> <p>  I have been in the hospital on numerous occasions.  I was recently in the Mater hospital with a son of mine who had a spinal operation.  I was looking at the different structures, backups and teams they had.  They probably have more space and facilities than UHL.<\/p> <p>  What will the witnesses do about minor and major incidents and making sure a person who wants to report one will not be told they cannot report this or that person?  It is for the betterment of the hospital and to make sure the hospital runs efficiently.  It will bring down the number of legal challenges it will have.

I assure the Deputy that once an incident is raised, it is investigated in line with the incident management framework.  It is categorised.  It has a preliminary assessment done and can be closed out if it is minor, and there are learnings from that.  If it requires a more substantial investigation it goes on to a systems analysis, which can be an internal or external review.

Our view is that the elective hospital would assist the model 4 hospitals, but reopening emergency departments at other sites would require significant investment, and there would be safety issues concerning care.  For example, if as a member of the public I went to Nenagh hospital clasping my chest with a heart attack, I would like to know I was going to a cardiologist who stents every day of the week.  That would not be the case in Nenagh hospital.

Then we need a scheduled care facility so that scheduled care is not interrupted by unscheduled care.  They are both different to the need for a model 3 hospital or a model 3S hospital.

That is with rehabilitation and enablement units and by investing in supporting enablement units.  There is a bed stock of 392 in the region of community units.  Looking in that direction, however, at any one time there are a large number of patients in model 4, model 3 hospitals and even model 2 hospitals who actually would need to be in an enablement unit.

As they have advised Government, they support having elective hospitals in counties Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Is it frustrating to the witnesses that the chain of command right up to Mr. Watt and Mr. Reid does not believe it should happen?  That is very evident.  They kept saying it is for Government to decide.  However, their recommendation is for counties Dublin, Cork and Galway.  That is the recommendation Sl&aacute;intecare and the Department of Health gave to the Minister and Cabinet by way of memo.  That is what the advice has been.  Therefore, somewhere in that vertical chain of command there is somebody who does not believe in an elective hospital.  Does that frustrate the witnesses?

There is an element of looking at scheduled care facilities, repurposing, looking at additional theatres and how we repurpose bed stocks or create the surgical care hubs we require.

For all his positives and flaws, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and whoever becomes the next Minister after him and so on will follow the advice of his or her chief advisers.  The Sl&aacute;intecare all-party advisory group buys into that.  It does not recommend an elective hospital in Limerick, Clare or anywhere in the mid-west.  There is a flaw here.  I say this in support of all the witnesses.  They know and live this every day.  They know what is required but their senior management do not, and that is not the advice they are giving to Government.  Therefore, for this Government and the Government that will come after, this will perpetuate itself because we have somebody there who does not believe in it.<\/p> <p>  I will move on.  I would really like the HSE to do some capacity mapping.  This became a buzz word during the Ukrainian war.  The Department of Education was able to very quickly capacity map where it had schools, resources and everything.  I would love to see the HSE do some capacity mapping in the mid-west in terms of GP and dental care.  Just yesterday, a report was launched across the street in Buswell's Hotel on poverty in County Clare.  It identified that comparative to the Irish average, County Clare is 33% behind in terms of GP care.  We are 50% behind in terms of dental care, something to which I can attest.  I have had a broken tooth for five weeks.  This is something each member here can tell the witnesses anecdotally.  We know it on the ground.  We would love the HSE to capacity map to identify where those grey areas are in west Clare and north Clare.  Can the HSE please map it out for us at some point and tell us where the deficiencies are?  We cannot get personnel back there to provide community-level healthcare.

The blood ran out of the care team's faces because hospital staff did not know this.  They discharged this person after some weeks.  Not every person in their 80s will disclose their full medical history.  They presume it will be on a screen somewhere in the hospitals.  Information systems in Ireland seem to be chronic.

They said that staff morale is low, which is very easy to imagine, as was management morale.  Perhaps the representatives cannot comment on this but those who contacted me cited the fact that financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, came in 14 years ago, but pay grades that were approved to management have not been implemented.  They said it is very galling for management to try to lead initiative after initiative, and pick themselves up every single week to try to drive on UHL group, while people above them have had &euro;81,000 pay-grade pay rises and they have had nothing.  They said to me - they had the liberty of being able to say this because they had retired from UHL - that it is galling and demoralising.  They said they try to pick themselves up every day but how can they when the chiefs above them have had pay increase after pay increase, while they have not had pay restoration, morale is low and how can they lead on something?  It resonated with me.  That is something that has never really been out there in the ether.  It has to be a factor.  When morale is low, how can people drive on a ship?

In the response to Deputy Carey, I was quite taken aback that it was said the only meeting that was had with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, was when he visited the hospital in Limerick.  I would have thought, as CEO, that the Minister would have wanted to engage, especially given the media attention that UHL receives on a regular basis as a result of the trolley numbers.

We should not forget we are moving into a more integrated system and all of the capacity cannot just be about UHL.  It is also about our community capacity, our rehab facilities, our model 1 hospitals and our community nursing homes.

I listened to the opening statement and Professor Cowan talked about the reconfiguration that occurred back in 2009.  They were looking for 642 beds at that stage and they got 530.  There was a shortfall of 112 beds.  Even with the new unit that would propose beds, they would still be short of them.  We also heard this morning the fact the population has risen since then.  Further to some of the focus this morning, we cannot manufacture these beds, but what can we do in relation to the capacity within the system?<\/p> <p>  We have had representatives of other hospital groups and hospitals in and they have been quite innovative in some of the responses.  There is one hospital in the Dublin area that has experts going out in the ambulance service, particularly for dealing with older people.  We have heard tales of the errors in beds.  That is one example.  We have not touched on the issue of step-down beds this morning.  Is there an issue there?  The relationship with the local authority, again, in some areas is better than others, especially for the whole area of independent living, housing adaptation and so on.  Again, we have not looked at the wider picture of that.<\/p> <p>  I have another question in the couple of minutes that are left.  I outlined some areas, but I refer to looking at best practice in other areas.  For example, this committee met in relation to some of the regionalisation that will be going on.  One of the concerns we had was there would not be that interaction within the system and learning from other areas where clearly systems are working and innovative, are not costing a huge amount, but that work and deliver for people.  Are our witnesses confident that, moving forward, collaboration will still continue?  What plans do they have for tweaking the system?  The minor injuries clinic and other areas were mentioned.  Are there still shortfalls they could make up in relation to the fact that they will always be in a difficult situation regarding a shortage of beds within UHL?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#S00500","speaker":"1571"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I will defer to Professor Lenehan presently.

We have looked at smart cities and innovative working for elderly in the home.  There is a quite an interesting document from Limerick City and County Council on how that would work.

If there are fewer patients being conveyed to the hospital, we will have fewer attendances.  It is to be hoped that translates to fewer admissions and fewer trolleys.<\/p> <p>  The more we learn from what has worked well in other groups, the better we will do.  These challenges are not unique to University Limerick Hospitals Group.  It could be representatives of any of the model 4 hospitals sitting here discussing these challenges.

From the community perspective, we work very closely in collaboration with our colleagues in the hospital.  We have a bed capacity across the community services of 492 beds, which Dr. O&rsquo;Connor referenced earlier, 342 of which are for long-stay or nursing home support scheme, NHSS, capacity.  We have a total rehab complement of 88 beds, of which 25 of those have come on stream over the past year or year and a half.  In addition to that, we have 75 transitional short-stay contracted beds with private providers across the system.  We have quite a number of beds available for that transitional care.<\/p> <p>  In addition to what Professor Cowan said, I am now currently the chair of the mid-west interagency group.  Therefore, I chair the group with the Garda and county councils of the three counties and my colleague, Professor Cowan, is on that group with us.  We have quite a lot of different initiatives ongoing with the county council, for example, healthy communities and age friendly initiatives.  Our health and well-being department, particularly, works very closely with them.  We sit on their local community development committees, LCDCs, and we are also involved in developing LCPs with them.  There is quite a lot of active work going on there.<\/p> <p>  We are also currently working with the Garda in respect of developing a new project, for which we have put in a bid to the Estimates.  It will have HSE clinicians working closely with the Garda in dealing with vulnerable people who are in crisis at that particular time.  That is a project we hope will get funded and come on stream.  Again, that will certainly help patients go to the right care and place and avoid either ending up in a jail cell or in the emergency department.<\/p><p>We hope that this will be funded.  In addition to helping people avoid coming to the hospital., we have seen a significant increase in funding and in access to diagnostics.  As Professor Cowan noted in her opening statement, GPs now have direct access to a number of diagnostics and since this has been introduced, there have been over 10,000 referrals.  In addition, last week we commenced a mobile diagnostic service in the mid-west.  As an example, up to yesterday, 12 people have used this mobile diagnostic system and as a result, ten people avoided hospital because they had their results and therefore did not have to go.  There is a huge amount of innovative work and a lot of initiatives happening across the community services that will have an impact on emergency departments and on hospital avoidance but most importantly, will help benefit the people of the mid-west and the patients by providing care, as per Sl&aacute;intecare, nearer to home where they want it and getting the right care in the right place.  The financial impact of what we have been given in the community will really be very beneficial going forward.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2022092100002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Bridgeman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":993,"content":"<p>Can I ask two additional questions?

Currently, we have secured moneys for a new project for a CAMHS hub in Limerick city and we plan to base that in the St. Joseph's Hospital complex at the moment.  In addition to that, it will provide telehealth medicine and will be a support for children as they step up and step down from the CAMHS unit in Galway, for example.

N&iacute;l aon phlean ann chun scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge a bhun&uacute; chun an 20% seo a bhaint amach.  In ionad sin, di&uacute;lta&iacute;tear d&aacute;r n-iarratais, mar a tharla i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath 6.

Mar shampla, nuair at&aacute; foirgneamh nua &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il ag an Roinn, n&iacute;l aon treoir ann ag an dara leibh&eacute;al ar c&eacute;n dearadh gur ch&oacute;ir a bheith ar aonad l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge i me&aacute;nscoileanna.  T&oacute;gtar na haonaid seo gan aon aird ar an nGaeilge n&aacute; gan aon chinnteacht nach mbeadh aon ionsa&iacute; ar an nGaeilge &oacute; l&aacute; go l&aacute; ag B&eacute;arl&oacute;ir&iacute; na scoile.  Is f&eacute;idir le p&aacute;tr&uacute;in a r&aacute; nach bhfuil aon treoir ann &oacute;n Roinn agus, mar sin, t&oacute;gtar an foirgneamh sa chaoi go bhfuil ionsa&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar an nGaeilge.  N&iacute; thagann an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n amh&aacute;in &oacute;n Roinn Oideachas mar t&aacute; s&eacute; curtha in i&uacute;l ag tuismitheoir&iacute; d&aacute;r scoileanna go bhfuil s&iacute;ceolaithe &oacute;n bhfeidhmeannas sl&aacute;inte ag moladh gan a bp&aacute;ist&iacute; le riachtanais speisialta a sheoladh chuig scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge.

Bheadh an creat Eorpach d&rsquo;fhoghlaim teangacha mar chro&iacute;l&aacute;r an pholasaithe nua agus cheangl&oacute;dh s&eacute; foghlaim na Gaeilge ag gach leibh&eacute;al &oacute;n r&eacute;amhscoil go dt&iacute; an tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al.  D&rsquo;fheadfadh dalta&iacute; le deacrachta&iacute; foghlama n&oacute; aon dalta ag teacht isteach d&eacute;anach &oacute; thar lear an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ar scoil ag na leibh&eacute;il is oiri&uacute;na&iacute; d&oacute;ibh agus point&iacute; ardteistim&eacute;ireachta a bheith ar f&aacute;il d&oacute;ibh bunaithe air seo.  Faoin gc&oacute;ras seo, mar shampla, bheadh dalta le deacracht scr&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge in ann an scr&uacute;d&uacute; b&eacute;il amh&aacute;in a dh&eacute;anamh don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht agus a bheith i dteideal point&iacute; L&aacute;r-Oifig Iontr&aacute;la in ionad a bheith scartha amach &oacute;n rang Gaeilge &oacute;n mbunscoil ar aghaidh.  Laghd&oacute;dh s&eacute; seo an g&aacute; le d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; a bhronnadh agus chinnteodh s&eacute; freastail cothrom agus s&aacute;s&uacute;il don bhreis is 100,000 dalta a bheidh th&iacute;os leis an gc&oacute;ras reatha faoi 2030.  Is g&aacute; gn&iacute;omh&uacute; air seo anois gan a thuilleadh moille.<\/p> <p>  Sula gcr&iacute;ochna&iacute;m, ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh don chinneadh at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Aire Oideachais p&aacute;ip&eacute;ar 1 Gaeilge don ardteistim&eacute;ireacht a bhogadh go deireadh bhliain a c&uacute;ig.  De r&eacute;ir an eolais at&aacute; faighte ag an gconradh faoin Acht um Shaor&aacute;il Faisn&eacute;ise, 2014 maidir leis an gcinneadh seo, is l&eacute;ir nach raibh aon bhun&uacute;s oideachas&uacute;il ag baint leis an gcinneadh seo agus nach raibh aon phl&eacute; d&eacute;anta le m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; Gaeilge faoi na himpleachta&iacute; a bhaineann leis an athr&uacute; seo.  N&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sin, ach bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-soil&eacute;ir go raibh Coimisi&uacute;n na Scr&uacute;duithe St&aacute;it buartha faoin bplean.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; go minic sa chomhfhreagras go mbeadh g&aacute; na sonra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a athbhreithni&uacute; agus a chur in oiri&uacute;int d&aacute; mbogfa&iacute; p&aacute;ip&eacute;ar 1 chun tosaigh n&iacute;os mo n&aacute; c&uacute;pla seachtain agus luaigh s&eacute; an m&iacute;bhunt&aacute;iste a d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh a bheith ann do bhuachaill&iacute; &oacute; thaobh aib&iacute;ochta de agus an cheapad&oacute;ireacht &aacute; scr&uacute;d&uacute; ag deireadh bhliain a c&uacute;ig.  Cuireann s&eacute; iontas orainn go ndeachaigh an Roinn Oideachais ar aghaidh leis an moladh ach &eacute; sin r&aacute;ite t&aacute; an cinneadh ag teacht leis an gcinneadh maidir leis na d&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; agus neamhaird a dh&eacute;anamh ar an toradh oideachas&uacute;la is fearr don dalta.  D&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfadh impleachta&iacute; a bheith aige seo ar ch&oacute;ras reatha na nd&iacute;ol&uacute;int&iacute; chomh maith.

Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; seans ann go mbainfear m&iacute;-&uacute;s&aacute;id as an d&iacute;ol&uacute;ine le scr&uacute;d&uacute; ag deireadh bhliain a c&uacute;ig a sheachaint.

It is good to see those who did not travel with us to Bere Island earlier this month.  I am aware the joint committee met in private session last week and we can discuss the issues further in private session later, if that is agreed.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased today to continue discussion on the general scheme of the charities (amendment) Bill 2022, which was recently referred to us by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Heather Humphreys, for pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee.  The principal primary legislation governing the operation of charities in Ireland is the Charities Act 2009, which provided for a definition of charities, their operation and reporting requirements, and the establishment of a regulatory authority.  The purpose of the Bill before us is to strengthen the charity sector, ensuring  greater transparency, clarity and fairness, which would serve to enhance public confidence in the sector.  The proposals contained in the general scheme seek to improve the operational capacity of the charities regulator in order to conduct its statutory functions, ensuring more proportionate regulation for the sector.<\/p> <p>  More than four out of every ten registered charities, of those who are incorporated, do not currently have to submit an annual statement of accounts to the regulator.  A number of amendments to the Charities Act 2009 have been proposed under the general scheme which would remove this exemption whereby the relevant accounting and reporting requirements in the 2009 Act do not apply to the charities that are companies.  At the other end of the spectrum, the existing financial threshold for audit is placing an unnecessary financial burden on small volunteer-led charities, thus making it harder to obtain volunteers to run such organisations, many of which are providing vital local services in communities throughout our country.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased today to have the opportunity to consider this matter and I would like to welcome officials from Charities Institute Ireland, The Wheel, and Mason, Hayes &amp;amp; Curran LLP.  I welcome Ms Alice Murphy, partner with Mason, Hayes &amp;amp; Curran LLP; Ms &Aacute;ine Myler, chief executive officer of Charities Institute Ireland; and Mr. Ivan Cooper, director of policy at The Wheel.  You are all very welcome this morning.<\/p> <p>  In terms of privilege, witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  For witnesses participating remotely and from outside the precincts of Leinster House, they are reminded that parliamentary privilege does not apply in their case, and the same level of caution should be applied as previously mentioned.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<\/p> <p>  I now call on Ms &Aacute;ine Myler to make her opening statement.

We support this Bill and its objectives to further develop the regulatory framework for registered charities in Ireland.  The proposals, observations and commentary that follow are intended as constructive and informed inputs into the development of the legislation.  We are acutely aware the Bill represents the sole opportunity for legislative development and amendment for the short and medium term.  There will be only one opportunity to get this right for the charities regulator, and for our sector.<\/p> <p>  The charity sector is exceptionally diverse with a long history of making an important and unique contribution to our economy, community life and civil society.  Charities deliver a wide range of supports and services, including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education and health, protection of the environment, and the support of our most vulnerable citizens.  There are almost 12,000 registered charities and a further 20,000 plus organisations in Ireland's wider non-profit sector.<\/p> <p>  Some key statistics for our sector include combined annual turnover of more than &euro;14.5 billion.  In a 2018 report published by the Charities Regulator, Indecon estimated that total direct, indirect, and induced value of the impact of the work of Ireland's charities exceeds &euro;24 billion.  All charities work for the public benefit.  This means there is no gain or benefit to trustees or members.  Many of Ireland's charities are funded or part-funded by the State, and they form a critical part of our economic and social infrastructure.<\/p><p>The Wheel and Charities Institute Ireland, Cii, is tasked by our members to represent their views, amplify their voices and ensure that proportionality, parity of esteem and respect are core tenets of and expectations from engagement with policymakers and officials.  <\/p><p> This legislation is long awaited by our sector and we are encouraged by many of the positive proposals, such as the inclusion of the advancement of human rights as a charitable purpose, the alignment with the Companies Act 2014 for financial reporting and along with the lifting of the audit threshold to &euro;250,000, the release from liability of court-appointed charity trustees for the consequences of decisions and actions that preceded their appointment and ensuring company secretaries are not automatically regarded as trustees of a charity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>There are several areas where significant concerns have arisen in relation to the proposed provisions.  In addition, some of the proposals could overload the Charities Regulatory Authority with an unwieldy administrative burden, producing limited regulatory value and, in any event, it would not be possible without providing substantial additional resources.  We agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O&rsquo;Brien, when he says that it is important that the legislation &ldquo;strikes the right balance between proportionate regulation and governance, ensuring that a reasonable and fair approach is at its core&rdquo;.  In its present form, this draft legislation does not fully support this objective.<\/p> <p>  We have named the top five issues which could adversely affect charities in their day-to-day work and our sector&rsquo;s ability to recruit and retain trustees to our boards, without whom charities cannot function.  First, the proposed extension of very significant additional powers of direction and sanction to the Charities Regulator; in particular the disproportionate power to deregister charities for a range of minor non-compliances.  Second, insufficiently strong appeals processes and insufficient recognition of potential reputational damage to charities occurring prior to any finding of fact during an investigation.  Third, the unreasonable and likely unworkable requirement for charities to inform the Charities Regulator of &ldquo;significant events&rdquo;, where &ldquo;significant&rdquo; is not sufficiently defined, which have or might in future negatively impact the charity.  Fourth, the impact of the perceived or felt increase in the responsibilities of charities trustees, accepting that the proposed definition of the duties of charities trustees merely codifies what is already there in common law, the perceived focusing of responsibility on individual charities trustees rather than on the body corporate or the board collectively and the effect these perceptions may have on deterring people from volunteering to be trustees.  Fifth, the unworkable requirement for any change, however minor, to a charity&rsquo;s constitution to be approved in advance by the Charities Regulator.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Murphy will provide a summary of these provisions and others.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivan Cooper"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I turn to a summary of the legal submission.  In the legal section of the written submission to committee, Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran outlined legal amendments which could be considered to address the major policy issues flagged by the other speakers, as well as a series of stand-alone legal issues which were apparent from our review of the Bill and which are capable of being addressed in subsequent drafting of the Bill.<\/p> <p>  I turn to a number of heads of the Bill which the committee may view as relevant to our appearance.  Head 5 introduces discretionary reporting of suspected charity law offences.  We envisage that problems could arise if the regulator is not obligated to share information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na indicating a criminal act or breach of law.  We suggest that a positive obligation should be imposed on the Charities Regulator to share information with the appropriate authorities where a suspected offence has occurred.  <\/p> <p>  On head 7, this proposed amendment inserts a legal obligation that a charity shall not amend its constitution without the prior approval of the Charities Regulator.  We are concerned that this provision is not proportionate as it requires the prior approval of the Charities Regulator for any change to a charity&rsquo;s constitution, however minor or inconsequential.  It would be unworkable in practice and reflects a significant extension of the regulator&rsquo;s statutory powers in terms of how charities define themselves.  <\/p> <p>  Head 8 grants the Charities Regulator powers to make changes to the information on the charities register without consulting the charitable organisation in question.  As it stands, this head would not provide charity trustees with an opportunity to comment on, object to or agree to the changes to the register.  We believe that the regulator should engage with charity trustees in relation to any change and afford them the opportunity to make the change.  <\/p> <p>  Head 9 streamlines the process of removing charities from the register and establishes the power of the Charities Regulator, rather than the High Court, as the first adjudicator.  Removal from the register is an extraordinarily serious sanction with far-reaching consequences.  Charities are only permitted to operate in Ireland if they are on the register.  This head removes several important steps in deregistering a charity and could lead to a sudden shutdown of public services, immediate loss of jobs and the suspension of all financial transactions and board status for a charity which suffers a deregistration.  <\/p> <p>  Head 23 introduces an obligation for charity trustees to notify the Charities Regulator as soon as practicable where there are reasonable grounds to believe a significant event has occurred or is likely to occur.  We have concerns about the definition proposed for \"significant event\".  This head creates a circumstance where trustees could be retrospectively held accountable for not reporting something later determined by the regulator to be significant.  This will place a disproportionate burden on charity trustees who must decide in the abstract whether a potential set of circumstances qualifies as a serious incident.  This may become one of several administrative burdens placed on the regulator, as concerned boards may report on all manner of possible &ldquo;significant events&rdquo; in their need to comply, thus overwhelming the regulator's capacity.  <\/p> <p>  Head 24 relates to directions arising from an inspector&rsquo;s report and a new offence of failure to comply with a direction.  This head gives the regulator significant discretionary power, including power to deregister a charity without input or submission from that charity.  We recommend this provision be amended to facilitate engagement by the Charities Regulator with the charity, prior to any decision on removal.  <\/p> <p>  Head 29 addresses payments made to charity trustees other than for fulfilling their role as trustees.  Certain charities have provisions in their constitution that permit or oblige, for instance, the CEO to be a charity trustee.  Additionally, the proposal to require advance approval for any arrangement between a charity trustee or any person connected to that trustee relies on a very broad and potentially inappropriate definition.  There will be circumstances in which it is good governance practice, and represents the best outcome for the charity, to enter into an arrangement with a trustee.  Many such arrangements are already in place and no provision is made for this reality in the Bill.

Many Irish charities are small and governed and led by volunteers.  Many have limited access to legal advice.  We need a system of regulation that works for all charities and a regulatory framework that provides absolute clarity as to the legal obligations applicable to charity trustees.  Let us remember that, above all, charity trusteeship is a public service and often not acknowledged, understood or valued.  Trustees are the guardians of charity, and trusteeship requires personal sacrifice.  It means people giving time and energy that might otherwise be invested in their careers or spent with their families and friends in serving their charities and the people they support.  Without competent, skilled and committed trustees, the charity sector cannot function.  We advocate a fair and balanced regulatory system which will be equally robust and supportive, protecting and promoting the compliant charities and taking swift action against unregulated intentional wrongdoers or the grossly negligent.<\/p><p> We appreciate this opportunity to engage with the joint committee on developing this important legislation for our sector, which provides such vital services, supports and employment across Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivan Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1083,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive and well-laid-out opening statement.

Their opening statement was comprehensive.  Their written submission is extremely detailed.  I thank Mr. Cooper and members of the Wheel for talking me through that submission.  It is comprehensive, and it was brilliant to have that opportunity to talk it through with them in order to really understand the implications of this.  Even though there are quite a few criticisms of the general scheme in what the witnesses have submitted to us, I know they are positively disposed towards it.  That bears saying.  We all recognise the need for updated legislation in this area.  We are trying to go in the right direction with this proposed Bill.  It is about making charities easier to function, but with an appropriate level of oversight.  In addition, this shows the importance of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, whereby we have an opportunity to have these discussions before general schemes are turned into legislation, before they enter into that pipeline where it becomes much more difficult to shape the legislation.  All those things bear saying from the outset.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on a number of matters in order to allow the witnesses to bring their points out in more detail.  What really comes across to me is that in a lot of cases here a sledgehammer is being used to crack a walnut.  It seems like there has been an overpowering of the regulator in some cases to answer a problem that is there and, in other cases, to answer a problem I am not sure is there.  One example of that was the idea of the transfer of powers to the High Court and that being moved back to the regulator, which is provided for in head 9, relating to section 43 of the Act of 2009.  When we discussed this it became clear there is not a huge workload being generated by the High Court that this provision seeks to answer.  Therefore, the question must be asked, why do we need to do away with this provision?  It occurred to me that if the Bill were passed in its current format, mischievous charities might make numerous amendments to their constitutions and submit them to the regulator.  They might foresee numerous significant events, and if all the charities in Ireland were to foresee numerous significant events and to make numerous minor changes to their constitutions, I think quite a job of work would be created within the new regulator.<\/p> <p>  Two of the most important things that jumped out at me were head 9, relating to section 43 of the Act of 2009, and head 8, relating to section 40 of the Act.  They are about the ability to delist a charity.  There is no sense of a graduated response here.  It is like we go straight to a nuclear deterrent.  If a charity is removed from the register, that is it, essentially.  The curtains are closed and you go home.  I do not see the steps leading up to that or see within the proposed Bill a sufficient requirement to engage with the charity before that deterrent is put in place.  Then I do not see an appeals process whereby if a charity feels that it has been unfairly dealt with, it would have some sort of recourse.  That is one of the central things that jumped out at me from the witnesses' submissions.  In addition, there is the requirement to disclose information on a significant event, which is crystal ball gazing from anybody involved in a charity.  Significant events should be identified and acted on, and charities should feel like they can go to their regulator and say they think there is a problem coming down the line and ask for help with it.  As currently constituted, however, the general scheme provides that you are supposed to look into a crystal ball and, by God, if you miss something you are on the hook for it.  I do not know if that will help charities to view the regulator as a resource that can help them and something they can rely on.<\/p> <p>  I could draw on many more issues raised in the witnesses' written submission, but if we may start with those, I invite the witnesses to comment on those specific provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#C00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>Those are two of the principal and major concerns we have outlined.  With regard to the deregistration of charities, there is a chilling effect for many organisations to think that the latter could occur in the space of 24 hours.  I am not for one instance suggesting that this is the type of action the Charities Regulator would take, but the proposed Bill - or the Act, if the general scheme in its current format were to be passed - would mean that the regulator could do that.  I do not think it is thought through on the basis, as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh rightly said, of the sequential actions that occur from that because the curtain is pulled down and we have a situation of completely frozen assets, employment termination and services termination because as soon as the charity is deregistered it cannot carry out any business whatsoever.  It is therefore no longer really a functional entity.  The committee can imagine the amount of public funding that may have already been provided to that charity, the people who rely on its services and the employees working for it.  As a result, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh that this is one of the major aspects of the general scheme that require further legislative scrutiny before its introduction.<\/p> <p>  The significant events, as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh rightly said, are not determined or outlined in the general scheme.  In addition, because the sector is as diverse as it is, what is a significant event for a charity with a turnover of over &euro;10 million is very different from a significant event for a charity with a turnover of &euro;100,000.  In essence, one of the things we seek in the proportionality, the balance and the fairness we are looking for from regulation is that support from the regulator to advise in all these instances what would constitute a significant event.  That will be different depending on the nature of the service and depending on the scale of the enterprise being undertaken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has raised some key points about the ability to delist charities, the reporting of significant events, which Ms Myler has spoken to, and using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  In summary, and in general, the thrust of our submission is about the requirement to ensure that the regulatory regime enhances and supports a culture of support for charities rather than a culture which appears to be facilitated by this or by certain provisions in this general scheme, which seems to have to do with empowering the regulator to take action against charities rather than working and discussing with charities to arrive at productive solutions to the challenges the sector and individual organisations face.  We really do not want a culture of fear coming to predominate where trustees feel themselves subject to the power of the regulator.  The important controls currently in place regarding having to go to the High Court, for example, and regarding decisions to delist were carefully put in place when the original Charities Act was enacted.<\/p><p>They were there because it recognises that the system depends on the willingness of trustees to put their own reputations at stake as well when they step forward to do this public service.  We do not really understand where the problem is with the current regime in regard to the powers the regulator already has, which are very significant, and why the need is felt to move so quickly to these powers of delisting or deregistering charities from the regulator.  It almost as though, as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh alluded to, the regulator will be empowered to move to having the ability to deregister a charity without having to go through vital steps of due process that we believe are there.<\/p><p> In a general summary, the points have been captured well and Ms Myler elaborated on a couple of them.  The main observation we would make is that it appears this legislation is moving, in a kind of unwarranted way, towards giving the regulator even more discretionary powers than it has.  That will result in trustees and charities feeling themselves - this is about feeling - to be potentially subject to fairly unlimited powers that I think would lead, in any constitutional circumstance, a reasonable person to say it is an awful lot of power to give an agency, entity or regulator over important organisations, especially when they are dependent on people being willing to come forward voluntarily and do this important work for us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivan Cooper","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1088,"content":"<p>I will not restate the opinions of the other speakers, with which I agree.  Nevertheless, as a charity lawyer, coming at this strictly from a legal perspective, the removal from the register, as drafted within the legislation, requires no reasons for a removal.  From a legislative robustness perspective, at the very least, inserting a requirement for reasons would be helpful.  Taking a forensic look at the long list that currently applies whereby removal can be invoked as a sanction, we can clearly see some offences that are disproportionate to the sanction of removal.  There is an offence of refusing or neglecting to ask the Charities Regulator whether a charity may make a change to its name.  Many charities make changes to their name each year.  At the moment, as drafted, our legislation provides for an automatic removal from the register for a charity that fails to seek approval for its name change.  It is our view at Mason Hayes &amp;amp; Curran that the full list of events that can result in removal ought to be scrutinised, that only events that are proportionate to the sanction should be included at all, and that a process backed up by an obligation to provide for good reasons should be instituted.<\/p> <p>  I might comment briefly on the provision relating to &ldquo;significant events&rdquo;.  Efforts have been made in the Bill to define the phrase \"significant events\" but three quite general definitions are given, including loss of property and, even more broadly, something that may have a reputational risk for the charity.  We had some concerns about the broad nature of those definitions.  I am sure work could be done to specify what type of event is a significant event.  Having conducted some comparative analysis with similar legislative regimes in charity law, we noticed that generally in other jurisdictions, the obligation to report a significant event is put into guidance from the regulator.  From a policy perspective, one might think guidance from the regulator, which can be easily amended over time, might be a more appropriate home for this obligation of reporting a significant event rather than primary legislation, which is so difficult to amend.  Furthermore, in the other jurisdictions, the requirement is not retrospective and charity trustees are not required to make a compulsory report on something that might occur in the future.  From a legal certainty perspective, that is very difficult and certainly quite chilling.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1089,"content":"<p>You would be terrified to open your mouth at a board meeting because it would be minuted and you would then be obligated, no matter what the concern you raised was, to report it.

If something is not reported that may be coming down the line, the regulator could conceivably be in a position to determine <i>post hoc<\/i>that it was a significant event that should have been reported to it.  When trustees are making decisions, they will say they cannot take a chance on something that could be significant and, therefore, will report it.  That will add to this general culture of suspicion and worry among trustees.<br\/><br\/>Finally, while there is not a direct connection between the two provisions, there is something else worth observing here.  As Ms Murphy noted, a provision will remove the requirement for the regulator to report to the Garda what it suspects might be an offence under the Charities Act.  One way of understanding that might be that it will remove from the regulator a requirement to report a significant event to the Garda, yet at the same time, and in the same legislation, the regulator will be given a power to insist that charities report to it significant events that may or may not occur.  There is a sense there will be a diminution of the extent to which the regulator itself will arguably be accountable or connected to the system while, at the same time, the requirement on charities to report significant events to it will be increased.  It is worth understanding that, fundamentally, this is probably the most worrying aspect of the draft legislation, as it stands.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#D00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivan Cooper"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1092,"content":"<p>Mr. Cooper made a point about significant events and the culture that provision will create at board level in regard to suspicion and worry.

What will be the practical reality of that?  If individual board members are reporting issues to the charity regulator, it will create within any board an issue of suspicion and worry.

A chilling effect is one way of understanding it.  Board decisions are minuted.  Many have argued, under freedom of information, FOI, provisions, for example, that the quality of discussion and record-keeping has been negatively impacted in some respects in the context of FOI and how that operates.  What is and is not significant is an important consideration in this regard.  If there is a sense that the outcome of the conversation may be that what we thought is not significant and will be recorded in minutes as a conservation having taken place about something, which then is not reported, that may have a back-up effect whereby people will be unwilling to raise an issue for fear of the fact there will have to be a discussion about it, which will be minuted in due course and so on.<\/p> <p>  We feel that to protect against that, given trustees behave in ways that have to do with high levels of integrity, the logic is that all these discussions will, in fact, take place, but that the more likely outcome is that organisations will feel they will have to report.<\/p><p>Rather than suppressing interaction at boards, we feel that the more likely outcome would be an over-reporting.  This is probably what will come out of it.  Associated with that over-reporting will be worry and alarm.  This is the issue.  This is how it will manifest.  It will manifest in the hearts and minds of trustees about the fact that they have to report something to the regulator, for which there may now be consequences because they would not be willing to take the risk of not reporting something, which then subsequently turns out to be significant.<\/p><p> Under the legislation in the UK there is an obligation to report serious incidents, which is past tense and stuff that has happened and not stuff that may happen or will happen.

I believe that this is going to become a very significant part of what the risk register is going to look like for our organisation.  We will probably spend most of our board meetings talking about what could be or was or possibly will be, a significant event if the definition is not properly captured in any legislation that we pass.<\/p> <p>  Another aspect we have brought out in our submission is the time spent on governance and, obviously, the cost of governance.  My board would probably suggest that we seek some legal definition on this and some legal advice on this.

I completely agree with the scenario that Mr. Cooper has built beforehand.  I do not relish a board meeting where, in fact, I am going to spend most of it either managing or talking about hypotheticals.

It is very helpful to get that deeper understanding of where the charities are coming from.<\/p> <p>  There are three words: it must be transparent, fair and proportionate.  If we can get those right it will be a really good Bill.  That is what we are working towards.  This really helps to get that stage.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in boards and have been involved in boards for many years.  If boards are to spend their time thinking about what could possibly happen as a significant event that we would have to report, it would just cripple the boards, it would cripple conversation and cripple the agendas because boards would literally just be talking about what could potentially happen in the future that board members are personally responsible for.  People go onto boards and get involved in community organisations because they want to help and to support their communities, whatever their interest may be.<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the name change scenario.  We were only chatting about this yesterday.  I am on the board of a community drug team.  We have changed our name from a local organisation to being the Dublin 15 Community Drugs Team.  For us that was a really simple thing to do because we had been asked by the HSE to broaden the area that we cover.  If we had the conversation about this, about what the implication would be if we changed our name, we would have to report that.  It is just a simple thing where one agency is telling us that we must do this because now we are covering a bigger area, but the Charities Regulator could possibly sanction us for changing the name because we did not tell them.<\/p> <p>  There is a lot of good stuff in the legislation but I believe there needs to be a series of amendments to it.  The point about the hammer cracking the nut is a very important one.  We must understand that while there are very large organisations with huge resources, their own legal teams, chief executive officers and chief financial officers, then there are organisations like ourselves that have a co-ordinator.  That person must manage staff.  He or she must manage budgets and the board, get ready for board meetings, and do the day-to-day stuff, including clinical supervision.  There is a list of things that this person has to do.  If we overburden this person with more and more regulation, the chilling effect would have a real impact on trying to encourage people to come into the community and voluntary sector.  This is from an employee perspective.  It would be even more difficult, and it is more difficult, from a board of management perspective when one is trying to encourage people to get involved in boards.<\/p> <p>  I am involved in the compliance and governance part of the board.  There are reams and reams of documents involving, for example, the HSE and Tusla.  It is endless.  There could be 30 or 40 documents that one must then present as part of the service level agreement at the end of the year, for example to the HSE, if the funding is from the HSE.  The organisation must go through all of those and all of the staff must understand them.  It is fine: I understand that this is part of the environment and all of those are there because of learned experiences and because something has happened, which means that we must put this sort of compliance in place.  We must, however, be very careful that we do it in a way that is supportive and so it is not something that is going to put people off.  This is very important.<\/p> <p>  A lot of the stuff I wanted to talk about has been covered and I will not go over it again.  There is one aspect that I find a little bit difficult, which is head 29 and personally connected people.  For me this is a difficult one.  I can understand where it is coming from because in the context of charities, you do not want nepotism going around or the giving of contracts to people in a process that may not be as open and transparent as it possibly could be.  We need to tease that aspect out.  I am still a little fuzzy about that part.

There is already a section 89 of the Charities Act on the Statute Book, but because this is a very vexed issue it was never enacted and never commenced.  The legislators, the regulator, advisers and policy experts have all given a lot of thought to this.  The new section 89 runs to some 20 subsections, so it is really trying to deal with an awful lot.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that this is a tricky matter in governance terms.  As was mentioned at the outset, in a forum like this we invariably focus on the thorny issues.  That is not to say that the concepts and the principles of section 89 are anything but quite correct, good and positive.<\/p> <p>  In the way the section has been drafted, we do collectively have some worries.  Our first worry centres around the fact that as currently presented, the new section 89 requires an advanced approval for any circumstance in which someone who was on the board is being paid by the charity, even where they are being paid not for sitting as a trustee but for something else that they do for the charity.  There is what we would term a \"clean slate\" approach taken where the section is written as if no charity in the country has anyone on the board who was also doing something else for that charity.  Therefore, the way it is written says that if an organisation would ever wish for that to be the case in their charity, first they must go to the regulator to seek advance permission.<\/p><p> This is the biggest issue.  Throughout the third level education sector, healthcare and many other sectors, we have people on the boards of charities who are employees of those charities and work in them or people who have some class of an arrangement with the charities.  We always use the fictional example of someone owning the photocopying company that leases the photocopier to the charity.  Two categories of arrangements already exist.  The first category is very straightforward whereby the CEO is also on the board.  In some cases legislation requires this, particularly in education.  It is premised on there being executive and non-executive board members.  To take such an institution, if the Bill as drafted is introduced, this will no longer be permitted and the charity will have to go to the regulator for advance approval.  There is no clean slate.  Imagining this does not already exist is a drafting problem.  It exists and we cannot have large charitable organisations stymied on day one of the legislation with their CEOs not knowing whether they can attend the meetings.  They must do so under one Act while the new legislation states they cannot do so.  This is quite a big worry.<\/p><p> Other provisions we believe are suboptimal arise in other subsections.  The notion of a link was mentioned by the Deputy.  The definition of the personal connection is very broad.  We all understand why, generally, good governance practice might suggest that contracts for big expenditure are not given to someone on the board.  This is very well understood.  In large measure charities in this country are run on a shoestring.  There are circumstances where, for example, a builder on a board will say a job will be done at cost while other builders could not do this and it would cost three times as much.  To follow this fictional example, if the building is falling down and the charity desperately needs to rebuild it for its vulnerable service users, waiting for advanced approval from the regulator would be fine if the process is swift.  The regulator's resources are limited and routine applications of this nature in other areas can take three to six months.  We can see the problems this could cause.<\/p><p> Another worry we have about this section is that the definition of a personal connection is especially broad.  If somebody sitting on the board has another business with a business partner in another field entirely, we could find that the charity could not procure a service based on the definition as it is at present.  I regard these issues as more technical.  The principal concern we have is the issue of a slam dunk date when all of sudden we find that charities throughout the country are in breach of the law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1099,"content":"<p>I want to turn to a broader issue.  I have had plenty of personal experience of dealing with regulators.  In general, among regulators in this country there has very much been an ethos of a top-down and directional approach rather than engaging in an advisory approach.  This is across the board with regard to regulators in the country.  The culture has been very much about compliance with the law rather than assisting the organisations being regulated and facilitating them in complying with the law.  While this is all well and good in terms of regulating corporate bodies, and we have had plenty of instances where corporate bodies immediately challenge a decision through the courts to prolong the process, community organisations and family-run businesses do not have these resources and end up in situations where they have been forced to close because of the lack of engagement and the culture that exists.<\/p> <p>  My next question is more from Ms Murphy than anyone else but I invite the other witnesses to come in on it if they wish.  Ms Murphy has reviewed the experience of regulators in other jurisdictions from a legislative approach.  With regard to a culture approach, did she come across an example of a regulator that has been more co-operative and acted in a more supportive role rather than in a policing and enforcement role?  Is there a good example or template we could use?  Sadly, we do not have a good example here in this country.  My experience over the years in this jurisdiction is that regulation operates through fear.  This is across the board in all of the sectors of which I have had experience.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#F00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1100,"content":"<p>Charity regulation in Ireland is reasonably young and new.  Historically, those of us involved in charities going back a long time remember when the Revenue Commissioners used to set some rules.  A proper statutory framework for the regulation of charities only came in with the Charities Act 2009, which was only brought into law on 16 October 2014.  We have approximately eight years of charity regulation here.  I believe our regulator has leaned on the older legislative regimes in common law jurisdictions.  We often look to the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.<\/p> <p>  With regard to a friendly, supportive and meaningful regulatory framework that is of assistance to charities in keeping themselves going, the presence of guidance is very useful in addition to primary legislation.  It is my view that primary legislation can only go so far in tackling what the Chair is speaking about with regard to the approach.  We will never nail culture and approach in primary legislation.  We can go an awful lot further in the establishment of a supportive framework through soft law instruments such as guidance.  An example is the regulator's website stating a charity can come to it.  The Scottish regulator does well on this front.  The Charity Commission for England and Wales is an equally good benchmark with a more established regime.<\/p> <p>  Our regulator has gone a huge way in the past two or three years in the production of guidance to help trustees.  I would venture to suggest that whether a given regulator operates as a police officer or as a supportive oversight body will probably not come down to the words on the page of the Act.  Naturally, we adopt Deputy Donnelly's transparent, fair and proportionate approach.  In a review of the legislation, we should certainly remove provisions that are clearly disproportionate and clearly unreasonable.  With the best will in the world, in the development of the legislative framework, we must rely on the regulator and the office of the regulator to take the legislation and interpret it in a fair and supportive way rather than taking the legislation and deciding it now has three powers and coming down hard on every minor issue that comes on the desk.  It has to be led by the regulator's office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alice Murphy"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>I am on a State board that delivers regulation.  I agree entirely with Ms Murphy.  The culture and approach is often set on the board of the statutory body.  The question is whether the resources face towards compliance or towards guidance, protection and promotion.  The primary legislation has a role to play in delivering the balance and transparency.  There is an opportunity to provide positive obligations on a regulator in the legislation.  As we redraft the legislation, we have an opportunity that we welcome.  There is always the question of resources to deliver these actions.  The tone and culture is set at the board of the regulatory body.<\/p><p>Very recently we, along with The Wheel, and other organisational entities operating in the charity sector, had a very good discussion with the regulator about setting up a stakeholder forum.  We believe this will deliver part of that feedback from the sector to the regulator, and the interaction that is required to create this culture of transparency and accountability, and for us to be the watchdogs on behalf of the regulator for trends that are occurring in the sector.  We are really looking forward to its establishment, and we hope to be able to feed into it too.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Ms &Aacute;ine Myler","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>We will move on to Mr. Cooper.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#G00200","speaker":"1603"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1663714800,"counter":1104,"content":"<p>I would like to tie a few of those contributions together.  We fully support regulation in the public interest, and have no issue with regulation <i>per se<\/i>, but it is all about the nature and approach of the regulation.  The regulator has an obligation and its primary objective is to increase public trust and confidence in charities.  That requires a balance.  There is an element of holding to account and setting and ensuring standards, and that is what this hard piece is about in relation to the legislation, but there is a piece to which the Chair has alluded in relation to supporting organisations.  That is very important as a component.  There is also a worry that in the background to the proposals we have on the table here, there might be a sense of the clich&eacute; that hard cases make bad law.  Therefore, what is going on here, although unsaid, is that the regulator is making up for the fact that it perhaps felt it did not have sufficient power at a specific point to deal with a handful of hard cases that are unlikely to occur in any kind of similar way again, especially as the sector has been culturally adjusting to the standards that are now there in relation to charity regulation and governance.  It would appear that the balance in this draft legislation is wrong at the moment.  There is too much emphasis on giving the regulator more powers.  It is almost like the regulator will become ever present in the mind of trustees when going about their daily business, to an extent that will cause worry and fear, and a reluctance to become involved.  We just need to be really careful in relation to how we move from here.<br\/><br\/>The Cathaoirleach captured it very well.  We do not believe there is anything that fundamentally prevents the regulator from taking a more supportive approach, if that is what it chooses to do, and we would encourage it to do so.  Ms Murphy mentioned a debate when the original charities Act came in as to whether the regulator would be a policeman or a pal.  However, being either completely will not work.  The art of the regulator is to be both policeman and pal.  We think it is possible in relation to this draft legislation to make the amendments we are suggesting to get a better balance.  Legislation or law determines culture.  Culture can often result from that.  Structures and processes determine the way we do things around here so it is really important that we get that right.<br\/><br\/>I will make a final observation.  There is this reality that applies across other regulatory regimes, where authorities and powers attempt to shift risk away from themselves in all circumstances.  It is a process of general risk shifting.  I am sure members are all aware of difficulties in the insurance market at the moment and the problems many organisations are having finding insurance.  It is the same culture of risk shifting that prevails.  How that manifests fundamentally is that if regulators are unwilling to share a degree of the risk on behalf of the sectors they are regulating, then services are removed or disappear.  Fundamentally, it is individuals, families and members of communities who are reliant and depend on the services provided by charities governed by trustees who will suffer if we find people walking away and if charities have to invest disproportionate amounts of times and energy in over-focusing on eliminating risk, which cannot be done.  We all know that risks cannot be eliminated.  We need to have a risk appetite, and trustees cannot be punished for determining that there are risks that they wish to take, which they do not have to report as significant potential events to the regulator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2022092100002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ivan Cooper"},{"type":"speech","time":1663714800,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Cooper.  You are correct that it is important that we get a balance here.  There has been a handful of bad eggs and a handful of very high profile cases.  However, as Ms Myler, pointed out, this legislation has only been implemented for the last eight years.  In particular in the charities sector, much of the financial side of it has been in abeyance for the last couple of years because of Covid-19.  We are talking about a very narrow window of application for this legislation.  One of the key questions here is whether the bad eggs we have seen over the last couple of years are an overhang from the lack of regulation up to now or as a result of weak regulation that we currently have in place.  That is something the committee is going to have to tease out both in terms of the general scheme before us and the legislation when it comes before us later in the year.<\/p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the evidence they have provided this morning, and for their engagement with colleagues over the last number of weeks and more particularly for the detailed submission they have provided.  This is very helpful as guidance to the committee in terms of us coming to a conclusion with regard to the pre-legislative scrutiny, but also in terms of informing us in advance of the legislation itself coming forward.  Witnesses should feel free to come back and engage with the committee, and bring back further issues of concern they have at the stage of pre-legislative scrutiny, and after the legislation itself has been published.  It will assist individual committee members and the committee as a whole in ensuring what we all want, which is robust legislation that ensures we have a strong vibrant charity sector in this country into the future and that we have legislation that stands the test of time.
