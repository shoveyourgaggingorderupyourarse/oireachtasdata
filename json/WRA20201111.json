This is informing design solutions for provision of the fibre network. This detailed design is then used to initiate the &lsquo;make ready&rsquo; project with eir for the area, where eir ensure any poles and ducts being reused are fit for purpose. It is also used to initiate works with the subcontractors deploying the actual fibre in the area.<\/p><p>The first fibre to the home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, Co Cork\u00a0and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to a wider release of the area. I am advised that from the end of January retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in this area will be able to order high speed broadband provided via the NBI network.<\/p><p>Further details are available on specific areas within\u00a0Clare through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises when works are due to commence. <\/p><p>  Broadband Connection Points (BCPs) are a key element of the NBP providing high speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll out of the fibre to the home network. As of 30 October, 187 sites have been installed by NBI and the high speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites and by the Department of Education and Skills for schools.

To realise the enormous potential of the offshore energy sector while ensuring a just transition will require fully coordinated support across civic society and government, from public acceptance, research and development, through supply chain development, to commercial deployment. The environmental and other impacts of offshore renewables must be managed in line with international obligations and best practice to support maximum social acceptance. Offshore wind energy projects are subject to several legislative and consenting considerations, which must be satisfied for a site to progress through planning and development, construction and commissioning.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage \u00a0on the development of the Marine Planning and Development Management Bill which will provide a modern, up-to-date regulatory and marine planning framework for offshore renewable energy developments. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is also in the process of finalising Ireland&rsquo;s first marine spatial plan, the National Marine Planning Framework. The Department has been guided by a Marine Spatial Planning Advisory Group throughout this process, chaired by the Minister for State, and made up of a large number of stakeholders representing social, economic and environment groups, including fisheries representatives, as well as relevant public sector organisations.

As public transport is responsible for less than 5% of our transport emissions, in absolute terms, converting public transport fleets to low carbon alternatives will have a very limited impact on national emission reductions; however, it does fulfil a strong leadership role as we shift towards a low-carbon economy. To this end, I am committed to continuing to green the public transport fleet and to making each public transport journey less carbon intensive. A comprehensive programme of work is already underway and there is a clear vision to move towards zero emitting vehicles where and when possible.<\/p><p>The national bus fleet, that carries the majority of public transport passengers, is already moving to lower emitting alternatives. This year 100 hybrid buses were ordered for the urban PSO bus fleets while over 200 hybrid buses will be ordered next year, while in 2021 the NTA also expects to introduce a fully electric town service fleet. This week I was glad to launch Phase 2 of the <i>Low Emission Bus Trial<\/i>, which over the coming months, will assess the performance and operation of both hydrogen and electric buses and will help inform the overall conversion of our fleet to lower emitting alternatives by 2030. Understanding the various fueling technologies available is key to making well informed future bus procurement decisions. Beyond urban services, my Department is also funding a number of electric vehicle pilot projects in rural areas under the Local Link programme. <\/p><p>In terms of heavy rail, in 2021, we&rsquo;re looking to expand electrification through the DART+ programme which will ultimately mean around 70% of journeys in any given year on the rail network will be on electrified services, while in the interim we&rsquo;re continuing to expand rail capacity through the ongoing construction of the National Train Control Centre and 41 additional carriages for the Greater Dublin Area commuter rail fleet. I also intend to commission a review of the rail network which will consider the potential for high\/higher - speed rail, including, of course, the potential electrification of the inter-urban network.<\/p><p>As regards our light rail network,<b><\/b>we are currently expanding the capacity of the Luas Green Line with the ongoing arrival of 26 tram extensions and 8 new additional trams which I expect will have entered service by Q2 2021. We will also look at route options for Luas Cork, Luas Lucan and the preliminary design for Luas Finglas. Next year I also intend to seek Government&rsquo;s approval in relation to MetroLink, a new largely underground electrified metro service in Dublin, and likely the largest public investment project in the history of the State.<\/p><p>Furthermore, in the recent Budget I was delighted to announce an EV scrappage scheme to enhance the supports available for taxi and hackney drivers switching to electric vehicles.

As the Deputy is aware, I am fully committed to increasing modal shift towards public transport and active travel as a means of decreasing transport emissions. We&rsquo;ve seen some really good additions to active travel infrastructure and our public realm in recent months as Local Authorities across the country have put in place emergency measures to support local communities and businesses through our current difficulties.

The cost of the scheme in 2019, excluding motor tax, was &euro;72m. <\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief an organisation must be entered in the register of charitable organisations under Part 3 of the Charities Act 2009, be engaged in the transport of disabled persons and whose purpose is to provide services to persons with disabilities.<\/p><p>In order to qualify for relief the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate (PMC) issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate (BMC) issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other criteria apply in relation to the vehicle and its use, including that the vehicle must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant.<\/p><p>The terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 set out the following medical criteria, and that one or more of these criteria is required to be satisfied in order to obtain a PMC:<\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; <\/p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; <\/p><p>- be without one or both legs; <\/p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; <\/p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have  serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.  <\/p><p>A Supreme Court decision of 18<sup>th<\/sup>June found in favour of two appellants against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal's refusal to grant them a PMC. The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons. <\/p><p>The Deputies will appreciate that the complex legal and policy issues raised by the Supreme Court decision will require careful consideration. In parallel to that consideration there is a need to examine how best the Scheme can target resources to those persons who most need them. I am currently giving consideration to policy and legislative proposals set out by my officials and will seek to progress this issue in the coming weeks.  <\/p><p>In the interim, on foot of the legal advice received, it became clear that it was appropriate to revisit the six medical criteria set out in Regulation 3 of Statutory Instrument 353 of 1994 for these assessments. In such circumstances, it is not proposed to continue with PMC assessments until a revised basis for such assessments is established. The medical officers who are responsible for conducting PMC assessments need to have assurance that the decisions they make are based on clear criteria set out in legislation.

The measures included flexible loan repayment arrangements where needed, including loan payment breaks initially for a period up to three months and then subsequently extended for up to six months. This was a welcome initiative and it allowed necessary relief to be quickly and efficiently provided to borrowers.<\/p><p>Banks have now provided for flexible options for borrowers who can recommence payments following a Covid-19 payment break, and the BPFI has produced a useful guide on this - .  <\/p><p>However, I am very conscious that many borrowers continue to be impacted by the economic consequences of Covid-19, and that they may not be in a position to resume their loan repayment commitments when their payment break ends or may be in difficulty now for the first time.  I am fully aware of the stress and uncertainty that these borrowers are facing, and they will continue to need assistance and support from their lenders.  As the Deputy will know, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I met the CEOs of the country&rsquo;s retail banks and the Banking Payments Federation Ireland on 28 September to discuss this matter and we indicated that it is particularly vital that lenders work with their customers to ensure that suitable arrangements are put in place to assist their customers who are still experiencing difficulty. The lenders indicated that they will ensure that customers who have difficulties in meeting their loan repayments will be supported with a range of options so that a suitable arrangement can be agreed.  <\/p><p>Borrowers have a suite of regulatory protections, such as the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, and lenders have specific obligations to support and work with borrowers who are continuing to experience mortgage or other loan difficulty because of Covid-19. These options could include additional flexibility, and this could be a short term arrangement such as additional periods without payments or interest-only repayments, or if appropriate more long term arrangements. The Central Bank has confirmed that there is no regulatory impediment to lenders offering payment breaks to borrowers, providing they are appropriate for the individual borrower circumstance. Each individual&rsquo;s position is different and that&rsquo;s why a case-by-case approach is now the best approach as some sectors of the economy are more impacted than others.<\/p><p>I will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the Central Bank consumer protection framework will be fully available to mortgage and other borrowers that will still need support due to the economic impact of Covid-19.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100073#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":125,"qnumday":67,"qnumall":"[35493\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100073#WRC05700","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the assistance that can be offered to a business (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1493","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":126,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[35573\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100073#WRC05800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will review a matter (details supplied) regarding the Covid-19 restrictions support scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1616","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":127,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 71 together.<\/p><p>The details of the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) are set out in the Finance Bill 2020 and guidelines on the operation of the scheme are available on the Revenue website ().

It continues to monitor all firms through intrusive and robust supervision, challenging boards and executive management. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank intervenes, within the scope of its regulatory mandate, to ensure the interests of consumers are protected by focusing on the issues, which pose the greatest potential or actual risk of consumer harm. Its targeted interventions are aimed at addressing widespread issues that affect many customers.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to enforcement actions such as Administrative Sanctions, the Central Bank uses a wide range of other tools to take action against regulated entities, which fall short of its expected standards of behaviour. These include ensuring that firms and individuals seeking to access the market meet high regulatory standards, requiring firms to have robust risk management processes in place to address all risks to consumers, directing firms to put things right when they have made errors or caused consumer harm and making sure firms compensate consumers for losses due to misconduct.<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has assured me that it will not shy away from undertaking robust and intrusive enforcement investigations where necessary if firms fail to reach the expected standards and their actions pose a risk to consumers.<\/p>  <p>  The Tracker Mortgage Examination (the &ldquo;TME&rdquo;) was the largest and most complex piece of supervisory work and remediation scheme ever undertaken by the Central Bank.

The Act provides that the Central Bank can refuse to grant (or renew) a licence to a moneylender if it is of the opinion that the cost of credit is excessive.  Since assuming responsibility for the regulation of the sector in 2003, the Central Bank has not permitted the maximum APR charged within the sector to increase, nor has it allowed practices such as pay-day lending to enter the Irish licensed moneylender market.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a statutory interest rate cap.  Neither the Act nor the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 (the CCR) provide for an interest rate cap, nor does the Act define &ldquo;excessive&rdquo; in the context of interest rates. The Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market wide cap on rates. The introduction of an interest rate cap would require a legislative amendment.  Any legislative proposals in this regard would have to be careful to achieve an overall reduction in the cost of credit and ensure that it did not have unintended consequences in terms of financial exclusion.  <\/p>  <p>  In considering rates charged by licensed moneylenders on specific loans, the Central Bank seeks to find a balance between, on the one hand, the availability of credit for people who do not have access to regulated credit elsewhere or who do not use other regulated credit providers and, on the other hand, the provision of short term unsecured loans at what can be a high cost. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank&rsquo;s focus has been on improving transparency and increasing consumer awareness by way of requirements such as the need to warn consumers about the high cost nature of the loans and to disclose all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner, prior to entering into an agreement.  In addition, the Register of Moneylenders which is available to the public on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website sets out details such as the maximum APR, maximum cost of credit and the collection charge (if any) of the loans that can be offered by moneylenders.  <\/p>  <p>  There is a strong framework of protection in place for consumers who choose to avail of the services of licensed moneylenders. In addition to the protections provided under the Central Bank&rsquo;s Consumer Protection Code for Licensed Moneylenders, there are also important protections provided for in the legislation whereby licensed moneylenders are prohibited from applying additional charges (other than a collection charge) to a moneylending agreement. They are also prohibited from applying any additional charges in the event of a default in the payments due under the agreement i.e., the total amount repayable by a consumer is limited to the amount specified in the moneylending agreement the only exception being the awarding of legal costs by a Court of law.  Moneylenders are also required to undertake a creditworthiness assessment before entering into a moneylending agreement with a consumer. The Central Bank has highlighted its expectation to all credit providers, including licensed moneylenders, that they lend responsibly and act in the best interests of consumers. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, on 8 June 2020 the Central Bank published new Regulations to strengthen protections for consumers of licensed moneylending services and to enhance professional standards in the sector. The regulations include a requirement on Moneylenders to include prominent, high cost warnings in all advertisements for moneylending loans with an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) over 23 per cent. The warning must also prompt consumers to consider alternatives. The regulations will come into effect on 1 January 2021. However, recognising the financial effects of COVID-19 on consumers, the &lsquo;high-cost warning&rsquo; requirement in respect of advertisements for moneylending loans with an APR in excess of 23% came into effect on 1 September 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Where the loan is required for basic needs, such as accommodation or electricity, moneylenders must inform the consumer that a moneylending loan may not be in their best interest and provide contact information for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).   <\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Department of Finance undertook a public consultation in 2019 seeking views on capping the cost of licensed moneylenders and other regulatory matters in relation to moneylending.

These practices also cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians, and impinge on the right of children to an education.<\/p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned by an acceleration in demolitions in 2020. Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property are continuing, despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during the Covid-19 pandemic. The only conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these actions, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland regularly conveys our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU. In my statements of 16 October and 6 November, I called on Israel to halt demolitions and allow for legal construction for Palestinian residents. I have also raised the issue on my visits to the region. With regard to the villages mentioned, Irish officials have been following the issue closely. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador in Tel Aviv has directly raised the issue of demolitions with the Israeli authorities in recent weeks, along with a group of EU and non-EU colleagues. Ireland's Representative Office in Ramallah visited Masafer Yatta on 19 October and a number of other sensitive sites in recent weeks.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank. Ireland is a member of the West Bank Protection Consortium which plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and coordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid.<\/p>  <p>  It is of additional concern when those structures confiscated or demolished are donor-funded. The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education infrastructure, is contrary to Israel&rsquo;s obligations under international law, including provisions of international humanitarian law, and in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. <\/p>  <p>  While my primary concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families, it is important that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers should also be pursued. Ireland, together with a group of EU Member States, pursue this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.To date, the Consortium has sought compensation of over &euro;625,000 from the Israeli authorities in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100076#WRF00500","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100076#WRF00700"},{"type":"question","counter":251,"qnumday":111,"qnumall":"[35508\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100076#WRF00800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the breakdown of the funding allocation for his Department for 2021, by project.","asker":"1625","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":252,"content":"<p>The breakdown of the funding allocation for the Department of Foreign Affairs for 2021 is as detailed in the Estimates for Public Services 2021, published on Budget Day. <\/p>  <p>  The Department has secured a &euro;30 million increase on its 2020 allocation. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;10 million of that increase will be allocated to programmes to assist the Department in meeting the many challenges and opportunities we face in the coming year.

All of this information is reviewed by the OHS specialist occupational health physician, including the combined and cumulative risk that can arise when an employee suffers from more than one health condition.The risk categorisation is comprehensive and follows the same process that is being applied across other sectors.  An employee is categorised by the OHS into one of three COVID-19 risk categories.  These are general population risk, higher risk, and very high risk. The outcome of the risk categorisation is governed by the HSE guidance.<\/p><p>Where an employee considers the OHS &lsquo;COVID-19 Health Risk Categorisation Report&rsquo; places him\/her in an incorrect risk category, a review can be requested by the employee where the OHS will re-evaluate the medical evidence provided.

The use of face coverings and personal protective equipment may also be considered where maintaining social distancing is difficult.  All employers are required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan in place.

The revised specification was approved as a draft by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) in September 2017 before being submitted to my Department for approval.<\/p><p>The curriculum development process undertaken by the NCCA is a rigorous and collaborative process. A subject development group comprising representatives with suitable expertise, nominated by their respective stakeholder organisations, deliberate and decide, in the context of their subject, what knowledge should be acquired through study of the subject. This is then expressed as a series of learning outcomes by the subject development group. <\/p><p>The work of this specialist group is monitored and discussed regularly by the Boards and Council of the NCCA to ensure that young people in Ireland receive an appropriate, relevant, and high standard education. Throughout the process, there are several opportunities where the work of the development group is informed by public consultation. <\/p><p>This process was applied in the development of the revised Leaving Certificate Agricultural Science specification, and consensus was sought through extensive deliberation informed by relevant research, consultation and the expertise and experience of stakeholder representatives. This is evidenced by that fact that, following feedback received from the consultation on the draft curriculum specification, the NCCA&rsquo;s Agricultural Science Subject Development Group amended 43 learning outcomes to provide additional clarify, and added 8 new learning outcomes before finalising the specification.<\/p><p>Since the early 2000s, there has been a move in Ireland towards an outcomes-based approach to curriculum development, with learning being defined in terms of the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that students will have learned and developed students at the end of a course. <\/p><p>Using learning outcomes in the development of new curricula places emphasis on the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that students will learn, as well as focusing on the subject matter of the course or syllabus. They also play a significant role in ensuring that the aims and objectives of the curriculum, the learning\/teaching strategies adopted, and the assessment used are consistent with each other. <\/p><p>It should be clarified that at no point during the development of the subject specification did the NCCA, or my Department, commit to the provision of further guidance beyond what has been provided. When the work of the subject development group was concluded, the group was informed that the requirements for supporting the introduction of the specification would come into focus and that guidance in relation to coursework would be developed.

It was drawn up following consideration of the concerns of the Irish Agricultural Science Teachers Association which had been sent to the SEC, NCCA and my Department. This additional flexibility for the 2021 cohort allows all candidates to meaningfully complete their examination coursework in line with the expectations of the Brief and the Guidelines in these exceptional circumstances due to Covid-19.

Each school is required to have a COVID-19 Response Plan for the safe operation through the prevention, early detection and control of COVID-19 in line with public health advice. This guidance is focused on the practical steps schools must take to minimise the risk of transmission of infection and includes key measures such as respiratory and hand hygiene, cleaning, PPE and physical distancing.<\/p><p>In relation to physical distancing, public health advises of two broad approaches; increasing separation and decreasing interaction between students themselves, between students and staff and staff when together. HSE and HPSC guidance also advises that the application of physical distancing measures in a school should allow for some flexibility when needed and that it must be applied in a practical way, recognising that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue.<\/p><p>In order to facilitate physical distancing in primary schools, pupils and their teachers may be sorted into &lsquo;Class Bubbles&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pods&rsquo;. A &lsquo;Class Bubble&rsquo; is a class grouping which stays apart from other classes as much as possible. The objective is to limit contact and sharing of common facilities between people in different Class Bubbles (and Pods within those Class Bubbles) as much as possible, rather than to avoid all contact between Pods, as this will not always be possible.<\/p><p>Whenever possible, pupils and teaching staff should consistently be in the same Class Bubbles. Different Class Bubbles should have separate breaks and mealtimes or occupy separate areas at break or mealtimes. Movement of staff members between Class Bubbles should be limited as much as possible.<\/p><p>My Department has also published guidance for Post Primary schools on maintaining physical distance in the classroom, with illustrative classroom layouts. This guidance also includes options such as reconfiguring class spaces to maximise physical distancing, using all other space within the school, reviewing timetables and reconfiguring classes, and live streaming of a class to another room or area in the school.

These inspections are generally undertaken, twice yearly by my officials in IPAS and once yearly by QTS Limited.  Inspections cover a wide range of issues including the quality of the food, fire safety and other health and safety issues. <\/p>  <p>  Inspections were suspended temporarily during the first phase of COVID-19 restrictions but they recommenced on 14 September 2020 with all necessary safeguards in place.  During the months of September and October 33 centres were inspected.  The target is for all 45 designated accommodation centres to be inspected before the end of the year.  Emergency accommodation centres were also visited during the year.  However, such accommodation centres do not undergo the same level of inspection as the designated centres which are inspected as part of their contractual obligations. Under the current Level 5 restrictions only necessary inspections and can currently be undertaken. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from IPAS inspected the dedicated centre referred to by the Deputy on 24 September 2020 and visted the temporary centre on 27 August 2020.  There were no significant issues noted in respect of the visit to the temporary centre and the official has noted that the standard of facilities there had improved since the previous visit in December 2019.  The report of the inspection to the dedicated centre has only recently been completed and sent to the centre's management for comment prior to finalisation.  I intend to review the report of the dedicated centre and engage with IPAS about its findings and any recommendations. The report will be published shortly as are all such inspection reports.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to complaints, IPAS has a complaints procedure which is set out in the House Rules &amp;amp; Procedures Booklet for International Protection applicants.  Complaints are made initially to the centre manager with a view to informal resolution.  If the person concerned is not satisfied with the outcome of their complaint, he or she may make a complaint to IPAS who will investigate the matter and take action as appropriate.  In the event that a resident is not satisfied with how his or her complaint is dealt with, he or she has full access to the services of the Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.<\/p>  <p>  A confidential Freephone telephone support service, funded by, but independent of, my Department, was also established in May 2020 to provide further support to residents in both permanent and temporary accommodation centres. This Freephone confidential support helpline is operated by the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS). <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government contains a commitment to ending the Direct Provision system and replacing it with a new International Protection accommodation policy, centred on a not-for-profit approach.

My Department is currently developing the White Paper which I expect to publish by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  I am committed to improving standards in International Protection accommodation as the Government works to end Direct Provision.  As such my Department has also engaged with HIQA with regard to monitoring the implementation of national standards for IPAS Accommodation Centres that were published in 2019.

Investigations and inquests into the cause of a death are matters for those authorities.  We will of course act on any recommendations which may be made following completion of these processes.<\/p>  <p>   The pandemic has been difficult for our residents, as for other groups throughout Irish society.  Our priority has been to ensure the health of our residents.  To that end, we have worked closely with the HSE with regard to the public health requirements needing to be followed when we have positive or suspected cases of Covid-19 in our centres. <\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that services for protection applicants (including health services) are mainstreamed. Protection applicants are linked with primary care services (GPs), are entitled to a medical card while residing in International Protection accommodation.  Applicants access health services through the same referral pathways as Irish citizens including referral to disability and mental health services.  Every effort is made to ensure that residents' specific needs are met. Where more intensive care needs are identified such cases are referred directly to the HSE. <\/p>  <p>  If a protection applicant chooses to accept an offer of accommodation from the Department, they will, in normal circumstances, be first brought to the National Reception Centre in Balseskin, Dublin. At Balseskin, they will be offered a health assessment by the on-site Health Service Executive (HSE) team which comprises a nurse, nurse specialist, area medical officer, general practitioners (GPs), social worker and psychologist.  This ensures that applicants can be assessed for any special reception needs that they may have before they are designated an accommodation centre.  Discussions are ongoing between the relevant senior officials in my Department and the HSE to enable formal vulnerability assessments for applicants for international protection to be in place by the end of the year.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently developing a White Paper on International Protection that will set out a new model for accommodation for those seeking International Protection in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government to abolish Direct Provision.  The issue of health supports for vulnerable residents will be considered in this context.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":429,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01300"},{"type":"question","counter":430,"qnumday":173,"qnumall":"[35708\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if his Department or bodies under the aegis of his Department rent office space from a company (details supplied) or an Irish subsidiary; the number of employees who work out of such office space; the length of time they have been working from the offices; the cost to date of renting such offices; the tender process by which it was decided to make use of the services of the company; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":431,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department and bodies under its aegis do not rent office space from the named company or an Irish subsidiary.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Parental Leave","counter":432,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01600"},{"type":"question","counter":433,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[35741\/20]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2020111100079#WRJ01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"his views on matters raised in correspondence (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1581","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":434,"content":"<p>I am conscious of demands on parents at this time.

The development of sensible, comprehensive and sensitive family law procedures, particularly for vulnerable families, will be central to the new system. <\/p>  <p>  The publication of the General Scheme is a first step in an ongoing process of improving how people are able to resolve family-based problems that require a legal solution.  The overall aim is to change the culture so that the focus of the family justice system meets the complex needs of people who need help with family justice issues.<\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny.

Representatives of the fisheries sector did not favour a Storage Aid Scheme and instead called for a fleet tie-up scheme.

The Programme includes a Fisheries Local Area Development Scheme which implements a community-led local development approach to the socio-economic development of coastal communities.  Through the Scheme, seven Fisheries Local Action Groups (FLAGs) were selected in 2017 to disperse a Scheme budget of &euro;12 million.  <\/p><p>The EMFF Programme specifies the overarching strategy for the Scheme and states that it will be focussed on promoting innovative approaches in fisheries and aquaculture areas to create growth and jobs in those areas, in particular by adding value to fishery and aquaculture products and diversifying the local economy towards new economic activities, in particular those offered by &lsquo;blue growth&rsquo; and the broader maritime sectors.  Each of the seven FLAGs devised a Local Development Strategy which guides their selection of projects for funding, consistent with this overarching strategy.<\/p><p>The Programme also provides that actions supported by FLAGs must ensure complementarity with, and avoid duplication of, measures provided under other EMFF schemes.  Other EMFF schemes provide capital grants to fishermen for investment on board and for value adding investments ashore and support innovation, professional advisory services, training, capacity building and networking of fishermen.<\/p><p>The seven FLAGs have awarded funding to a broad range of projects since 2017 including marine tourism and marine leisure, enhancements to smaller fishery harbour infrastructure, seafood festivals, marine heritage, marine environmental projects and micro seafood processing projects.<\/p><p>I understand that the application process for the FLAG scheme does not ask applcants if they own or crew on a fishing vessel.
