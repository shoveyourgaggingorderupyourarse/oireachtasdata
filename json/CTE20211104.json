No. 828B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 18 October 2021, providing information requested by the committee relating to compliance with procurement guidelines in respect of section 38 hospitals.  Is it agreed to request an information note from the HSE setting out the latest information regarding the compliance of section 38 hospitals with procurement guidelines?  Section 38 hospitals are the Mater, St. Vincent's and Tallaght Hospital.  Is it agreed to note and publish this item?  Agreed.  This has been flagged by Deputy Carthy.  Members will note that there is a pie chart on page 4 of the document showing that 85.96% of procurement information requested by the HSE was not supplied by section 38 hospitals and only 14.04% was supplied.  This related to &euro;131 million of expenditure.  Does Mr. McCarthy wish to comment on this?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021110400002#B00900","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1636018200,"counter":16,"content":"<p>The first thing to note is that there are more than three section 38 hospitals.  I think the number is 39.  The reference to the three hospitals may be because the original correspondence from Beaumont referred to those three hospitals.  It was making a specific point regarding that but there are more such hospitals than just the three.  The information is useful.  It describes what the system is but it does not give a significant amount of information about compliance.  Certainly that graphic is concerning.  That there would be non-response to the HSE from these hospitals is concerning.  One would expect the HSE to chase up on that and ensure it gets the explanations and information it needs or seeks to oversee compliance with procurement rules.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021110400002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1636018200,"counter":17,"content":"<p>We need to address this when the HSE appears before us because those section 38 hospitals receive in excess of &euro;4 billion.

When the HSE appears before us, we need to address how progress can be made on this because substantial public expenditure is involved and taxpayers' money is going out.  The HSE, which is the funding body, the Department and this committee need to know that proper procurement practices are being followed.<\/p><p>The fact that such sparse information is coming back is of huge concern.

It is information requested by the committee arising from our meeting with NAMA on 30 September 2021.  NAMA states:<\/p> <blockquote> \tApproximately 2,450 units were deemed unsuitable or were not required by local authorities at the time.  Such units were then offered to the open market for sale by the debtor\/receiver.<br \/><br \/>Another 2,000 units subsequently became unavailable; as part of a live portfolio, they were sold or let, on the open market, by the NAMA debtor\/receiver in order to repay debt.<br \/><br \/>Where demand was confirmed and the unit remained vacant and available, NAMA endeavoured to facilitate delivery of the units for social housing and provided funding for any required remediation works.  As at end-August 2021, NAMA had delivered 2,629 units for social housing from its secured portfolio. <\/blockquote> <p>It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy wished to raise this issue.  I do not know if he has joined us but the information is there from Ms Lawlor of NAMA.  There are two charts on the back of the correspondence that show the amount of housing offered and the amount of housing taken up.  Members can see the information for themselves.  Does any Member wish to comment?  No.<\/p><p>I propose that we take Nos. 841 and 845 together as they concern RT&Eacute;.  I will summarise each of them.  No. 841 is correspondence from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 22 October, in which he provides information requested by the committee on the examinations by the Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners of RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s treatment of certain individuals as contractors who should have been treated as employees.  In terms of Revenue&rsquo;s collection of PRSI from RT&Eacute;, the Secretary General notes that Revenue&rsquo;s organisational tax audit of RT&Eacute; incorporated PRSI between 2015 and 2018.  The Secretary General states that it is not possible to say at this point what level of PRSI liability, if any, will arise from the Department&rsquo;s own investigation.  It includes over 500 contractors and will start from their original dates of engagement with RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General states that the process can be complex and demanding and says:<\/p> <blockquote> \tRTE is fully engaged in this process and is cooperating fully with the Department as are the contractors with whom the Department has engaged.  Given the number of individual contractors involved and the duration of contracts to be considered, this investigation will take some time to complete. <\/blockquote> <p>No. 845 is correspondence from Ms Vivienne Flood, head of public affairs, RT&Eacute;, dated 21 October, in which she provides information requested by the committee on the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s audit report and defamation settlements.  In terms of the audit report, RT&Eacute; states that it cannot supply a breakdown of the contractors concerned due to personal data considerations relating to the GDPR.  However, RT&Eacute; do confirm that the contractors cover a broad range of roles and pay scales.  From our previous item of correspondence we know that this involves some 500 contractors.<\/p><p>As regards the committee&rsquo;s request for a copy of the Revenue Commissioner&rsquo;s audit report, RT&Eacute; states that to the best of its knowledge no formal report was prepared.  RT&Eacute; does provide the letter of confirmation from Revenue on its audit, which confirms that Revenue accepted over &euro;1.2 million from RT&Eacute; in respect of Revenue&rsquo;s conclusion that some individuals treated as contractors should have been treated as employees.<\/p><p>In the context of defamation settlements, RT&Eacute; states that the total amount paid for media settlements for the period 2010 to date is more than &euro;10.4 million.  This amount does not take into account refunds from RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s insurers.<\/p><p>No. 851B is correspondence from Ms Dee Forbes, the head of RT&Eacute;.  She declined our invitation to attend today on the basis that she is unavailable.  As Members are aware, RT&Eacute; has indicated that it can come before the committee in early January, which is the next slot available.  Is it agreed that we proceed with our engagement with RT&Eacute; on that date?  Agreed.<\/p><p>We will have representatives from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which is RT&Eacute; is subject to, before us later this month.  That Department provides funding to RT&Eacute; and ensures that it has a clear line of accountability.  In the first instance, I ask that Members raise any governance or control issues with the public funding provided to RT&Eacute; and we can follow up on any such matters in January.<\/p><p>I propose that we note and publish the two items regarding Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p>Deputies Carthy and Catherine Murphy have flagged these items.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021110400002#C00300","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1636018200,"counter":21,"content":"<p>And me, Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2021110400002#C00400","speaker":"1497"},{"type":"speech","time":1636018200,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I wish to refer to the Department's letter.  Even though I know that the Department can only supply an indicative timeline, I would like to know the following.  Is the investigation going to be completed within a specific timeframe or when does the Department hopes to conclude it?  With any finding, there is the possibility of an appeal.  Therefore, I ask the Department to outlines any appeals mechanism so that we know where we are and can timetable meetings accordingly.  It would be useful to have such information before the January meeting.<\/p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has cited the GDPR.  We do not seek specific details on individuals and, therefore, I see no reason we could not have a general response even if it is categorised by the class of employees.  For example, people who are now employees but were formerly self-employed.  I suggest that we ask RT&Eacute; for general information as opposed to specific information on individuals.<\/p> <p>  Did I hear the Chairman say that no audit report was issued but that one has now been concluded according to the letter from Revenue?  If there is a report, it would great if we could have it in redacted form.  I understand now that there was an audit but no audit report.  What did Revenue do?  Did it write to RT&Eacute; stating that the station owed &euro;1.2 million without qualifying how the sum was arrived at?  That seems a little bit strange.<\/p> <p>  If there is no report then there must be correspondence from Revenue to RT&Eacute; and that is what we probably mean.

It might be no harm to write to Revenue just to ask it about the paper trail, correspondence or whatever and whether, if RT&Eacute; was to request same, it would be furnished with it.  Then at least RT&Eacute; would have the details and would have to, I imagine, furnish us with that.<\/p> <p>  The other point was the Department of Social Protection has said the amount was under &euro;1 million and RT&Eacute; has said it cannot provide a breakdown because of GDPR, but can we write to RT&Eacute; asking it about the difference in figures between Revenue and the Department?  I think it said the Department used a figure of &euro;953,000 and Revenue had said over &euro;1.2 million.  Could we also ask it for a breakdown in relation to this?  We are not asking for individuals to be identified but how many individuals were involved.  We are talking about &euro;1 million.

Essentially, in respect of the Revenue audit, are we saying this is the only correspondence that was issued between the parties, namely, Revenue and RT&Eacute;?

I think we should, as Deputy Catherine Murphy suggested, ask for a detailed provision of all correspondence.  Of course if individuals are named or if there is personal information, that can be redacted.  The committee will accept that.  Likewise, I support Deputy Munster on the request for a breakdown of the RT&Eacute; personnel involved in the Revenue settlement.  There is a little bit of playing with words here on RT&Eacute;'s part.  It has taken this as a suggestion we are requesting personal information relating to individuals whereas the debate we had makes it clear we are looking for the numbers within each of the bands, as Deputy Munster said.

This matter was raised by Deputy Carthy.  Ms Mey states that the KPMG report has not yet been finalised.  A draft has been circulated to those involved and they have requested more time to consider it, which has been granted.  UL states: &ldquo;Once the University has received and considered the Report, it can be shared with the Committee subject to any legal restrictions and required redactions.&rdquo;  As regards the entertainment expenditure relating to a ceremony for the award of an honorary doctorate in New York, total costs, including travel and accommodation, are just short of &euro;37,000.  UL states that the expenditure relates to three events, including an event at Carnegie Hall to announce scholarships, which UL states is worth in the region of &euro;30,000 to it annually.

It is clear that we are not going to let this go.  It will be an issue we will want to deal with when they come before us in the new year.  We will want an update at that stage, if the matter has not already been concluded.  It has gone on for far too long.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the Garda stations, I had a look at those before.  Some of the stations were disposed of for very little money - a number in quite rural areas - and some looked as if they could be repurposed.  Are the terms of the lease sufficiently attractive to encourage those who take up leases, including local authorities, to invest in refurbishment?  Every one of these stations would require some degree of refurbishment in order to be repurposed.  I hope there is no impediment to their use.  It is good to see these buildings being used for community purposes, if that can be done and if there is an appropriate use for them.<\/p> <p>  One matter I would like us to look at when the officials come before us is the cost-effectiveness appraisal carried out by the OPW.  I have to say that one of the items raised a very serious flag with me and it looked to me that it was pretty much in the same family as Miesian Plaza, and that is the new headquarters for the Data Protection Commissioner.  I can send the Chair a note on that.  I think it is on page 88 but, in any event, I will send the note on and it can be circulated.  There appeared to be some significant issues in regard to the location that was selected and whether alternative properties were looked at.  I want to raise that very specifically with them when they come in.  I will send the Chair a note on it because we cannot keep on repeating the same mistakes.

Members might peruse the recommendations and make any suggestions they have.<\/p> <p>  There is one item of correspondence that was not flagged and arose at an earlier meeting.  It is something I raised with the secretariat.  I wished to get an update.  Members will recall the issue of Perrigo and its settlement with Revenue for &euro;297 million.  There was a tax liability of &euro;1.64 billion.  It ended up with a write-down of approximately 84%, which was the issue other members and I were concerned about.  Correspondence may have been received in recent days but this is before us today.  I ask the secretariat to see whether we have received further correspondence or replies on this from Revenue and the Tax Appeals Commission, which we wrote to at the time.  If nothing is received by the end of this week, the secretariat might follow up with the Tax Appeals Commission and Revenue seeking an explanation as to why there was an 84% write-down in respect of the &euro;1.64 billion Perrigo was liable for.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  The next matter is the work programme.  At our meeting of 21 October, we agreed our work programme to the end of the year.  It was mentioned earlier that RT&Eacute; was unable to attend today's meeting.  As all our meeting slots until the end of the year have been confirmed, the clerk has advised that RT&Eacute; has indicated its availability to reschedule the meeting to 20 January, the next available slot we have.  Is it agreed the committee will proceed with that meeting?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  In respect of our speaking slots, as there are no public engagements, is it agreed that the rotation for today's meeting will be extended to next week, to be fair to members who were selected to be first?  Agreed.  On 11 November, the Department of Transport will appear before the committee; on 18 November, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; on 25 November, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; on 2 December, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners; on 9 December, the Department of Social Protection, at which members will have an opportunity to raise some of the issues raised today; and on 16 December, the Department of Health.  If there are matters members want raised with any of those Departments or bodies, they might flag them with the secretariat.<\/p> <p>  We have a busy agenda next week with the Department of Transport.  The issues relate to the 2020 appropriation account for Vote 31, transport; the motor tax account; from the 2020 report on the accounts of the public services, chapter 5, expenditure and night-vision technology and training for search and rescue; the recently published Comptroller and Auditor General's special report 113, in respect of the procurement of vehicles for the Irish Coast Guard; and our request for information regarding expenditure on the following projects, which is due by tomorrow, namely, MetroLink, the DART extension and underground, BusConnects and the all-Ireland strategic rail review.  At our last meeting, we agreed to revisit the work programme for the year later this month.  There were two suggestions today, which will be added to the end of the work programme.<\/p> <p>  That concludes our consideration of the work programme.

The amendment is important, therefore, to ensure public awareness of the initial process regarding DMAPs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#A01800","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":82,"content":"<p>One of our many concerns is that the national marine planning framework, NMPF, is not fully compliant with the directives.<\/p><p>It sets out fairly general policy objectives, some of which are laudable while others are not so laudable in the case of liquid natural gas, LNG, storage and infrastructure.

It is about general objectives.  Our concern is that the DMAPs arising from that must ensure that the gaps we believe exist in the national marine planning framework are plugged properly.  It is not even clear to us that the DMAPs must be fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive and various EU directives.  Could the Minister of State tell us where in the Bill can we find the requirement to be fully in compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and other directives specifically in terms of DMAPs?  Given our concerns in this regard, this is an attempt to ensure that all the necessary study and public consultation are done and all the concerns for environmental sensitivities are fully explored and we have the necessary consultation around heritage with the Minister and consult the public fully regarding the development of any DMAP because we see the DMAPs as plugging the gap for the lack of detail in the national marine planning framework.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#A01900","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":84,"content":"<p>The detail here is to ensure the generalities are covered and that protections are put in place so that public consultation is taken on board and this Bill is compliant.

I must initially advise the members of a referencing error in section 23 - public participation on DMAPs.  Section 23(1) provides that the competent authority (D) shall publish its public participation statement after complying with section 22 - preparing a draft DMAP.  It is intended instead that the statement is to published as soon as possible after the DMAP proposal has been approved.  I apologise for any confusion this may have caused and we intend to correct the error on Report Stage.<\/p> <p>  A competent authority (D) will submit a DMAP proposal to the competent authority (M), which will review the proposal to ensure compliance with this part and the MSP directive.  The proposal will also include a draft public participation statement.  As soon as possible after approval, the proposal and statement are to be published.  This serves as the starting point of the DMAP development process.  Through the participation processes, it is anticipated that the DMAP will evolve from the proposal as new information, issues and considerations are raised.  This was certainly our experience in the first national marine planning framework resulting in a far better outcome than strict adherence to early thinking.  <\/p> <p>  At the proposal stage, it is very much a case of known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  If we waited until all data gaps were identified and filled, a DMAP would never progress beyond proposal stage.  It is through the DMAP development process that much of the detail such as data gaps and location-specific issues will emerge and be considered to determine the appropriate outcome to be expressed in the DMAP.  This is why participation has been so key to maritime spatial planning to date and will continue to be under this legislation.  This will also be a new process for everyone - officials, the public, stakeholders and industry.  As our collective experience in making DMAPs grows, that learning can be applied to future DMAPs though section 21(4).<\/p> <p>  I now turn to the amendments under consideration.  Amendment No. 105 proposes a number of additional matters to be specified in a DMAP proposal.  A number of these are already provided for generally by the initiated text or are details to be examined or emerge from the DMAP development process itself.  Subsections (h) and (i) are duplicative to a certain extent.  DMAPs when made will form part of the national marine planning framework and are to be considered in the preparation of the DMAP under section 22(1)(c).  Subsection (i) is unclear in both language and intent.  It is presumed that this is intended to detail the interaction of existing and future proposed usages.  This is appropriate to examine explore during DMAP development - not the proposal, which, as mentioned, above is only the starting point.  Subsection (j) is already covered broadly in the evidence base under section 21(1)(f).  Subsections (k) and (l) are matters to be explored in depth during the development process.  Subsection (m) is not an operable provision.  It presupposes inadequacies in the national marine planning framework and deals with other subjective matters impossible for a competent authority (D) to undertake in the context of DMAP development.  It also would in effect turn the oversight structures of the regime on their head.  Examination of what the national marine planning framework can do better next time is a matter for the review of the framework itself.  Subsection (n) is already covered under section 21(2)(a) in the objectives of the national marine planning framework that the DMAP is seeking to achieve or support.  Subsection (o) is already covered as part of the DMAP development considerations under section 22(1)(c).  Subsection (p) is not operable as marine protected areas do not yet have a legal existence.  It should be noted that the specific environmental circumstances of a DMAP area will have to be, as a matter of necessity, considered and explored in the context of existing and proposed usages in order to specify the environmental mitigation and beneficial measures to be specified in the DMAP under section 22(2)(h).<\/p> <p>  Regarding subsection (q), the meaning of the term \"pursuit\" is not clear but it is presumed to mean lobbying of the kind discussed at earlier sessions.  Amendment of the lobbying and access to information on the environment-freedom of information legislation is the appropriate vehicle for such changes.<\/p><p>One can of course see why this amendment cannot be accepted.  However, it does not appear that there is too much distance between the existing text and the intention and purpose of the proposed amendment.  What is mainly at issue is how explicitly these matters are stated and where in the overall process they occur.  I think everyone will agree that the vital point is that these elements are undertaken, where appropriate, and not precisely where they happen.  It is anticipated that DMAPs may take many forms and serve many purposes, and not only direct marine analogues of terrestrial plans or for industrial sector plans.  For example, it has it has mooted that it may be possible to prepare a DMAP in respect of sea grass meadows.  The possibilities for DMAPs are almost endless, as long as they serve to deliver the objectives of the national marine planning framework.  The legislation was crafted with this variety in mind.  Drilling too far down into specifics for the proposed requirement provisions endangers that flexibility and will present some of the best uses of what we believe is the most powerful marine spatial planning tool in this Bill.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 106 proposes to require consultation on a given proposal prior to finalisation.  In spirt and in principle, this is right and proper and I fully agree.  Recall, however, that the proposal is just the starting point for DMAP development.  The consultation on the proposal and the development of the DMAP are one and the same process, given the intended participatory and evolutionary nature of the development process.  It is about as comprehensive a consultation process as possible.<\/p><p> We are innovating here, moving away from a static set piece formal consultation process only model into a participatory emergent model where the outcomes arise from the process.  This we strongly believe reflects both the fundamental spirit, wording and intent of the maritime spatial planning, MSP, directive.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 107 proposes a requirement to publish reasons for approval.  There is only a single reason for approval that will apply to all DMAP proposals and it is set out in section 21(4)(a).  That reason is that the proposal complies with all the requirements of Part 2 and the MSP directive, insofar as they relate to the proposal.  A proposal either meets that standard or it does not.  For the above reasons, I oppose this amendment also.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#B00300","speaker":"1595","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":87,"content":"<p>I welcome that the Minister of State has acknowledged the error and that he is going to correct it.  Related to that is the issue of unknown knowns.  Part of what we are trying to do here in having a good planning process is identifying unknowns that are risks to marine environment and trying to see how they will be addressed in the process.  I have a few concerns.  One of my key concerns is that there is not sufficient provision in the legislation to ensure DMAPs, and the process around them, are being carried out in line with the marine spatial planning directive.  That is a core concern.<\/p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Boyd Barrett said.  I have a huge concern that the overall process is an incremental approach to planning and that it is looking at filling in gaps rather than first doing a thorough, plan-led, detailed approach that is incremental and stage-by-stage.  After the last meeting, I thought about the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the public consultation process.  It is clear the Minister of State and the officials put much work into the public consultation process.  It is important to acknowledge that.  However, the question on public consultation is never about how much work the people working on it put into it.  Neither is it about how good the people leading the public consultation process think it is.  It is about how good the wider public and stakeholders think the consultation process is.  That is not a criticism of anyone.  It is normal in any consultation process that people who have put in all the work feel they have done a thorough consultation process.  It is also normal that the general public and stakeholders might feel that it maybe was not as good, and that there was not enough awareness.  That is a quite a natural gap.<\/p> <p>  What we are seeking to do through these proposed amendments is to ensure that consultation is as strong and robust as possible, from the point of view of stakeholders and the general public, as opposed to people who are burdened with all the work in running the public consultation process.  It is important to acknowledge that no matter how much work is put in, and how thorough a public consultation process is, it may not meet expectations of the public.  However, the key point is that consultation is strong enough to elicit the key information from stakeholders and from communities and that it is elicited at an early stage in the process.  The more that is brought out at an early stage in the process, then more complex issues and a larger number of issues can be resolved at an earlier stage.<\/p> <p>  The issue here is around the gaps in the process around DMAPs.  We have identified weaknesses in the process as presented in the Bill.  We are seeking to strengthen it through these proposed amendments to make it a more robust process.  A more robust, clearer, stronger process is in the interests of everyone, as well as the marine environment.  A more robust process will work for all stakeholders.  One of the issues to date is that there has been a lack of a robust planning process.  That is causing issues for people who are seeking to develop renewable wind energy, as well as everybody else.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#C00200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan.

The logic is clear in our seeking to put in \"coexistance\" instead of \"colocation\".  The thinking behind this proposed amendment is informed by an ecosystem approach.  Can things survive together in the same area without a significant impact on ecosystems and on biodiversity?  Could a particular type of development in a particular area have a negative impact on other things we seek to protect and preserve?  We do not want an imperative in this Bill to colocate, for example, liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals with a marine protected area.  We have to have both.  We want coexistance that guarantees the continuation of vital ecosystems, marine biology, and livelihoods that might be made in that area by particular groups.  That is the logic behind the proposed amendment.  The Government accepted this in a previous amendment.  Maybe the Government can indicate that it is going to do so again.<\/p> <p>  On the known knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns, that is vaguely humorous on one level.  However, it is quite serious on another level.  I am still unclear on this, but it seems that anybody, or at least quite a few people, can do a DMAP.  These people might want to do a DMAP for very different reasons.  I am concerned and confused about that.  What is the objective of that particular DMAP?  If, for example, a Department is particularly concerned about developing industrial offshore wind, that would be its objective.  It would want to do a DMAP to facilitate that.  However, that could have significant knock-on impacts for heritage, for protecting fishers&rsquo; livelihoods, for impacts on the local community, for marine biodiversity, and so on.  The lead body would have a particular objective.  In that context, arguably, it might not have a hell of a lot of interest in filling in the gaps on the known unknowns or, even more so, the unknown unknowns that are not set out in the national marine planning framework or that sort of detailed knowledge of a particular marine environment.<\/p><p>We are trying to get an acknowledgement that those known unknowns, and even more so the unknown unknowns, are often things that are only known by people who really live and operate in the area and thus have knowledge and experience of a particular marine environment, whereas a Department that has the objective to do a particular thing may not know any of that stuff and would have gaps in its knowledge.  Therefore, we want it written into legislation that before we decide that such a body is going to do the DMAP because it has a particular objective, we want to know the following.  First, what is its objective, on which there would be consultation.  It should not just be up to the Minister to say a body can do the DMAP.  Second, we want an acknowledgement, as part of the decision-making process, of what we do not know and have to find out before we make a decision about whether a particular body is competent and whether its objectives are acceptable and appropriate for this particular marine environment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#C00400","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 108 proposes to delete &ldquo;colocation&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;coexistance&rdquo; in section 22.

It is a public body accountable to the Minister but the individuals on the board would not have the same level of accountability to the public or the democratic process as the Minister has.

Amendment No. 130 proposes to require that six particular persons representing very specific, but important, interests in the maritime area be appointed to the board of the MARA.  On Second Stage, we were accused of creating a board that is not balanced.  We are seeking to address this in amendment No. 129.  In my view, this proposal would result in a similar imbalance.  That is not to say that the particular experts listed will not be important in the proper functioning of MARA; they will, but there are other ways to ensure that the relevant expertise is deployed in the correct manner within the organisation.  We must make a distinction between day-to-day operations and board oversight.<\/p> <p>  First, through my own amendment, such persons can already be appointed to the board.  However, we must be mindful of what the board of a State agency needs to do as set out in section 45 and a suitable balance of people needs to be appointed to it.<\/p> <p>  Second, in section 51, I have made provision for the board to establish specialist committees to provide it with the appropriate advice in areas including, but not limited to, those set out in this amendment.  This, I am sure the members will agree, will provide a useful tool in the proper functioning of the organisation as a whole and will allow MARA to engage with the sectoral specialists set out in the amendment.<\/p> <p>  Third, MARA will, of course, be required to either directly employ the relevant specialist expertise to operate various functions set out in section 41 or engage with other public bodies with the relevant expertise to do so under the provisions set out in section 63.<\/p> <p>  As always, I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment but it would be contrary to the spirit of my amendment if I were to create a similar imbalance to the board in the manner set out.  I must oppose the amendment, but I will offer the members the opportunity, if they so wish, to withdraw it in favour of my amendment No. 129.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 131 requires there to be a representative of the fishing industry, which makes a valuable contribution, on the board.  While I appreciate the sentiment, the wording of this text is imprecise and open to challenge.  It does not prescribe what part of the industry should be represented on MARA and could be subject to the accusation of excluding other sectors of the industry or, indeed, other industries operating in the maritime area.<\/p> <p>  There is sufficient scope in amendment No. 129 to facilitate the wish to have representation from this sector on the board.

In all seriousness, could the Minister of State explain why the term \"if any\" is used in his amendment and in the Bill in terms of the appointment of other persons for the board?  For example, if the membership of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, did not include doctors and scientists, but was only guaranteed to include departmental officials, we would be a little worried about the protection of public health.  This is the protection of marine health, which, by the way, is public health as well.  It is the sustainability of human existence, etc.  It is fairly important.<\/p> <p>  On the idea that it would not be absolutely hard-wired into the board membership to have people who are expert in marine biology, I take the Chair's point.  We would have to think about how you would do it, but it is a fair point that there would be somebody who has real knowledge of working on the sea, such as a fisher and not merely someone claiming to represent fishers.  I refer to the appointment of persons who really have that expert knowledge and that we are certain, not if they might be there if somebody such as the Minister may decide they will be there.  It is that they will be there.  They are guaranteed to be there and that knowledge and expertise will be brought to bear on the composition of the board.<\/p> <p>  I do not understand the Minister of State's fear of imbalance.  I do not see what the fear is in that regard.  I do not get it.  Could the Minister of State elaborate on that point?  How could it be anything other than a positive contribution to the composition of the board to have the experts from university in those key areas and experts in the EU law?  An important component of Deputies Gould and &Oacute; Broin's proposal here is that we have somebody who really knows back-to-front EU law, knows the directives back to front, and is sure that decisions being made by the board are compliant and, indeed, even better, consistent and compatible with the objectives of the directives in a proactive way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2021110400002#P00500","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1635984000,"counter":454,"content":"<p>The key issue is independence of the board.  In order to operate well, function well, be able to sometimes give a different view and, if necessary, call an issue out, boards need to have a degree of independence as well as expertise.  Amendment No. 129 is a marginal improvement on what is contained in the Bill whereby it is stated that several of the members of the board would be officers of Departments, etc.  Effectively, this amendment leaves us with a board including the chair, who, of course, could potentially be a Department official, two officers of Departments and one person from the CCMA.  I mean no disrespect to the CCMA, which has huge expertise, but it will not rock the boat either.  Officers of Departments will not rock the boat.  If necessary, they are constrained.  Then it is up to six, if any.  We do know that there will be six.  We do not know, of that six, four or however many are appointed, if there will be independent.  If there is to be expertise, they could be officers and officials from Departments as well.  The entire board could, with the exception of the CCMA representative, be made up of officials from Departments.  That will not provide the balance and independence that is needed.<\/p> <p>  I accept that those involved will bring with them a level of expertise but there will be expertise and skills missing from the board on that basis.  Given that the original composition of the board that was suggested was specifying that several of the members of the board would be coming from Departments and agencies, it is not unreasonable to think that a good many of the additional six will come via that route also.<\/p><p>That is the key here.  I agree with the comments of the other Deputies on having experts from fishing communities.  You cannot get more expertise than you will get from fishing communities, marine biodiversity experts and environmental experts.  This expertise is key.  I am not hung up on the wording but it is a question of having the principles included.  If setting up bodies in other areas, we would not dream of not having experts and key stakeholders represented.  Coastal local authorities are stakeholders, as reflected in the requirement to have a CCMA representative.  This is positive but the CCMA is but one of several stakeholders.  The CCMA representative is the only member outside the Departments whose expertise will definitely be reflected on the board.

The board is a corporate governance structure; it is an oversight mechanism.  The chief executive and the chief executive's team have the expertise in respect of development consents, and adjudication is their job.  It is to misunderstand the corporate structure to suggest the board will be making the decisions.  NPHET is a good example in this regard.  We will have the expertise, through the chief executive and chief executive's team, to adjudicate on applications.  However, the board provides the oversight, holding the chief executive to account in the governance structure.

We are in uncharted territory.  We made many mistakes in respect of planning on land over the years.  It has taken a long time to address this and there is still a long way to go to get it right.  Let us get on the right foot with this extremely important legislation and this undertaking whose aim is to plan for, develop and protect our marine environment.  The thrust of these excellent amendments is to ensure that people who really know their stuff and are to some degree independent of the Department will be included.  It is not an unfair comment or a criticism of departmental officials to say they are constrained.  They have certain objectives for their Departments and so on.
