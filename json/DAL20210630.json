I am glad to raise it on behalf of my constituents.<\/p>  <p>  The Barrow railway bridge is a historic structure connecting the counties of Wexford and Kilkenny along the currently disused Rosslare to Waterford railway line.  It opened in 1906 and it closed to passenger traffic in 2010.  The maintenance arrangement with Irish Rail was to maintain the line for ten years after closure.  Last winter, I asked in a parliamentary question if the maintenance arrangement for the line could be extended until a decision had been made on its future.  I am pleased to report that in 2021, a weed spraying train passed along the line from Rosslare to Waterford, across the Barrow bridge.  I hope this maintenance will continue.<\/p>  <p>  For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the bridge itself, it has a section in the centre that can turn 90 degrees to open the bridge to allow boats to pass through.  There has been much debate, particularly in recent times, about the future of the line and what that will be.  Some people would like to see a return to rail services linking the south east with the rest of Ireland and a proper service while others would like to see the line turned into a greenway to connect to Waterford and to the Dungarvan greenway.  The third option is to develop a greenway alongside the rail line.<\/p>  <p>  The result of the rail review will help inform the next steps in that regard, but regardless of which of the three options are chosen, it will be necessary for the Barrow bridge to be maintained and remain in operational condition.  It cannot be allowed to deteriorate and it should not be left in the open position, if it is not designed as such and if that has the potential to damage the mechanism.<\/p>  <p>  Given the fact there is an ongoing review, which is examining the potential to reopen the railway line, can the Minister of State commit to ensuring that the bridge is left in the closed position until the results of the rail review have been completed and a decision has been made on the rail line&rsquo;s future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000003#A00300","speaker":"1622"},{"type":"speech","time":1625040720,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Murphy for giving me the opportunity to discuss this issue in the House today.  As many Members will be aware, rail services on this particular line ceased operation in 2010 under an agreement between the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  A number of improvements were made to bus services in the area at the time to ensure continued public transport connectivity.  A number of parties have raised concerns that the decision to maintain the Barrow bridge in the current open position means that services may never again run on this line.<\/p>  <p>  I do not wish to give false hope to anyone with regard to any imminent return of services but I would like to clarify that the decision to maintain the bridge in an open position is a pragmatic one, based on the fact that the line has now been closed for more than ten years.  During this time, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has continued to maintain the Barrow bridge and has operated it for maritime activity related to the Port of New Ross.  The open position of the bridge reflects the need to ensure easy navigational access to the port.  In the absence of any rail services on the line, it is entirely appropriate that the right of way should be given to the marine traffic to pass through the bridge unencumbered.<\/p>  <p>  Since the decision to close the line, a number of revised arrangements were agreed between the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann relating to the line.  These arrangements include obligations to review the level of crossing services each year, reviewing the boundary protection along the line each year, and conducting bridge inspections every two years, in line with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s technical standards.  In addition, the agreement between the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann requires a general review of the line to be undertaken annually.  The purpose of the review is to assess the overall condition of the line so as to be able to provide a current status assessment of the infrastructure each year.  The revised arrangements also provide that the Barrow bridge be maintained in an open position.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that the planned securing of the bridge in the open position is a temporary measure and in no way removes the future functionality of the bridge for carrying rail traffic, should services on this line resume.  Neither, I stress, does it in any way impede consideration of the line in the context of the strategic rail review.  I understand larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will ensure the continued functionality of the bridge through scheduled movements, which will allay any potential concerns that may exist as regards the permanency of train&rsquo;s position.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the design of the mechanism is such that it can easily be reversed if rail services do resume at some point in the future.  I look forward to the strategic rail review and its consideration of the strategic potential of the rail network the island of Ireland, including the Wexford to Waterford line.  I trust this clarifies the position with regard to the Barrow bridge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000003#A00500","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1625040720,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

Only then can we estimate what damage may have occurred, if any.

The two of us fought in the trenches when the boundary transition between Cork city and county was undertaken in 2017.  Will any assessment be undertaken now or at some stage in the future to scrutinise the successes and failures of the expansion of the Cork City Council boundary?  The purpose of the question is not to reignite the debate, which goes back to 2016, but is motivated by a genuine desire to undertake an analysis of how the boundary transition has worked or not worked.  I live in the new city area.  To be fair to Cork City Council, I contend that we have seen an improvement in services locally in Glanmire and other areas such as Blarney, Tower, and towards Donoughmore and Inniscarra.<\/p>  <p>  Any process which involves essentially doubling the population of the city and increasing its size fivefold geographically is bound to pose challenges and I will speak about some of them.  Before I give a few examples, I will first say that all citizens of Cork, especially those in transition areas, were told repeatedly that by transferring into a new jurisdiction, the level of service they received would not be affected or diminished in any way.  This has not been the case.  I have identified a few areas.  There are more which we might discuss in future.  I highlight development contributions.  When the city initially took over large tracts of rural agricultural land in the former county area, there was no policy about planning contributions devised for agricultural buildings.  Farmers who were building farm sheds, outhouses and so on were charged commercial rates as if they were building in the city centre.  It took about 14 months for that process to be weaned out.  That is an example of where the boundary transition did not proceed as smoothly as it could.<\/p>  <p>  A second point relates to planning applications for one-off houses.  Many of us speak about the national planning framework and its potential impact on rural housing.  Aside from the national planning framework and its impacts, there is clearly a different interpretation of the existing development plan in Cork City Council.  The council has a higher success rate in delivering one-off houses in those former rural areas.  That is down to a different interpretation of the existing plan.<\/p>  <p>  The third point relates to local improvement schemes, LIS, and community involvement schemes, CIS.  There are many roads in rural areas which people pay a contribution towards.  They typically pay a contribution of between 10% and 15% to have the roads done.  Many of those projects were lined up but unfortunately when the boundary transitioned, the schemes all fell by the wayside.  I asked the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, about the issue a number of times via parliamentary questions.  She said that perhaps Cork County Council would give some of its budget for CIS and LIS to Cork City Council.  That suggestion is not workable.  We know that one jurisdiction will not give some of its roads budget away to another jurisdiction.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer to planning enforcement, which is my main motivation for tabling this Topical Issue matter today, after the Minister of State replies.  The agreement between the two local authorities was that Cork City Council would take on new planning enforcement files and Cork County Council would continue to engage with active planning enforcement files on its own system.  Unfortunately, after the transition, Cork County Council received legal advice that I believe goes against the spirit of the agreement it entered into, that it would now not be the competent authority to prosecute any planning enforcement issues.  That is a major cause for concern and goes against the spirit of the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000004#B00300","speaker":"1521"},{"type":"speech","time":1625041320,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and providing an opportunity to update the House.  The Cork boundary alteration is the most significant of its kind undertaken in the State and represents a major reorganisation of local government in Cork.  The main aim of the boundary extension was to allow the potential for further development within a new Cork City Council area, while also incentivising higher density development and reducing the risk of sprawl.  The extended city area now includes Ballincollig, Carrigrohane, Blarney, Glanmire and Cork Airport and the population of the city increased by more than 85,000 people.<\/p>  <p>  The Local Government Act 2019 was enacted on 31 January 2019 to provide for the transfer of part of the administrative area of Cork County Council to the administrative area of Cork City Council.  This took place when the new councils took office after the local elections in May 2019.  The Act also provided for the establishment of the statutory Cork boundary alteration implementation oversight committee to oversee arrangements for the alteration of the boundary in accordance with the statutory implementation plan.  Responsibility for the detailed planning and implementation of the reorganisation process rests primarily with the two local authorities, subject to the guidance and supervision provided by the oversight committee to ensure compliance with the implementation plan.  Work on finalising the transfer of functions was completed in late 2020 and both authorities have confirmed that all the actions contained in the statutory implementation plan have been discharged with new service delivery models now in place in both authorities.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is aware that a small number of outstanding practical issues are still being worked through by both authorities with support being provided by the Department.  We are confident that these outstanding matters will be settled soon.  These matters relate to sections 13(1)(a), 31 and 34 of the Local Government Act 2019 and they mostly relate to planning matters and responsibility for individual planning cases that were in train at the time of the boundary transfer day.  The Department is working closely with the two local authorities to resolve these matters.  Should the need arise, the Local Government Act 2019 also provides a mechanism for resolving outstanding issues up to and including a ministerial decision.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000004#B00400","speaker":"1573"},{"type":"speech","time":1625041320,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

I welcome the Minister of State's comment that responsibility for settling outstanding issues resides with the two local authorities.  At the same time, it is subject to the guidance and supervision of the oversight committee to ensure compliance with the implementation plan.  The Minister of State has identified a number of problems, although they are described as a small number of outstanding practical issues.  How many times has the oversight committee met subsequent to the boundary agreement?  What was the outcome of those meetings?  What advice was given to both local authorities?  These issues have continued for a couple of years.  As a representative in the area, I do not see any resolution to the outstanding problems.  If it is open to the oversight committee to ensure compliance with the implementation plan, I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Minister to ensure the oversight committee reconvenes to resolve the outstanding issues.  This is unfair for people.<\/p>  <p>  The real motivation for me raising this is planning enforcement issues.

I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue.<\/p>  <p>  I will provide a brief background.  It was the wording in the previous Mental Health Commission report in 2018 that got me.  It said the Owenacurra centre \"was\" a 24-bed unit situated in the middle of the town.  It \"was\" a single-storey prefab building centred around an internal courtyard.  There were 16 single bedrooms and four twin bedrooms.  We learned as recently as last Monday that the centre would be closed on the basis of a number of reports.  I thank the Minister of State for letting me know that it was coming, but it was still a shock.<\/p>  <p>  The centre had 19 long-term residents, but it also has a day-care centre, long-stay facilities and respite care.  It served a lot of the east Cork area as people travelled from Youghal, Cobh and other places to use the centre.  I spoke to a number of staff in the centre.  We know the patients are the priority at the moment and getting suitable accommodation or services for them.<\/p>  <p>  The location of the centre in Midleton is a very valuable site and having spoken to people they are fearful about what will happen given that the building has been condemned as not being fit for purpose.  In this day and age, it is strange to have prefab units.  I know from previous reports of the Mental Health Commission that the same phrases came up all the time: \"not fit for purpose\" and \"falling apart\", and there were references to ceilings coming down.  I got so angry when I heard they were just going to shut it between now and the end of October, which is very soon.  Why did the HSE not put resources into the building to maintain it in the way people maintain their house or garden?<\/p>  <p>  We in Midleton and in east Cork do not want this centre to be a big white elephant after October and then listen to bickering from all sides saying it is a valuable site and we do not know what we are going to do with it.  We need all those services in Midleton.  We need them in that centre on that site.  The staff there want some kind of commitment from either the Minister or the HSE, preferably both, that we will not have a derelict building in October, which will draw anti-social behaviour and in the worst-case scenario end up going on fire.  What we need is a commitment that something will be replaced on the site to guarantee the same or even better services than we had before.<\/p>  <p>  Most of the staff there seem happy enough to be redeployed and there is good engagement with them.  I always give credit where it is due, but I do not trust the HSE.  It stated that a plan for the future of the site would be considered in due course.  Basically, it does not have a plan for the site yet and that makes me fearful.  We should have something similar back on the site as soon as possible because it is a necessity.  The Minister of State is aware of the situation given her current and recent portfolios that people are not getting any younger.  Mental health issues are increasing, and they will probably increase further.  I seek a commitment that a fit-for-purpose building will be put back on the site that can benefit east Cork.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000005#C00400","speaker":"1452"},{"type":"speech","time":1625041920,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Butler, sends her sincere apologies for not being here to address this very important issue herself.  She is before the Select Committee on Health this morning, to bring forward legislation, and so it could not be avoided.<\/p>  <p>  From the outset, I reassure the Deputy that the current and future care needs of the residents of the Owenacurra Centre have been paramount in all decisions and actions taken by the HSE.  Owenacurra is a continuing care unit located in Midleton, Cork and currently has 19 residents.  It is a single-storey building constructed in the early 1970s and is very much a building of its time.  Following its most recent inspection in February this year, the Mental Health Commission raised concerns about persistent non-compliance with regulations on the premises.  I note for context that the commission inspects all approved centres at least once a year and plays a vital role in assisting us in improving our mental health services for all.  The premises at Owenacurra were highlighted and risk rated as critical.  I note here for context that the report noted overall compliance at 83%, up from 80% in 2020.<\/p>  <p>  On foot of this latest inspection, HSE mental health services commissioned the HSE estates department to review the current condition of the premises.  I understand that following a number of detailed assessments, it formed the opinion that the building is in an unacceptably poor condition with major defects and that the layout is unsuitable for adequate infection prevention and control.  Following this, Cork-Kerry Mental Health Services determined that a refurbishment could not bring the building to the standards required.  Therefore, on 23 June, they notified the Mental Health Commission that the Owenacurra Centre would close on a phased basis between now and 31 October.<\/p>  <p>  The immediate priority of the HSE is to consult with residents and their families individually and to agree an appropriate alternative placement based on their assessed needs.  Cork-Kerry Mental Health Services have a plan for this, and management will also engage with staff and their representative bodies.<\/p>  <p>  A mental health day service is also located within the building.  Work is under way to identify an alternative location for this service, as close as possible to the current location.  The future of the entire site will be considered at a later stage.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the HSE is committed to improving its infrastructure, including new or improved community-based facilities and services for people with more severe and enduring mental health difficulties.  Of the additional &euro;50 million Exchequer funding provided in 2021, &euro;7 million will fund reconfiguration of mental health facilities, in line with Mental Health Commission Covid risk assessment recommendations.  This, plus the recurring &euro;6 million in new development funding, means there is &euro;13 million for minor works and refurbishments in 2021.<\/p>  <p>  In 2020, the HSE drew down almost &euro;4 million in once-off new development funding to improve the physical infrastructure of 16 mental health community and inpatient units, in line with Sharing the Vision recommendations and commission regulations.  The Government is committed to the improvement and development of all aspects of mental health services through implementation of Sharing the Vision.  The policy aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum from mental health promotion, prevention and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery during the period 2020-30.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of premises, I also highlight that the new 170-bed National Forensic Mental Health Service Hospital complex in Portrane will replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum this year.  This new state-of-the-art facility will include a 130-bed adult unit, a ten-bed forensic child and adolescent unit and a 30-bed intensive care rehabilitation unit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000005#C00500","speaker":"1484"},{"type":"speech","time":1625041920,"counter":23,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for the reply, but while it is welcome, the Central Mental Hospital is in Dundrum not Midleton.  We are talking about getting local services.<\/p> <p>Local knowledge is local expertise.  When any service is run in the community, people get to know each other and more trust is built up.  I would not say there is a more laid-back working relationship but there is more understanding and there is harmony and more empathy and respect.  As I said at the start, however, our biggest fear concerns what will happen once the service is gone.  Surprisingly, what has happened has taken only a couple of months.  There has been a very fast step-down and shut-down of the unit, which is worrying, bearing in mind the state in which the building has been.  Despite that, I need somebody to commit that once the building is decommissioned and closed, something will replace it in the area.  Reference was made in the reply to which I referred to moving the day-care services but the authorities have not identified anything yet.  I acknowledge the new 55-bed extension being done across the road, in a very old hospital.  It is community led and run, which is fabulous.  There should be more of this but the biggest fear concerns the fact that we cannot afford to lose the service in Midleton.  We cannot let the building rot or be sold for something else.

It is a tribute to them that the Bill is before the D&aacute;il.  I want also to thank the staff of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, who worked with us on the legislation over a number of years.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, I met a delegation of retired workers outside the D&aacute;il on a miserable, wet and cold day.  They were well organised and passionate about their cause.  They carried a real grievance about their treatment since retirement.   They were retired ESB workers.  Later, we met with retired workers from RT&Eacute;, Eir, Bord na M&oacute;na, the Civil Service and myriad other State and semi-State companies.  Despite the differences in their particular workplaces, a common theme was the feeling of having been abandoned once they retired.  They were protesting against changes that had profound and negative consequences on their pensions. These included cuts in payments, the severing of the link with the working colleagues and other changes of which they were not notified, not consulted upon and the results of which they could not even question or seek any redress on.<\/p>  <p>  These workers built this State and its infrastructure.  Often, they built their trade unions and won the pay and conditions enjoyed by the members of the current workforce in their workplaces.  Yet, once they retired, these workers became invisible and unrepresented.  They are often seen as the collateral damage in deals done without any thought for the consequences for them or the impact on their living standards.  They have no redress and no right to arbitration or representation once a period of six months has passed since they retired.  As one worker said, they are treated like bees.  If they are not worker bees, they do not seem to count.  For all the platitudes that are used about how important older people are,  the reality is that they are poorly served and cared for by the State they have built.  We are told about the demographic time bomb and we are warned about the burden of people living longer.  The language used is telling - if you are not a worker bee and are unable to be economically productive, you are seen as a burden, regardless of the contribution you have made in your working life.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate, we are surrounded by the many of the bigger arguments such as the fight for the right to retire at 65 or 66 years of age, the demand for greater contributions from young workers towards their pensions, etc.  At the same time, these young workers will be subject to phenomenal reductions in their benefits when they retire.  There are also arguments around the onslaught on defined benefit schemes and the demands from the pension industry, and so on.  I have views on these issues which are probably very different from those of the Ministers and other Deputies in the House.  For now, I will simply state that I reject much of the hysteria relating to this debate.  There are options and alternatives available that could see us defend the right to retire at the age of 65 on liveable pensions with access to good public services and healthcare.<\/p>  <p>  Regardless of the views of those in this House on these wider issues, however, nothing in the great pension debate can justify not giving retired workers a say or a right to consultation on changes to their pensions when they have retired.  In many cases, they have paid their contributions to these schemes for decades, they have effectively concluded a social contract on the benefits they will receive when they retire and the contributions from their former employers are part of their wages.  After all, pensions are deferred wages.  Yet, six months after these workers have retired, they are effectively denied having any say in what happens to their pension schemes and their pensions.  It is true that they can approach the Pensions Authority or the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland, but only in very limited circumstances.  Overall, retired workers who have approached these bodies have found that they do not represent them and do not alter or challenge the cuts, changes and attacks on the schemes of which they are members.  Workers have said that it feels more like a box-ticking exercise.<\/p>  <p>  That is why the right to real consultation and the right to take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, are central to this Bill.  The right of these workers to have the organisations that they have built up represent them in retirement is what this Bill is all about.  They are under no illusions that the Bill will stop future attacks on, or changes being made to, their schemes.  Their central demand is their absolute right to be consulted on any proposed changes and to be heard.  It is a case of nothing about us without us.<\/p>  <p>  The other major element of the Bill is an attempt to address the inequality to which retired workers are subject in the context of their ability to play a role on the board of trustees of their schemes.  Elected positions are often available on these boards but retired workers face huge disadvantages in seeking election, not least because it is unlikely that they will be known in the workplace following retirement and they may not have access to many of those voting.  The Bill seeks to reverse this, and reserve a position for nominated pensioner candidates in cases where there are two or more elected positions available.<\/p>  <p>  We understand this is not a perfect proposal, and indeed, will not address many of the problems faced by retired workers in this area.  For example, the board of trustees of ESB has uses an extraordinary method of selecting trustee members for election, with potential candidates being screened by the company.  This has resulted in a most serious injustice being inflicted upon retired workers.  It has seen perfectly competent and knowledgeable candidates being prevented from standing for election by the company.  Unfortunately, this Bill will not force ESB or other companies to address the issue.  However, we hope that on Committee Stage we can begin to explore the issue.  Indeed, I call on ESB to stop this blatant discrimination against retired workers who were instrumental in building the company.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to address the Government amendment.  I know, from bitter experience, the danger of the Government kicking the can down the road, but in this case, the amendment is really quite extraordinary.  At the outset, I stated that retired workers have campaigned on this issue for more than a decade.  If the Minister for Social Protection or any member of the Government had come to the gates of the D&aacute;il yesterday to meet them, they would know that many of them are in their 70s and 80s.  With the amendment, the Government is pretending that it is not opposing the Bill while delaying its progress by a year.  What is it going to do in that year?  I expect that it will consult with trade unions, employers, business groups and industrial relation bodies.  I expect that it even intends to consult the UN and NATO.  It will not consult the group that this Bill is all about, however.  There is no mention of consulting retired workers.  It is deeply ironic and insulting that the Government response to this Bill, which is about the need to consult retired workers on their pension schemes, is an amendment that will result in those retired workers and their representative groups being ignored entirely.  The Government is proposing a consultation process that will compound the insult these workers have suffered over the years.<\/p>  <p>  Let me give the Government the message the workers gave to me.  If it thinks that its proposal will be accepted by them, it is wrong.  As soon as Covid restrictions are lifted, Government Deputies will not see dozens of the workers and their representative groups at the gates of the D&aacute;il; they will see thousands of retired workers, in unity at the gates, demanding justice and the right to a voice and to representation.  They may not be worker bees, but they can sting.  Retired workers are not retired voters.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000007#F00200","speaker":"1486"},{"type":"speech","time":1625042820,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I pay tribute to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and the People Before Profit activists involved in working on this Bill.  In particular, pay tribute to the organisations of retired workers that have campaigned and fought on this issue and sought change.  There is an extremely long list of them that is too long to read out.<\/p><p>There is a crucial context to the Bill, which is often apparent in the D&aacute;il.  That context can only be described as a war on pensions.  It has been going on for a number of decades.  Defined benefit scheme after defined benefit scheme has either been scrapped or downgraded to a yellow-pack defined contribution scheme.  Three out of four defined benefit schemes have been closed, as bosses try to evade their responsibility to provide decent pensions.  The downgrading of schemes to defined contribution schemes leaves people's pensions at the mercy of the casino of the stock market  Having worked all of their lives, these workers want the right to retire in security and with knowledge of the incomes that they will receive.<\/p><p>We saw a similar reneging on the part of the Government in respect of its responsibilities when it tried to increase the pension age to 67 and then 68.  I believe it would still like to do that but was pushed back by the reaction of voters in the general election.  The Government strategy, as on so many issues, is to divide and rule.  It is a case of young versus old and public versus private.  In reality, the division in society is between the workers who created an enormous amount of the wealth in this country and who want to retire and those who benefit from that wealth.<\/p><p>Pensions are deferred wages.  The right to a decent pension when you retire is one of the great achievements of the workers movement historically.  It is also one of the great achievements of the social welfare states created in the aftermath of the Second World War.  The attack on the very concept of pensions tells us a lot about modern capitalism and the priorities of the economic system.  The truth is that we can afford decent pensions for all.  Ireland is the fifth richest country in the world and has the fifth highest number of millionaires <i>per capita<\/i>.<\/p> <p>Yet, the Government and the right-wing economic commentators claim it is a crisis that people are living longer as opposed to it being a good thing that they are living longer.  They have created an enormous amount of wealth and, therefore, they should be able to retire in comfort.<\/p> <p> The context of the Bill is that many people have found after retiring that their pension rights had been whittled away through negotiations at which they did not even have a seat at the table.  We have had cases of direct cuts to benefits, freezes and more.  They have no way to speak out, however.  Once they are out of the workplace for more than six months, they cannot even go to the WRC.  All they are demanding is the right to be consulted and to go to the WRC.  It is a very simple and reasonable demand.  They are demanding that retired workers be seen and heard when it comes to negotiations affecting their pensions.  For too long they have been locked out, their representative groups have not been included and they have had no right to take cases to the WRC or similar bodies.  This Bill from People Before Profit would fix that by giving retired workers the right to have their voices heard, putting them on a par with current workers and their unions.  It has been endorsed by retired staff associations, representing hundreds of thousands of workers as well as Age Action and the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament.<\/p> <p> The message is clear: do not gag retired workers, give them a voice.  Yesterday, retired workers gathered outside Leinster House demanding that this Bill be supported.  The Government's plan is to kick the can down the road yet again with a 12-month delay.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  We and the retired workers will not accept this stalling tactic.  The message of the protesters to the Government was clear: they may be retired workers, but they are active voters.  If the Government delays and denies this change, those people will not forget.  Having worked all their lives, they are demanding basic rights and they will not put up with being told that they must wait.<\/p> <p> I ask every Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Deputy who are thinking of supporting the Government's amendment to think again.  If they vote to delay this Bill and silence those retired workers, they had better think twice before asking them for a vote in the next election.  How those Deputies vote tonight will be a matter of public record, shared with those pensioners in their constituencies.  If they deny the pensioners a voice, they may very well vote to deny themselves the opportunity to win back their seats in the next general election.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000007#F00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625043420,"counter":32,"content":"<p>The Government would do well to heed the warnings that were given by retired workers and pensioners outside the gates of Leinster House yesterday.  It will press its amendment at its peril.  I ask the Government, even at this point, not to move the amendment, which will delay the passing of the Bill.  It was most eloquently put by one retired worker who said, \"We may no longer be worker bees, but we are still bees with a sting.\"  If the Government is in any doubt about that, it should cast its mind back to the grey army that took to the streets on the issue of medical card entitlement and the rebellion the then Government faced.  We are talking about almost 500,000 retired workers who are very angry that they have no say over cuts to their pension entitlements.<\/p>  <p>  As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, we have seen a relentless attack on pension rights generally and these workers have seen very considerable attacks on their pensions.  Defined benefit pension schemes are being closed down or moved to defined contribution schemes.  Aviation workers, for example, have lost 22.5% of their monthly incomes without any serious consultation.  Retired workers in RT&Eacute;, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na have not seen any increase in their pensions for ten to 14 years.  Many of the workers on these schemes do not qualify for the State contribution pension scheme and therefore rely on a very modest occupational pension.  Many have seen the link that previously existed between their wages when they were working and their pension entitlements severed.<\/p>  <p>  People may think that this is not an issue for them because they are not pensioners, but all of those who are working now have an interest in it because they will be pensioners at some stage and they will realise at that point how important it is to have a real say in respect of their pensions.  Of course, these workers paid for their pensions through their PRSI contributions.  They paid very considerably more than their employers did relative to what happens in most countries in Europe.  Workers here pay pretty much the same level of PRSI contributions as the average worker in Europe, but employers in this country pay about half the amount that their counterparts abroad pay.  It is often cited that people are living longer and that the pensions we have to pay people are somehow a problem, which is quite insulting to pensioners and illogical.  We should be celebrating that people live longer.  We should also remember that if employers paid the same level of PRSI contributions as their European counterparts, we would have billions of euro extra to ensure decent pensions for all pensioners in this country.<\/p>  <p>  Another important point pensioners and retired workers asked us to stress is how they believe the failure of the Government to allow them have a say over what happens to their pensions is that they believe it breaches multiple parts of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  It breaches the sections on the right to property, the right to equality before the law for everybody, the rights of the elderly and the right to good administration.  I will not go into all the details, but that is undoubtedly true.  If for no other reason than this country is supposed to be signed up to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Government should not move its amendment and should allow the Bill to pass and give pensioners the right to simply have a say and be consulted, and have the avenue of the WRC available to them if any changes to their pensions are proposed.<\/p>  <p>  The pensioners also expressed considerable disappointment that the official trade union movement, which they built, has been so quiet on this issue.  I must admit that is disappointing.  In France, when there is any attack on pensions, there are extraordinary revolts by workers and pensioners, who understand instinctively that an attack on pensions and pensioners is an attack on all workers and their rights.<\/p>  <p>  Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the Government's amendment and not defer the Bill.  If the amendment is not withdrawn, the Government will incur the wrath of the pensioners to whom I refer.  It should be under no illusion but that wrath will be very considerable for the three Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  These retired workers literally built this country.  The people who protested yesterday included public servants, nurses, Coillte workers, Bord na M&oacute;na workers, aviation workers, ESB workers and many more I do not have time to name.  These are literally the people who physically built this country.  The Government should not continue to ignore them and treat them with the disrespect with which they are being treated.  It should give them the right to have a say over their pensions or it will feel the sting of these retired workers in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000008#G00200","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1625044020,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTo delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:  \t&ldquo;D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann acknowledges and resolves that the Industrial Relations (Provisions in Respect of Pension Entitlements of Retired Workers) Bill 2021 be deemed to be read a second time this day 12 months, to allow for consultation between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, with unions and employers and the Industrial Relations bodies, which will allow for full discussion and exploration of legal and technical issues that may arise, such as increased business costs and business viability, as a result of the proposals and to consider other options for change which might be available, and which would make it more suitable for collective bargaining.&rdquo;  <\/blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and her colleagues for giving the House an opportunity to debate this issue concerning retired persons in receipt of occupational pension benefits.  This legislative proposal is premised on the idea that retired persons who are members of such schemes should be granted access to the industrial relations machinery of the State.  The rationale for this access is to ensure that retired persons are given a voice in industrial relations processes with regard to matters affecting occupational pensions and other issues.  I appreciate there is an argument that the necessity for this inclusion in collective representation is based on the belief that pension entitlements are a form of deferred wages and that any changes affecting pension schemes are unfair to the retired workers.  I fully understand that several former workers of semi-State companies feel aggrieved that they may not have received increases to their pensions in recent years.  I did not get a chance to engage yesterday with the former workers who were protesting outside Leinster House but I have received emails and phone calls on the matter and have had conversations with many such workers.  I will get a chance during the time allowed under the amendment to engage further with them on this issue.<\/p><p>The premise of ensuring that a person has a voice in matters affecting him or her is perfectly reasonable.  It is obvious that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and her colleagues have engaged extensively with retired persons and their associations in the preparation of the Bill.  I commend the Deputy on this work and on her interest in the matter.  I know the effort involved in bringing forward legislation that one believes will have a positive impact and I accept that the Deputy believes the Bill will have a positive impact.  It is clear that the proposal is attempting to address the specific concerns or, to use the legal term, the mischiefs that the representative associations have identified to the Deputy.  The Bill is an attempt to address that but the difficulty is that, as a Government, we have to look at the overall and wider picture, rather than just the individual concerns.  That is why the amendment proposes allowing time for us to tease this out and work through it.  The proposal in the amendment to allow a period of 12 months is about ensuring we can make a genuine attempt to examine the issue and engage on it with parties from across the sector.  Of course, that would involve engaging with the retired workers affected, such as those who protested yesterday and have been contacting us.  That is a natural part of the work we would do.<\/p><p>Before I touch on the proposals relating to the Pensions Act, which are a policy matter for the Minister for Social Protection, I wish to flag policy considerations in my areas of responsibility and some of the issues with which we have difficulty and concerns that we have to try to tease out and work through.  The matter is not as straightforward as just accepting the Bill, although I accept it is a genuine attempt to deal with the grievances of the retired workers in question.  Traditionally, industrial relations revolve around the relationship between workers or employees and their employers.  A trade dispute means any dispute between employers and workers which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the terms or conditions of employment or those affecting the employment of any person.  The term &quot;non-employment&quot; has been extensively considered by the courts and is understood to mean dismissal, redundancy or a person seeking employment with a given employer.  A retired person is legally understood to be retired.  In legal terms, a person cannot have a dual designation of &quot;worker&quot; and &quot;retired&quot; at the same time.  A person is one or the other and a retired worker cannot actively be involved in a trade dispute involving matters of employment and non-employment.  This legislative proposal would introduce a novel element and change to this established tradition and, as such, it needs to be fully examined and investigated and worked through.<\/p><p>Industrial relations disputes involve a totality of the terms and conditions of existing workers, matters which, in the main, do not affect retired persons.  The policy underlying industrial relations dispute resolution mechanisms in Ireland is to maintain industrial harmony and to ensure fairness in workplaces.  A concern that my Department has to work through is that the inclusion of a third category of participants to trade disputes, with narrow singular interests in the collective bargaining process, may distort the interests of those parties for whom the process was originally designed.  The inclusion of a third party to such negotiations may deter legitimate parties involved in the trade dispute from agreeing to engage in dispute resolution processes in the first place.  This could have the unintended consequence of undermining the overall policy rationale for industrial harmony.  I know that certainly is not something Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith wishes to do.  I am not saying it is what she is trying to do; I am just saying these are the issues about which we have concerns and have to try to work out.<\/p><p>We must acknowledge that currently there is no legal obligation on any employer to offer a pension scheme to its staff.  The introduction of a legal entitlement for retired persons to have a seat at the negotiating table because of said pension entitlement might make occupational pension schemes a less attractive proposition for employers.  I know that is not something the Deputy wishes to encourage and we would not like to see it happen either.  It is not a desirable policy prospect and I am sure it is not something that any Member of this House intends to bring about.  I am not saying Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith intends to do so; I am just flagging the issues that have to be addressed.<\/p><p>It has already been recognised that there is legitimacy, in time-limited circumstances, for retired persons to seek redress from the industrial relations bodies.  In 2015, the Industrial Relations Acts were amended through the insertion of section 26A to the 1990 Act.  It allows a retired person to access the industrial relations bodies for a period of six months post retirement in respect of matters arising pre-retirement.  This six-month timeframe within which to make a complaint for matters arising post retirement commences on the date of retirement or the date on when the grievance became known or ought to have become known.  Section 26A was inserted into the 1990 Act to address the injustice whereby persons were unable to address work-related issues that may have come to light only after retirement, even though they related to matters that had arisen pre-retirement.  It ought to be noted that there are exceptional circumstances in which the Labour Court will extend the six-month time limit associated with the date of retirement on a case-by-case basis where the justice of the case so requires.  That is a decision it can make.<\/p><p>The second policy area within my remit relates to the Trade Union Acts, which provide for the licensing of bodies carrying on negotiations relating to fixing wages and other conditions of employment.  My Department and I have a concern with the drafting in the Bill that appears to suggest that an entity purporting to represent the ill-defined category of &quot;retired worker&quot;, who may very well be actual workers, could rely on the exemption to the requirement for a negotiating licence and ability to refer disputes relating to occupational pension terms to the industrial relations machinery of the State to seek access to public service pay negotiations.  Such entities have no role in the determination of the terms and conditions of public service employees or the negotiation of any aspect of pay or remuneration.  Any unintentional consequence of such an exemption needs to be addressed and worked through.  I am again flagging our concerns in this regard.<\/p><p>As regards the proposed amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, scheme trustees already have duties and responsibilities under trust law, the Pensions Act 1990, as amended, and other relevant legislation.  The duties of pension scheme trustees include administering the scheme in accordance with the law and the terms of the trust deed and scheme rules, as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements that apply to these schemes.  Trustees must act in the best financial interest of all scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially.  Although section 62 of the 1990 Act, or the regulations made under that section, do not currently specifically provide that member trustees must include at least one pensioner member or provide that member trustees must include one or more active members, they do provide an opportunity for such membership by either cohort and pensioner members may avail of that opportunity to become scheme trustees or nominate others to act on their behalf.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment in section 10 of the Bill appears to give a guarantee of preferential treatment, in the elections for trustees, of pensioner member candidates where such candidates have been nominated.  However, as I have stated, the position is that those appointed as trustees have a fiduciary duty to represent all members, be they active, deferred or pensioner, of a scheme impartially and to act in the best financial interests of all members.  If there is a conflict of interest, then a person&rsquo;s duty as a trustee must take precedence over other interests.  Accordingly, any trustee who acts in the interests of pensioner members above the interests of another cohort of the scheme would be in breach of this fiduciary duty.<\/p><p>The proposed amendment does not provide for any guaranteed selection or appointment in respect of other scheme cohorts and, therefore, the preferential treatment of pensioner members provided by this proposed amendment could be viewed as inequitable and discriminatory.  Again, I am sure that is not something Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith would like to see happening.  If this proposal was accepted as it is currently drafted, the effect of the proposed amendment at section 10 could result in a preponderance of pensioner members being selected to the trustee board, to the exclusion of other member cohorts.  I assume that is not the intended outcome.<\/p><p>Regulations made under section 62 of the Pensions Act are subject to section 59A of the 1990 Act, which has been recently amended to require that trustees must satisfy good repute and integrity requirements on an individual basis, and qualifications, knowledge and experience requirements on a collective basis.  Accordingly, any amendment to section 62 or to the 1990 Act in general, must be considered with the recent amendments to that Act in mind.  Any guarantee in respect of the selection or appointment of pensioner trustees would have to be framed in such a manner as to ensure such pensioner trustees will satisfy those requirements as, otherwise, such a person, or the trustees as a whole, may be in breach of section 59A of the 1990 Act.<\/p> <p>With the foregoing, the Government requires more detailed analysis and consultation about this legislative proposal.  The Bill introduces amendments that have wider consequences than those stated for the target audience.  These must be carefully considered but the Government is willing to look at these issues.  As I stated at the outset, I understand this is a genuine attempt to correct certain concerns.  The Government, however, has a duty to take into account the wider picture and fully interrogate this legislation.  We are prepared to do that.  I hope the Members opposite will accept our amendment to give us time to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000009#H00100","speaker":"1505","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625044620,"counter":35,"content":"<p>Before I take up some of the points made by the Minister of State, will a copy of his speech be distributed to the Deputies in the House in order that we can look at it before the close of the debate itself?<\/p>  <p>  A key point the Minister of State tried to make was that there are various interest groups involved, namely, employers on the one hand and employees on the other.  He then introduced a third category, that of retired workers.  We would argue that in reality the interests of workers and the interests of retired workers are one in the same.  They should not be treated for the purposes of this debate as two separate categories.  Retired workers are part of the workers' movement and they have common interests with people who are currently in employment.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister of State made the point that occupational pension schemes are optional and that, if retired workers are given rights in the process, it could scare off employers from initiating and participating in schemes with the result that workers would have to pay more.  A simple remedy is that the Minister of State no longer makes occupational pension schemes optional but makes them compulsory and makes it a duty of an employer to participate in them.<\/p>  <p>  Points were raised towards the end of the Minister of State's contribution about a situation where there would be more trustees representing retired workers disproportionately as opposed to workers who are currently in employment.  I do not necessarily see that situation arising.  That is an issue that can be teased out on Committee Stage.  It is not a reason for delaying the passage of this Bill for 12 months.<\/p>  <p>  Last, but far from least, the Government has asked for more time.  The Minister of State said it needed another year to tease these points out, as though this was a new issue that arrived on the scene yesterday or the day before.  These are issues that have been knocking on the door for more than ten years.  The Government has had more than ten years to address them.  Now it is trying to kick the can down the road for another year.  The ESB workers have already had their pay frozen for 11 years, while RT&Eacute; workers have had theirs frozen for 13 years.  However, the Minister of State is asking for more time.  A cynic looking at the lines of argument the Minister of State is putting forward might think he is trying to kick the can down the road until such time as the majority of the country's retired workers have passed away and that will resolve the issue.  We are not going to allow that to be the case.  More importantly, the retired workers and their organisations will not allow that.<\/p>  <p>  The amendment should be withdrawn.

There can be no more delays on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is also open to a reasonable charge of hypocrisy on these issues.  The gold-plated pensions of Ministers and the extraordinarily generous pension arrangements for all Deputies are one thing.  Workers in occupational pension schemes, however, have to deal with a different scenario.  One former leader of this country, Bertie Ahern, draws down &euro;135,000 a year in pensions.  I suspect he draws down more than that because that figure was the last information we could get before the blackout curtains came down on this area in 2016.

The figure I will mention is the &euro;10 million paid out in political pensions in 2018 alone.  It is one rule for Ministers and Deputies and another rule for the pensioners in question.  The retired workers in question are the people who have played a key role in and contributed more to the building of this country.  I challenge Members to name one group who has contributed more to the building of this country than have retired workers.  There is none.  There are positives and negatives in this country.  On the positive side of the balance book, in terms of what has been contributed, built up and passed on to the next generation, there is no group that has contributed more than the retired workers.<\/p>  <p>  However, they were a convenient punchbag for conservative Governments led by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and participated in by the Green Party and the Labour Party, in the austerity years.  They were made the whipping boys and girls of austerity by the taking of the knife to the defined benefit schemes, three quarters of which have now gone.  It was done by promoting the cheapskate defined contribution schemes, by ending the index link between pensions and the rise of wages within society and by putting forward the phoney argument that this is necessary because of demographic changes.  Capitalism is a system that is in crisis and decline.  A system developing and expanding in a healthy way would be able to accommodate the demographic changes without enormous bother while providing for decent pensions and decent increases for people who have contributed so much to society.  Instead, these pensioners have had their pensions frozen, as per the examples referred to earlier, or in many other cases actually cut.<\/p>  <p>  I want to echo the point that it is a shame and scandal that the leadership of the trade union movement has allowed that to happen without opposing or resisting it or without making a fight on the issue.  That could and should have been done.  It is a disgrace it has not been done to date.  Instead, the Government is trying to infantilise the pensioners in question.  These people are responsible members of society who have raised families.  Many of them are grandparents but yet, one would not treat a child this way.  They have no say on their pension scheme whatsoever.  The decisions will be made over their heads.  There is no seat for a pensioner whatsoever at the table.  The decisions will be made for them.  This is an attempt to infantilise a generation of people who built this country up.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  They are a large group of people, however.  There are nearly 500,000 workers in occupational pension schemes.  They will be ignored at the Government's peril.  They are ex-workers but not ex-voters.  They have shown in the past what they can do when they use their muscle.  They showed what they could do when they took to the streets when there was an attempt to take the medical cards from the over-70s.  They showed what they could do in the last general election.<\/p> <p>Like a bolt from the blue, an issue that had been beneath the radar emerged above the surface and put the establishment parties of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael under huge pressure.  This was the cuts to the State pension and the attempt to raise its qualifying age from 65 to 66, 67 or 68, which they agreed among themselves.  It was a bolt from the blue that strongly hit those parties in the general election.  The grey panthers had a real impact on that general election and will have a real impact on the next election, as well as before it in terms of the pressure that can and will be exerted if the Government continue to play them for fools.  <\/p> <p> The Government is in the last chance saloon on this issue.  I ask the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment and allow the Bill to pass Second Stage tonight.  If there are issues with it, and I have no doubt there are, they can be teased out on Committee Stage. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000010#J00600","speaker":"1522","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625045220,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this important legislation.  It gives us a good opportunity to have a discussion about both pensions in general and a specific group of former workers.  As has been pointed out, they might be former workers but they most definitely are not former voters.<\/p>  <p>  I have some experience of dealing with occupational pension schemes from my previous employment.  It always struck me that it is very tough to get people interested in a pension scheme, in being trustees or being active in it, when they are 25 years old because they think retirement might never happen.  It is something that happens to other people and just does not really interest or excite people.  Unfortunately for many pension schemes, the only time people get seriously interested is when they are actually looking at retirement and, therefore, there can sometimes be a disproportionate focus on a group of workers who are nearer to retirement, which can have a detrimental impact on retirees, deferred pensioners and, indeed, younger workers.  I will use some of my time to encourage any people who have an occupational pension scheme in their workplace to take the time to get involved in it and not wait until they are close to benefiting from it.  <\/p>  <p>  I come from a trade union and activist background and one of our mantras or mottoes was always, \"Nothing about us without us\".  Yet there are groups of pensioners and former workers who have decisions taken for them, not just about their pension schemes but about the money they have.  These are people on a fixed income who are excluded from decisions taken.  As we can see from the level of support from the various associations, they want to be included and actively involved as part of this process but they are effectively excluded.  These workers do not have a choice so everything about them is without them because they have no say, are absolutely voiceless and yet are impacted by decisions that are taken.<\/p>  <p>  I take it from the Minister of State's speech that there is, at the very least, recognition on the part of the Government that this situation needs to be addressed.  I do not understand why there is a need to kick this issue down the road.  The legislation can be taken as it is now.  Sinn F&eacute;in support it, which is not to say we would not propose amendments to strengthen it or that we would not want to work with the sponsors to ensure any issues that might arise can be addressed.  However, the Government is saying there is an issue but it needs a year to think about it.  Surely that time would be more productively spent engaging with this legislation, amending it as necessary, having that debate and having the opportunity on Committee Stage to invite retired members in to give them a voice.  They do not have a voice.  That is why we are having this debate, to give them that voice and opportunity to be involved in what is, essentially, their income and the money they rely on to buy their groceries, pay their rent, in some cases, and their mortgages, as well as to keep body and soul together etc.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government knows this is a pattern but I do not understand why, when the Opposition suggests something, the Government says, \"That would be the right thing to do but let us not just do that right now, let us just wait\".  Everything is either not opposed but not supported or kicked down the road for a year.  I appreciate that.  I read in the newspaper, just as did everybody else, of the discussions that took place at a parliamentary party meeting for one of the Government parties, where it was said they did not want to be known as the nasty party.  This is not going to help that, however, because these retired workers are not stupid.  They read the newspapers and will watch this debate.  They see what happens.  The Government says that it needs to do something but will just not do it now.  <\/p>  <p>  I encourage the Government to withdraw its amendment.  I also encourage any retired workers who are members of an occupational pension scheme to engage with Deputies in their area who are opposing this because if it is being kicked down the road, that is effectively what is being done.  They should engage with those Deputies who are saying \"not now\", encourage them to support it and make their voices heard.  This legislation essentially addresses the fact that their voices are absent from a very important aspect of their lives.  Once again, I thank the Deputies for bringing forward this legislation.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it and I encourage the Government to withdraw its amendment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000011#K00200","speaker":"1467"},{"type":"speech","time":1625045220,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I remember in the run-up to the election last year queueing at a funeral in Abbeydorney and seeing an election poster on the street.

As was pointed out by colleagues today and last week, it is simply unfair that workers are obliged to retire at 65 years of age on a jobseeker's rate of &euro;203.  This is below the poverty line in a State with the second highest cost of living in Europe, where food and utility bills are high and where in rural areas, the cost of maintaining, keeping and paying for a car is driving people further into poverty.<\/p><p>Contrast that with the pensions of some recently retired Fine Gael members who left this House before the age of 50.  Did the parties that formed the Government not hear the voices of the electorate or the people standing in line at the funeral in Abbeydorney who said loud and clear that this is not acceptable?  Retirement should be a time to relax with grandchildren in economic comfort as a reward for working for many years, which allows you to contribute in other ways to the economic and social life of our towns and villages.

CE schemes throughout the country were to the fore in responding to the Covid crisis by helping with the Community Call and many other matters.

There are approximately 500,000 pensioners in the country and they are understandably very eager to see the legislation pass.  This is not just about their rights, however, it is also about future generations, given that every worker will inevitably make the transition from current to former at some point in their lives.  Pensioners are men and women who have given a life's work in our public, semi-State and private sectors.  They are our mothers and fathers, our grandmothers and grandfathers and they have been given fewer rights to self-determine their incomes and livelihoods simply by virtue of their age.<\/p>  <p>  We cannot expect generations to work hard and build a strong economy and society to the benefit of everyone, and then simply move the goalposts of what the fruit of that labour looks like.  These people have worked hard all their lives with the intention of securing a firm pension and a stable retirement, only to find themselves precluded from making decisions that change the size and conditions of their pension funds.  For many retirees, these pension funds are their sole form of income.  That current workers can avail of the WRC services by filing a complaint or appeal about an industrial relations grievance, while pensioners cannot, is completely unacceptable.  At present, only individual pensioners have access to any form of redress and that is only up to six months after they retire.  The Bill will rectify this discrepancy and other anomalies in outdated legislation.<\/p>  <p>  Occupational pensioners have up to now been completely at the mercy of changes made to their pension schemes, without an opportunity to sit at the decision-making table, an opportunity for self-representation in consultation procedures or an opportunity for recourse.  This injustice is symptomatic of a wider cultural attitude of dismissiveness towards our ageing and elderly population.  The elderly have, on more than one occasion, been first at the guillotine in the context of cost-cutting exercises relating to State services and welfare supports when austerity measures were cyclically introduced and the economy was struggling.  That is totally unfair.  There needs to be more balance between present and former workers' rights.  We need to ensure retired workers will be respected to the same extent as current workers, even though their service has ended.

It must be based on equality in closing the gender gap as part of any pension reforms.  The Bill follows a simple universal rule, namely, that we should treat others as we would wish to be treated ourselves.  This is certainly not the case for those with a private or semi-State pension, for whom the mantra is \"eaten bread is soon forgotten\".  Thousands of retired workers have given the best part of their lives to these companies, helping them to build and innovate for the future, yet at present they have no outlet for communication, no method of being represented, no input into negotiations and no say as to what happens to their pension schemes.<\/p>  <p>  I have been contacted by many retired ESB workers who have experienced much the same treatment regarding their pension scheme.

I support the proposal to strengthen the rights of workers who have retired and their organisations and to provide that they be consulted when there are proposed changes to the scheme that will affect their lives.  It is entirely reasonable to ask that organisations working on behalf of workers be permitted to take cases to the WRC, and that the period in which those cases can be taken will be extended to six months after a dispute has arisen rather than six months after the worker has retired.

He stated that such people do not have much time in their tanks and that while a further 12 months may seem a short time to some, it is a long time for retired folks.  He went on to state that because they all still have votes, they can make a difference at the ballot box and may choose to vote for those who will protect their rights and not take them away.  Obviously, Michael has on many occasions watched proceedings in the House and has recently seen the Government's tactic of accepting a proposal, letting it pass and claiming it agrees with it while, at the same time, kicking the can down the road.<\/p> <p>Maybe they are thinking that the Government might not be here in 12 months either.

This could be done in the normal course of events.<\/p><p>The Bill is worthy of support.  It is measured and it simply gives retired workers access to the Workplace Relations Commission in situations where their pension scheme is being changed, which is not unreasonable.  They currently have no representation.  There is a definite gap in the law because it allows unscrupulous business owners to make millions in profit while leaving pension funds underfunded, which is one example.<\/p><p>We have met groups of public sector retirees who have very legitimate grievances.  Older public sector workers did not pay regular PRSI and do not have an entitlement to the State pension, so they do not benefit from budget reviews and increases in the pension rate.  Their public sector pensions do not rise with the cost of living so their value is being eroded.  The pension funds were &ldquo;raided&rdquo; post-2008 and were never restored, which resulted in cuts in real terms to their pensions.  While most of these cuts were restored, there was no compensation for the lost years and those on the highest pensions remain with lower pensions.<\/p><p>The retired semi-State staff association emerged from the post-2008 scenario when groups of retirees were encouraged to come together under one umbrella.  Groups like that, which are supporting the promulgation of this legislation, have legitimacy.  It is important to recognise the legitimacy of this cohort of people and all of the stakeholders who are supporting this Bill because they represent tens of thousands of workers.  That needs to be acknowledged.  As far as I can see, the large stakeholder grouping does not attach to one political party or ideological association and, in fact, I suggest that very many of these workers would have traditionally voted for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  That is why we feel strongly that the Bill should progress through the D&aacute;il at this stage.  This is a broad coalition of stakeholders that reflects what is happening in society.  People have a real-time loss of income and they merely wish to have representation and for that representation to be recognised in law.  That is not unreasonable.<\/p><p>Cynically, one could say that, like any issue that affects an historical cohort, there is a reflex within the Government and sometimes within the Civil Service, dare I say it, and I say it is a former Minister of State, to hold tight because the calculation is that this generation will pass on and, as the issue does not affect middle aged or younger people, the Government will try to put it on the long finger.  I speak with objectivity because that is precisely what is happening with this legislation.  It is being put on the long finger and it is a <i>de facto<\/i>attempt by the Government to kill it off in the long run.  I do not think that is to anybody's benefit, particularly given the range and breadth of the stakeholder group that is involved in supporting the legislation.  They are reflective of all sectors of society.  We must always remember that the principle of intergenerational solidarity has to apply.  There must be that solidarity between retired former workers and current workers, and this Bill seeks to support that principle.<\/p><p>We strongly support the Bill and we ask that the Government revise its decision to delay its passage.  We ask the Government, in principle, to stop using this tool.  It used to be the guillotine and now it is the six-month or 12-month delay tactic that is being used as the effective tool of Government to stymie legislation that is proposed by Members on the Opposition benches.  To be frank, the tens of thousands of workers, who are watching these proceedings in the hope that the Government would at least allow the Bill to pass Second Stage and go to Committee Stage, so all of the issues raised by the Minister of State, Deputy English, can be addressed, see the tactic for what it is.  Let us call a spade a spade: it is an attempt by the Government to kick the can down the line and kill it off, if it can.

The Social Democrats are very aware of the many groups and individuals who have worked over many years on the issues raised in the Bill.  There are many organisations involved and they have made a very convincing case in regard to protecting their pension rights.  It is very clear that the groups behind this Bill want to ensure that the voice of pensioners is heard loud and clear when decisions are made which affect pensioners.  These groups and organisations represent a wide range of people from different sectors, and they have paid into pension schemes throughout their working lives.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, pensioners in receipt of occupational pensions have experienced the impact of FEMPI.  In many cases which have been highlighted, pensioners have not experienced the benefit of an increase in their pension for a decade or more.  We have seen the closure of some occupational pension schemes, which has had a serious impact on people whose incomes were affected.  These occupational pensions can be understood as deferred wages so, when a person&rsquo;s income in retirement does not keep pace with what he or she expected, that person has a very legitimate grievance.<\/p>  <p>  Currently, people with an issue relating to their pensions can use the offices of the Pensions Authority or the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, but those options are only available to pensioners as individuals.  What pensioners are seeking is an opportunity to have a seat at the table when decisions are being made which affect them collectively.  Employers are very well used to the industrial relations machinery of the State, and the Workplace Relations Commission in particular.  Employers, including the State, deal collectively with employees all of the time through negotiations with unions.  Changes in terms and conditions, pay and other issues affecting working life are addressed at the Workplace Relations Commission, day in, day out.<\/p>  <p>Pensioners are looking for avenues to deal with their issues collectively.  They want a seat at the table before decisions are made and an avenue to effectively pursue their grievances. <\/p> <p> One of the issues the Social Democrats are particularly concerned about is that of pension provision for retired women.  There is a huge amount of work to be done to rebalance the lives of women in retirement.  Women who have been out of the workplace for a number of years often feel the impact of that on their income when they retire.  Many women, particularly those in jobs and professions which are traditionally female dominated, want to be in a position to seek fair pensions and proper income in retirement.  This is an issue that transcends this Bill, but one successive Governments have refused to address.  <\/p> <p> The Bill before us would allow retired workers' organisations to be consulted when changes to members' pension schemes are proposed.  It would allow these organisations to take cases to the WRC, and it would also strengthen the ability of retired members to become members of the board of trustees of pension schemes.  It changes the definition of a trade dispute to include matters affecting retired workers' benefits under occupational pension schemes.  The Social Democrats support this Bill and we appeal to all members to, at least, allow it to go forward to Committee Stage where the issues can be further teased out. <\/p> <p> Pensioners have been under pressure.  I will use this opportunity to raise a number of issues that are highly relevant and to which the Government needs to respond as a matter of urgency.  The Social Democrats have pointed out that legislation to prevent employers who have adequate financial resources to meet the commitments in their occupational pension schemes from walking away is badly needed.  We see the issues here in the context of pension justice.  Pensioner poverty in general needs to be addressed.  Fuel poverty blights far too many homes in Ireland.  The level of pensioner poverty acceptable is zero.  The budget this year will be an opportunity for the Government to address issues affecting pensioners. <\/p> <p> I again pay tribute to the many groups and organisations that have supported this Bill and campaigned for it.  I make it very clear that this is a cross-generational issue.  We often hear terms like \"pensions timebomb\" or \"pensions crisis\".  At times, there are attempts by commentators to pit one group in society against another.  We cannot create a society of winners and losers.  We have to acknowledge that solidarity across generations matters.  There are many people of working age whose only income in retirement will be the State pension.  The Zurich Life survey from 2020 showed the extent of the challenge in this area.  Almost two thirds of those surveyed said they were concerned about not having enough money for their retirement.  Irish Life figures in 2017 showed that just 46% of working adults had a company pension plan available to them.  The workers of today are the pensioners of tomorrow.  The pensioners of today are the workers of yesterday.  Everyone in society has an interest in pensions justice.  <\/p> <p> The work being done by the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament and others is vital to protect the pension rights of all workers.  As the representatives from the National Association of Pensioners, the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and the ESB Retired Staff Association so eloquently outlined in their presentation on the Bill yesterday, pensioners need channels to effectively address the myriad of issues that have arisen and are affecting their incomes.  I hope the Government parties get this message loud and clear.  On behalf of the Social Democrats, I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and the staff who worked with her in putting forward this Bill.  The Social Democrats will be supporting it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000013#M00300","speaker":"1627","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625047020,"counter":53,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to support this Bill which seeks to address an issue that potentially affects a large proportion of our population, especially those of a particular age.  When people retire, particularly from large organisations in which there are many hundreds of employees, they can effectively become ghosts overnight.  As long as they are still working, they have a voice, their grievances can be heard and they have avenues to challenge decisions that affect them, but once they retire they lose that voice.  Decisions that can greatly impact on the quality of their lives can be made without any consultation with them.  If they feel they have been wronged, they no longer have a platform to air that grievance and no opportunity to challenge those decisions.  This must create a feeling of frustration and helplessness for people who may already be struggling with a different kind of life away from the workplace.<\/p>  <p>  People on pensions also need security and to know that their income, which is much reduced from what they were taking home when working, will not be cut overnight, leaving them in financial difficulty with no means of making up that gap.  In the past, I met the retired employees of the ESB in Galway whose pensions have been frozen for a dozen years, a decision in respect of which they were given no say when it was being made, and they still have no say in having that decision reversed.  One of the men I met contacted me again recently and told me that he had paid pension contributions for the 43 years he had worked with the company and that his pension is now less than what it was 12 years ago when he retired.  There are many others in similar situations, and in other organisations too.  For example, last year hundreds of employees of Aer Lingus and the Dublin Airport Authority, lost a High Court challenge to cuts to their pensions.  These are people who worked all of their lives and these decisions were taken without any reference to them.  These decisions directly affect their standard of living.  In the future, they must be given a voice in regard to changes to their pension conditions, in the same way as those who are still working have to be consulted in regard to proposed changes to their pay and conditions.<\/p>  <p>  Last December, the Cabinet reversed pension cuts to retired Taoisigh, Ministers and senior civil servants who were in office during the financial crisis a decade ago.  There is little chance of that happening for the retirees of the companies to which I referred.  It is important that, into the future, people who retire have a say when it comes to decisions on reductions in their pensions.

This Bill strengthens the rights of retired workers regarding their occupational pension schemes and covers issues arising from any proposed changes to these schemes after a worker has left the employment concerned and retired.  The Bill does this by providing for retired workers' organisations to be consulted in the case of proposed changes to members' and pension schemes' entitlements and, further, to permit these organisations to take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission.

This company has been successful and profitable over the past ten years and more, with operating profits averaging &euro;533 million per annum in that period.  However, during this successful period, the ESB has consistently discriminated against pensioners, denied them a pension increase and <i>pro rata<\/i>representation on the governing bodies of the ESB pension scheme.

I appreciate the forbearance of the Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach and the Rural Independent Group.  One of the problems here is that Government Deputies are not taking their slots, which has pushed back the slots for Opposition Deputies.  As a result, the timing is very hard to manage.<\/p>  <p>  Pensions should be sacrosanct in Irish society.  Pensioners and people approaching pension age should have complete confidence in their pensions.  Pensions are very important for a number of reasons.  Typically, when people reach pension age their income is likely to fall, they will be under severe pressure and they need to have the confidence that allows them to live their lives to the full extent.  The problem has been made worse in recent times because many people have plugged themselves into mortgages that extend beyond pension age.  In addition, the housing crisis and the Government&rsquo;s housing policies mean many people are now paying very high rents when they reach pension age.<\/p>  <p>  Pension stability and confidence in pensions are very important.  The fact that the Government has played politics with pensions in recent years is incredible.  When the last crash happened, one of the first steps the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government took was to raid pensioners' pockets in order to pay for the massive economic bill that arose.  In the past year, we had an &euro;18 billion giveaway budget and it is equally incredible that Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party could not find as much as a tenner for pensioners.<\/p>  <p>  In the next 40 years, we will see radical change in respect of the demographic structure of the State.  What is never really discussed is the fact that productivity is rapidly increasing over time.  While there are fewer people to pay for every pension, productivity levels are higher. <\/p>  <p>  A report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, in July 2020 showed there was a burgeoning crisis in respect of pension poverty in this State.  The report detailed that when one looks at the household disposable income of those just about to reach pension age, between 50% and 60% are at risk of having an inadequate income in their retirement years.  It sounds like something from the 1920s or 1930s that we live in a society in which people are facing the prospect of having an inadequate income in their golden years, the time they need it most.  A major factor, according to the ESRI report, in being prepared for retirement in monetary terms was non-pension wealth, which includes cash savings, second homes, etc.  How can working men and women be expected to amass non-pension wealth when the country is caught in an endless cycle of boom and bust?  People are expected to provide extra income for themselves outside of what the Government is talking about but it is virtually impossible to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Just under six in ten Irish workers have some form of pension supplementing the State&rsquo;s PRSI pension.  With more new homeowners opting for 34-year mortgages, it is very difficult to ensure that people have the right level of income.  The Government has been talking about auto-enrolment pensions for some time.  It is saying now that it will provide a contribution equal to 1.5% of salary, rising to 6% after ten years of work.  I ask this Minister of State, as I have asked other Ministers previously, what progress has been made on that front.<\/p>  <p> On a final note, the Taoiseach said last week that the Government was putting in place incentives for elderly homeowners to downsize in order to free up homes for younger families.<\/p> <p>Rather than building more homes to try to allow for younger families to get a roof over their heads, the Government is talking about pushing many pensioners out of their homes.  Homes are more than just bricks and mortar for these pensioners.  These homes are the places where their children were born, where the children grew up, where their memories are and where they have laid out loved ones who have died.  They are exceptionally important places for these pensioners in their lives.  In addition, those homes plug them into the communities that support them during their pension age.  It is wrong for the Government to point the finger at pensioners for the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000015#O00600","speaker":"1504","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625048220,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and People Before Profit-Solidarity for introducing this retired workers Bill.  I am very pleased to support the legislation, which would represent an important change for the up to 500,000 retired workers in this country.  Many workers have had detrimental changes made to their pension entitlements with little notice and no consultation.  These changes could mean a cut to their pension entitlements, a freeze for up to ten years in some cases or the breaking of the link between pay and pension entitlement.  For example, in 2013 An Post proposed new funding proposals for its scheme, which had a very significant deficit at the time.  These proposals included a pension salary cap for class A PRSI staff.  These were extremely complicated issues which could lead to lower pension payments for these retired members.  Another issue is that the minimum of 30 days' notice was not given to the workers.  When Aer Lingus was sold in 2014 and 2015, 600 workers on deferred pensions were set to lose out in a change from defined benefits to defined contributions.  Those workers asked for &euro;15 million from the sale to be donated to a fund for deferred pensions.  They were ignored and some workers received cuts of 50% to 60% to their deferred pensions.  Shamefully, those workers had to go to the point of bringing their case to the High Court.  The case was heard last year and the judge made a decision that the pensioners' constitutional property rights were not breached by section 32B of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1988 because reductions they complained of were made under amendments to the Pensions Act, which they had not challenged.  No worker should have to go as far as the High Court to get his or her pension entitlement sorted out.<\/p>  <p>  Pension schemes are complicated.  You would need to be both an accountant and a lawyer to understand them and even then you might not fully understand them.  An individual pensioner has not a hope.  Pensioners need legislation to be able to employ those with the necessary skills to represent them.  This is the first important change in the Bill.  It would give pensioners' associations and organisations the same rights as employers and unions under the Industrial Relations Act.  Such associations and organisations would be able to take cases relating to pensions to the WRC.  Another important change proposed in the Bill is to the six-month time limit for a retired worker to bring a case to the WRC.  The Bill clarifies the time from when the worker retired to six months from the time the pension dispute arose.  The Bill will also allow the WRC to review codes of practice relevant to retired workers to take into account in such a review the position of retired workers' associations and organisations.  Finally, the Bill makes provision to ensure that retired scheme members have strengthened rights when an election is to take place for two or more vacancies on the trustee board.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State not to delay this by 12 months.  I ask him to bring this legislation into Committee Stage and to start the process and the consultation with the various groups concerned.  This has been ten years in the making, during which time retired workers have sought changes in order that they have representation.  These are the same workers who did not receive the PUP during the pandemic.  There are also workers who do not have secure housing for older people.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government not to press their amendment to the motion but rather to bring the Bill into Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000016#P00200","speaker":"1569"},{"type":"speech","time":1625048220,"counter":64,"content":"<p>I am especially pleased to speak on this Bill and to support it.  I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and all the organisations that worked on the Bill.  There are many reasons to support the Bill but I will highlight two.  First, this legislation would give a group of retired workers some rights when it comes to making decisions relating to their pensions.  As one person who emailed me said, the Bill is not revolutionary but will go some way towards correcting a historical injustice to thousands of retired workers.  It will give them a voice at the table.  As she said, they are asking for a right to be consulted, a right to representation and a right to be at the table when decisions are taken about their pensions.  These are very reasonable asks and, as my correspondent said, are not revolutionary.<\/p>  <p>  The second reason I am especially pleased to get the opportunity to speak on the Bill is that this very same issue was raised with me when I was a Member of the European Parliament.  Despite my tabling questions to the Commission and checking the legislation, there was and is no European legislation that would cover this situation specifically.  Of course, one of the main reasons for that is that member states organise their own pension systems, and that is the case in the context of what we are speaking about today.  While there is some European legislation that protects the rights of citizens if they move from one member state to another; while we have legislation that was enacted this year on what we call institutions for occupational retirement provision, IORP, schemes; and while I was really pleased to have an opportunity to have an influence on that legislation, on this issue I could do nothing.  From a personal perspective, therefore, I am pleased Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith has brought forward this legislation, which seeks to address this specific issue and I am delighted to get an opportunity to speak to it.<\/p>  <p>  An astonishing number of people have had their legitimate expectations whipped from under their noses and they stand powerless because they have no say and no way of influencing or making any changes.  That is wrong, and this Bill sets out to right that wrong.  I see the Government is not opposing it.  That is positive and shows that this legislation is needed and that a historic injustice needs to be addressed.  However, 12 months is far too long because this situation has pertained for far too long, with some workers having seen a reduction of over 20% to their pensions, some seeing their pensions frozen for 14 years.  This is an urgent matter and needs to be dealt with urgently.  It is a fairly simple, straightforward proposal and, like any proposal, could benefit from amendments, but that is not an issue.  What we want to see is that pensioners can get their rights and that as citizens - they are no longer workers - they cannot be subject to unilateral action on their pensions where they have no voice and no say.  As I said, while I accept the Government is not opposed to this legislation, if a situation is wrong and discriminatory, then kicking the can down the road will make it worse.  Action is needed now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000016#P00300","speaker":"1605"},{"type":"speech","time":1625048220,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I thank all the contributors to the debate.  I am sorry I had to step out for some of it.  I did not get to hear all the speeches but I did hear the ones at the start.  I have an understanding of what the Deputies are trying to achieve with the legislation and I accept that it is a genuine effort.  Others made speeches that covered a wide range of areas but did not focus on the legislation or the situation that as a Government we are trying to deal with.  That is why we have asked for time in the amendment to consider the technicalities of this and the processes involved.  As usual, however, the debate went in different directions.  On that, I need to correct Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  He is trying to cause another concern for older people.  What the Taoiseach said last week was that many people are not in appropriate houses that suit their needs as they get older and that there is an opportunity to provide them with more suitable houses.  I would use the term \"right-sizing\".<\/p> <p>Much work was done on that by the last Government across different Departments, supported by many in this House, of an approach that first tries to keep people in their existing home, where possible.  There are supports, grants, and other structures available to achieve that.  For others, it is a better outcome to move into a more appropriate house that is designed for their needs, that has security, and so on.  That has worked extremely well, because many housing associations and groups of people have come together all over the country and brought forward some lovely proposals.  The Taoiseach referred to the opportunity to do more of that.  That is what we want to do.  It is not true to say that the Taoiseach wants to force anybody out of his or her house, or that he blames any older or ageing person for the housing crisis.  It is unfair to say that in this House, but it is typical of the Deputy, who tries to cause consternation over something that is not true.  However, we need to have a genuine and focused conversation on the needs of people who are ageing, on where they want to live, and on where they hope to live in the future.  We recognise it is getting more costly if you do not own our own home.  Some 85% of people in that age brackets own their own homes, but a high percentage does not.  It can be difficult if rents are high.  It is important that the State is involved in the provision of housing for those who are ageing.  That is what the work has been about over the last couple of years.<\/p> <p> I touched on some of the concerns the Government has with the Bill earlier and I went through them in detail.  I was genuinely trying to set out some of our concerns and the work that needs to be done over the next six to 12 months.  That is why we asked for time amendment on this.  I accept there is a genuine effort in this legislation to deal with the concerns of people who were protesting yesterday and who have been engaging with us over the last couple of years.<\/p> <p> Apart from some of the issues that I mentioned earlier on, the Private Members' Bill seems to accept the premise that pension rights are somehow exposed or at risk simply because they are not covered by industrial relations processes.  This is far from true.  Accrued pension entitlements represent property rights.  Members of occupational pensions schemes already have available to them a range of recourses to vindicate their pension rights, for example, under relevant provisions of the Pensions Act 1990 or through the offices of the Pensions Authority and the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland, FSPO.  It is incorrect to assert that there are no avenues for redress for people who are in receipt of pensions.<\/p> <p> Pension scheme trustees must act in the best financial interest of all scheme members, whether active, deferred or retired, and I made this point earlier.  They must serve all beneficiaries of the scheme impartially.  Trustees must always be consulted if a collective agreement refers to a pension matter.  Furthermore, section 9 of the Bill proposes that retired workers' representative associations be permitted to refer trade disputes to the commission or the court, and that such representative associations be exempted from the requirement to hold a negotiating licence.  In this case, the proposition is that representative associations of retired workers would be exempted from meeting the standards applied to those organisations representing workers themselves.  This would be divisive and would potentially lead to claims for variation of the requirements governing negotiating licences.<\/p> <p> A large proportion of the Irish workforce has no occupational pension.  This is especially the case for younger people working in the private sector.  The Government is trying to remedy this situation through a new auto-enrolment system.  We must carefully consider whether a legislative proposal of this nature is the correct way of addressing the mischiefs and the concerns that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith stated are the objectives of her Bill.<\/p> <p> As I mentioned earlier, I have been informed that the proposed amendment to section 10 would not be of particular relevance to a large number of pension schemes.  The majority of defined contribution schemes are unlikely to have pensioner members in such schemes.  Members at retirement generally use their accumulated funds to buy an annuity or transfer to an approved retirement fund, ARF, and once this has been done the retiring member is no longer a member of the scheme.  We might not, therefore, be able to reach all those the Bill intends to reach.<\/p> <p> Pensioner benefits are already prioritised where a scheme restructuring occurs, with changes introduced in 2013 providing for 100% protection to pensions in payment of &euro;12,000 or less; 90% priority given to pensions between &euro;12,000 and &euro;60,000; and 80% protection to pensions over &euro;60,000.  The 2013 changes were designed to spread the risk of scheme under-funding to all scheme member cohorts and to ensure a more equitable sharing of scheme resources, where restructuring is required, while still providing for significant protections to pension benefits already in payment.<\/p> <p> Finally, the amendment proposed by section 10 may relate to a perceived lack of ability of pensioner members to engage with trustees and employers in the context of any changes to pension benefits payable from a scheme.  However, this perception is incorrect.  Where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, the employer and the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify scheme members, beneficiaries, and authorised trade unions.  Changes made to the Occupational Pension Schemes (Sections 50 and 50B) Regulations 2015 require trustees to also notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in these situations.  This affords the representative groups an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in advance of any proposed changes taking effect.<\/p> <p> These changes facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members, the Pensions Authority, and the trustees of a person scheme.  Specifically, before the trustees of a scheme make a section 50 application to the Pensions Authority, which could involve reductions to pension payments payable under a scheme, they must consult with the employer, the scheme member, pensioners and the authorised trade union representing members.  Trustees must undertake a comprehensive review of the scheme, with a view to the long-term stability and sustainability of the scheme.<\/p> <p> I am aware that Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith indicated her willingness to engage on constructive amendments.  As I said earlier, the Government is committed to examining this Bill in closer detail.  I am happy to have those conversations with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and others who are genuinely concerned and want to bring forward changes in this space.<\/p> <p> As part of this process, there will be a consultation process with the other relevant Departments, the unions, employer bodies and, of course, the people themselves are concerned.

There was a whole plethora of workers from semi-State, State and the private sector.  They gave their working lives, not only to their families and their companies, but to the State.  These workers were well-organised, in the great spirit of the trade unionism.  They were the people my parents grew up to admire and who stand shoulder to shoulder in the workplace.  That is the spirit of trade unionism, of sticking with each other and of solidarity.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial issue is that this is their money.  They should have a say in a pension fund that is kept aside for the future date when they retire.  Some of these workers do not get any State pension and are reliant on this occupational scheme for their income.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill provides that they will be consulted in regard to any change.  It seems democratic and simple, but that is obviously not the case.  We have a situation where former Ministers get very handsome pensions.  However, if there was a situation where their pensions went down or they were not consulted, they would be up in arms.  Some of the pensions Ministers have gotten are absurd.  It is quite sickening.  Some of them are on &euro;160,000 per year.  Some of the pension payments Deputies get are unbelievable, while working people, who have worked for decades, are on a very ordinary pension.  This Bill wants to change that.<\/p>  <p>  The spirit of the Bill is in the great tradition of decent pay and conditions.  It is for the future generation.  There are people who do not think of their futures in terms of pensions.  That is the key issue.  This generation wants to look out for the next generation in the case of pensions, the provision of pensions and democratic control around their money.  We have to think about this.  It is their money that they have worked so hard for but they do not have a say.  In the spirit of democracy, trade unionism and of workers sticking together, it is imperative this Bill goes through without the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000017#Q00500","speaker":"1565"},{"type":"speech","time":1625048820,"counter":69,"content":"<p>I want to respond to some of the things in the Minister of State&rsquo;s initial speech.  First, what jumped out at me more than anything else was the expression &ldquo;retired persons&rdquo;.  He referred at least ten times in his speech to &ldquo;retired persons&rdquo;.  Once or twice, when he was not reading it, he said &ldquo;retired workers&rdquo;.<\/p> <p>However, when the Minister of State said \"retired persons\", I was asking myself what they are retired from.  There is a claim there is some ill-defined category of \"retired workers\".  They have retired from work.  They worked all their lives, so they are retired workers.  Legal minds the Minister of State deals with may cause a row over that, but they are not retired persons, they are retired workers.<\/p> <p> This is why they want their voices heard as they face, and have faced for the past ten years, major attacks on their standard of living through cuts, the Government bailing out the banks and all sorts of measures which have been taken against their schemes and their voices cannot be heard.  The Minister of State maintains it is adequate for them to go to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman or the Pensions Authority but they have learned from hard experience that this is not sufficient.  It does not do the trick.  What they need is their voice at the table at the WRC.  The Minister of State then stated that to give them a right to the WRC may have unintended consequences but they have that right for six months, albeit only for six months, after a change is made.<\/p> <p> The Minister of State acknowledges the right for six months and then withdraws it.  He is refusing to say that right should be more than just the six months' limit put on it.  Retired public servants, civil aviation workers, ESB workers, CI&Eacute; workers , An Post and Bord na M&oacute;na workers, retired RT&Eacute; staff and semi-State staff, workers in this House, teachers, nurses, Eircom workers and the port and docks workers - you name it - are the people, as has been said repeatedly by Deputies in this House, who have built this country.<\/p> <p> I thank all of the Opposition Deputies for their support and contribution.  However, the Minister of State's speech has been littered with inaccuracies and evasions and is a complete slap in the face for retired workers, especially the amendment which states the Government will deal with this in 12 months, following consultation with the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform, with unions, employers, IBEC and industrial relations bodies, but nowhere does the Minister of State intend to consult with the very people this Bill is about.  The retired workers and their associations are deliberately excluded from the Minister of State's amendment and it is wholly insulting.<\/p> <p> I will talk briefly about the gilt-edged pensions about which Deputies Gino Kenny and Barry and others Deputies spoke.  The Minister of State and I can retire on a guaranteed pension that will be perceived by most of the population as being gilt-edged but former taoisigh and Ministers are on massive pensions.  For what?  What did they retire from?  If workers did not retire from work and are not retired workers, just retired persons in the Minister of State's legal empire, what did these other renowned people retire from for them to deserve so much money from the public coffers on an annual basis?<\/p> <p> There are technical arguments and unintended consequences, according to the Minister of State, but this Bill was produced after extensive consultation, which lasted two years, with experienced legal experts in the field of employment law from the OPLA.  I thank them for all their hard work.  Any issues the Minister of State, trade unions or IBEC have can be dealt with on Committee Stage and we are wide open to amendments to this Bill.  However, the core principle of this proposal is the right of retired workers' organisations to be consulted prior to changes in their pension schemes and to be able to take a case to the WRC without the current restrictions.<\/p> <p> Would it allow former workers to picket their workplace?  No.  We met the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and explained this to them.  It does not change the definition of a strike or allow former workers to put pickets on their workplace.  Some may say that is a pity.  Nevertheless, it does not do it and I want to reassure the Minister of State and anybody else that is the case.  This Bill will not address the systemic attack on pensions but will give retired workers, not retired persons, a voice and the right to representation and for their associations to represent them.  After a lifetime of work and building this society and the trade unions of which they were members, surely that is the least they deserve.<\/p> <p> While retired workers rights have been attacked in recent years, younger workers also find themselves paying more into schemes and getting less in return.  Here is an interesting statistic I got back in a parliamentary question.  Between 2011 and 2018, retired public sector workers saw the State take more than &euro;700 million directly from their pensions.  In the same period, their working colleagues, who remained in their jobs and had not yet retired, paid an extra &euro;2 billion in pension contributions for reduced benefits on retirement.<\/p> <p> There is a scam here.  There is a huge anomaly in terms of the right to representation and this flies in the face of European law to allow retired workers a voice.  The attempt by the Government to kick this can down the road is not only insulting, it is unrealistic.  People in their 70s and 80s have fought hard for the past ten years to get this Bill before the D&aacute;il and now the Government is saying they cannot have it and it is kicking it down the road and will talk to everybody but not them or their associations.  That has to be explained.  If Members from the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael vote to kick this down the road, they will feel the consequences.  This will not be because I say so but because these retired workers tell me so.<\/p> <p> It has been a pride and privilege to work with those people, their associations and with the senior citizens' parliament and Age Action Ireland, which is also backing this proposal.  That is a huge cohort of citizens in this country who do use their votes, unlike younger people who tend to be in the lesser-voting category.  The Government should be mindful of that.  That is not to threaten the Government but to try to put leverage on it to say please give retired workers the chance to have this Bill go to Committee Stage, where it can be scrutinised and amended.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000017#Q00600","speaker":"1486","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625049420,"counter":71,"content":"<p>Amendment put.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1625049420,"counter":72,"content":"<p>In accordance with Standing Order 80(2), the division is postponed to the weekly division time this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000018#R00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Ceisteanna \u00f3 Cheannair\u00ed - Leaders' Questions","time":1625049420,"counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000018#R00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1625049420,"counter":74,"content":"<p>We have seen some moments of chaos during the lifetime of the Government but yesterday was a new peak.  The Taoiseach says the advice given to him by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, came as a bolt out of the blue.  That advice was not to reopen indoor hospitality and that when hospitality would be reopened, to make it available to vaccinated persons only.  The Taoiseach says he was caught unawares by that.<\/p>  <p>  That is an extraordinary situation given the Taoiseach heads the Government and it is incumbent on him to put in place plans and contingency measures in light of the very real danger posed by the Delta variant.  However, the Taoiseach did not do that.  Once again, he marched the hospitality sector to the top of the hill, only to march it back down again and he now pursues a plan which gives zero consideration to young people.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the situation of a 19-year-old, a 25-year-old or a 30-year-old in Ireland this morning.  Many of them have held and hold the line on the front line, while working in retail and in schools and hospitals.  Others have lost jobs.  Many have not seen a day's work in a year and a half.  Others had their time at college but they were not on campus; they were in their bedrooms.  All have had their opportunities to travel severely curtailed, taken from them at that time of their lives when it is natural to wish to explore the world.  T&oacute;gadh gach rud &oacute; dhaoine &oacute;ga, f&aacute;gadh ar leataobh iad le linn na paind&eacute;ime seo agus n&iacute;l s&eacute; seo maith go leor.<\/p> <p>On top of all the pandemic disruption, consider their prospects for an affordable or a secure home.  They can forget about that on the Taoiseach's watch.  If they are relying on the PUP because their job disappeared, it is going to be slashed.  If they find themselves on jobseeker's allowance, the message to young people is they are less deserving than people who are older than them.  We now find ourselves in the summer months, after an extraordinary year and in a time when our young people deserve a break.  It is perfectly legitimate for young people to want to socialise together and meet up with their friends.  They were told they would have an outdoor summer and to prepare for that, and they did.  They socialise outdoors and most behave themselves perfectly well.  A small element, not all of whom are young people by the way, misbehaves yet all young people are then treated as a nuisance, a threat and a problem.  They are told essentially to get off the streets and wait for the pubs to reopen.<\/p> <p> Yesterday, the Government told young people they can work in pubs and restaurants and serve their elders but they should forget about having a drink after work in the same establishment or a meal in the establishment next door.  The Taoiseach cannot do that.  The time has come to stop paying lip service to young people and to listen to them and meet their needs.  I am asking the Taoiseach to give young people a chance to benefit from the reopening of our society and from the very hard work they have invested in protecting everyone else in society.  In other words, I am asking the Taoiseach to treat young people fairly.<\/p> <p> So far, the Government has disregarded the obvious solutions in this regard.  We have talked about antigen testing for what seems like forever, yet the Government stubbornly refuses to pursue widespread antigen testing.  People now ask why Ireland is the last place in Europe where people cannot eat or drink indoors.  The answer is that elsewhere antigen testing is being used.  We need to get our young people vaccinated.  We need to ensure people in the 60 to 69 age group get their second vaccine and that happens quickly.  We still have no clarity as to when the changes to the vaccine programme, which are woefully late, will take effect.  The Government is only now engaging with the hospitality industry.  It is truly a mess.  This must be sorted and the Government must now deliver a plan of action that is fair to the hospitality industry but also to the younger generation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000018#R00500","speaker":"1466","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625050020,"counter":76,"content":"<p>I agree with the Deputy's fundamental assertions.  I regret the fact that since this Government was formed, she has been so divisive in her approach to Covid-19.  She has always sought to use it as an avenue to exploit for political gain.  My more important point is this.  Everyone in the House should take on board that the Delta variant is a serious and challenging issue, and will be across Europe.  The advice from NPHET is to that effect.  Whether we like it or not, the Delta variant is far more transmissible and creates risks.  That is the essence of the advice that was presented to us by NPHET and of the modelling that was also presented to us, which was stark with respect to case numbers, hospitalisations, ICU occupancy and deaths for July, August and September.  I ask that Deputy McDonald take that on board and accept it.<\/p>  <p>  Is is Deputy McDonald's view that we should have pressed ahead with the opening of hospitality on 5 July given the warnings and projections we got about the impact of the Delta variant?  I would like her to answer that question openly and honestly because this is a key point.  The Government's decision yesterday was not to proceed.  That is the fundamental decision we took.  We decided to delay proceeding on 5 July and engage with the hospitality industry.  Covid has been devastating for the hospitality industry.  I know that.  It has been devastating for travel and tourism since the very beginning, not just here but around the world.  The impact of Covid has been devastating for many societies.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke yesterday with Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland, and she used a very telling phrase.  She said Delta will rip through an unvaccinated population.  Scotland has all its eggs in the vaccination basket, with 60% of the population fully vaccinated.  There are some hopeful signs that there may be a breaking of the link between case numbers and hospitalisations but that is not certain yet and will take more monitoring.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy used the word \"chaos\" and the word \"mess\" gets mentioned.  If one looks back over the last number of months, we have reopened society steadily, successfully and effectively, in terms of schools, childcare, sport for young people, construction, outdoor hospitality, personal services and retail.  That is not chaotic.  It has not been a mess.  It has been steady, progressive and wise, and it has produced results.  The decision yesterday is to protect all that.  That is my only motivation and the only motivation of the Government is to protect that and protect people, not divide people and society.  We want to protect society.<\/p>  <p>  I understand how difficult Covid has been for young people.  I know that.  It has affected their college life and work.  That is why the pandemic unemployment payment was brought in for students in the first instance.  The threshold that has been set in respect of vaccination for hospitality is a very high one that will prove very challenging.  We want to engage with industry because we understand how difficult it has been for the sector and for young people.  The Government does not take decisions on the immunisation strategy.  The NIAC decision will help us accelerate vaccination and that is a good thing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000019#S00200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1625050020,"counter":77,"content":"<p>The aggressive transmissibility of the Delta variant and the danger it poses were not new to the Taoiseach yesterday.

As I said, the Government is marching this sector up the hill only to march it back down, again?  It is divisive to single out young people who do not have the opportunity to avail of vaccination and tell them they can work in the hospitality sector but they cannot avail of it.  That is wrong and divisive.<\/p>  <p>  The Taoiseach asked me what should happen.  The sector should be reopened, and safely.  A clear plan for that should be set out.  We should have a Government that is not announcing days beforehand that this will not, in fact, happen.  When will young people be vaccinated?  What is the timetable for that?  What of antigen and PCR testing?  How will the Government deploy these measures to ensure that when the sector is reopened everybody, including the young, who run these services to an enormous extent, can also avail of them?

I would very much appreciate him answering some of my questions.  I am posing these questions not just for me or other Members in the House but for the many thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on this extremely important sector, many of whom have not been able to open their doors or return to work in 16 months.<\/p>  <p>  On the Monday before last, 21 June, the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, announced that the Delta variant accounted for 20% of Covid-19 cases reported in the previous week.  He stated that the figures demonstrated \"a concerning increase in transmission of the Delta variant\".  Did he raise these concerns about the proposed reopening of hospitality with anyone in the Government at that point or at any point this week?  The Government seemed to be briefing that there was likely to be a postponement of that reopening.  What action has been taken in that regard and when did the CMO alert the Government to this matter?<\/p>  <p>  In the CMO's letter to the Minister for Health published yesterday, he referred to the revised national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, advice that those under 40 should have the option to receive either an AstraZeneca or Janssen vaccine but it is unclear if that advice was factored into the modelling.  Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the modelling published by NPHET incorporates the revised vaccination programme?<\/p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste discussed this matter on the radio earlier.  I made the point that the Government has highlighted the minority of EU countries that operate a Covid-19 pass for indoor services.  Does the Taoiseach accept that these countries planned for this system in advance and that he majority facilitate the use of PCR and antigen testing in order that they do not discriminate against unvaccinated people, who are predominantly younger people?  In that regard, how can the Government stand over the fact that unvaccinated younger people will be working in bars and restaurants where they will be unable to sit down for a meal or a drink?

We got advice from which we formulated the original opening in July and at that stage we were told we were in a low- to medium-risk scenario.  The Delta variant had not quite penetrated here at that point but everybody knew in the days leading up to last weekend that there were issues arising in the context of reopening.  The clarion calls all weekend were that we should bring forward the meetings in order to get an early decision and not to have the hospitality industry waiting until Thursday or Friday for that decision by the Government.  We brought forward those meetings.  The results of modelling we received from NPHET and the group led by Professor Philip Nolan on Monday certainly makes the decision to pause the reopening of the hospitality industry the correct one.  I ask the Deputy if she agrees that on the basis of that modelling alone, a decision had to be taken to pause and delay the reopening the hospitality sector.<\/p>  <p>  The further advice given in respect of vaccination is going to give rise to challenges.  As the Deputy knows, the Government's original position in late May was that vaccinations would be a factor in permitting access to domestic access to facilities and services.  We now have a significant challenge with respect to indoor hospitality.  What NPHET is saying, very clearly, is that indoor activity poses the greatest risk, particularly indoor hospitality.  We know that from previous waves of the pandemic.  The challenge now as we engage with the hospitality sector is to see if we can work our way through this in order to facilitate the reopening of hospitality.  The threshold being set by NPHET is very high and it will be very challenging in itself when it comes to non-reproducible and enforceable elements.  We are committed to examine this matter further and to engage with the industry on it.<\/p>  <p>  The NPHET letter and the modelling have been published.  The significant shock was in respect of the modelling, with NPHET indicating the very high numbers that could arise as a result of the spread of the variant.  On the plus side, it is clear that the faster we can get people vaccinated, the more effective that weapon will be against the Delta variant and the effects of the pandemic.

There are many reasons that this might happen.<\/p> <p>From my experience at the doors the issue is very much to do with an entire generation of young people, which we talked about earlier, and their parents, who are absolutely furious about the failure of successive Governments to provide for that entire generation of young people the prospect of actually being able to have an affordable roof over their heads in the coming years.  That problem of the housing crisis caused by the successive failures of Fianna F&aacute;il- and Fine Gael-led Governments is not just for a whole generation of young working people.  It also affects older people who might find themselves separated, evicted by landlords because of loopholes in residential tenancies legislation and so on.<\/p> <p> The Government and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, have said they are going to try to do something about it.  I have very serious doubts about that and about the Government's actual commitment to provide public and genuinely affordable housing for the people who need it.  Tonight the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 will be completing its journey through the D&aacute;il.  In our view, the Government is going to open up the entire public landbank to private financiers, private investment funds and so on, when that land should be used exclusively for the delivery of public and genuinely affordable housing.  By \"genuinely affordable\" we do not mean &euro;450,000 in parts of Dublin or &euro;400,000, which is completely unaffordable for the vast majority or working people.  We mean affordable based on the people's income, where they should not have to pay 50%, 60% or 70% of income on mortgage repayments or on rents.  They should have to pay no more than 25%.<\/p> <p> When we debated these issues on Committee Stage of the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 recently, on foot of our objections about this the Minister said he would bring in amendments that would mean, at least in the major urban centres, there would be a change of heart by the Government and that public land would be used to provide 100% public and genuinely affordable housing.  The Minister has not brought forward those amendments.  The Affordable Housing Bill is still not clear that affordable housing will actually be affordable for ordinary working people.

It is absolutely essential that we do everything we possibly can to build houses, get supply up, and to provide social and affordable housing: houses that people can afford to buy.  The Minister has brought in a range of measures, and is bringing in measures both legislatively and through initiatives, to help people and young people in particular to be able to afford to buy a house.  The help-to-buy scheme was expanded and 22,000 people availed of that.  The scheme was a benefit to them, even though many in the House opposed it.  Likewise, some &euro;700 million is allocated in the budget to affordability measures such as cost rental homes, shared equity schemes, the Rebuilding Ireland home loans and so on.  Extra funding has been allocated to the serviced sites fund, which will provide housing through the local authorities that will be affordable for people.  Those measures will have an impact.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has brought forward amendments in the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  The Deputy used the phrase \"genuinely affordable\", so clearly he is arguing in terms of definitions of what is and is not affordable.  The Minister and the Government have approved an amendment to provide for 80% affordable housing in urban areas with populations greater than 150,000.  This will provide for 100% affordable and social housing in those areas, given the proposed revised Part V arrangements to be brought in through the Affordable Housing Bill 2021.<\/p>  <p>  It is very important that we get the Land Development Agency Bill through the House before the summer so we can get on with the job of getting houses built and getting houses built on public land that are affordable and social homes, so people can avail of them.  I urge everybody, in every political party and on every local authority, to do everything they personally can to get projects through and to reduce delays and opposition to projects that are shovel ready.  We need them built.  If we do not get supply up then younger people will be denied access to the kinds of affordable housing, the type which the Deputy wants people to have genuine access to, and which I do too.  I accept this.  We cannot, however, keep on navel gazing forever on these issues.

To pay for a house that costs &euro;400,000, &euro;450,000 or &euro;500,000 a person would need an income in excess of &euro;90,000 or &euro;100,000.

The Taoiseach stated earlier that Nicola Sturgeon said it would cut through the country.  Nursing homes have had a very serious time in trying to deal with Covid.

Since 1991, I have been a great advocate for it and it has played a huge role in the development and enhancement of rural areas, particularly through rural economies and entrepreneurship.  With co-financing from the European Union, LEADER has created thousands of projects throughout Ireland, along with job creation, community development and environmental projects.  It is funded under Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy and the European agricultural fund for rural development.  On 28 June, European Union agriculture ministers accepted the provisional agreement reached between the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament on the CAP post-2020 legislative proposals.  These will cover the period 2023 to 2027.  A transitional arrangement agreed in 2020 will continue to apply for 2021 and 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, in line with the programme for Government, announced details of allocations of approximately &euro;70 million transitional LEADER programme funding for the period covering 2021 and 2022.  This came into effect from April of this year.  Of the &euro;70 million announced, &euro;20 million is funded by the European Union recovery instrument funding, which is Next Generation EU funding.  Of this &euro;70 million, &euro;65 million will be made available to local action groups for the delivery of the transitional LEADER programme and 75% of the funding is being allocated to new project activity, with the remaining 25% for administration and other costs.  A further &euro;3 million of the funding is being allocated to support co-operation projects and innovation between local action groups.  The remaining &euro;2 million is being provided to support strategy development for the next LEADER programme.<\/p>  <p>  Project activity has already commenced and 68 core projects to a value of &euro;2.8 million have been approved so far.  A further 22 co-operation projects, with a value of in excess of &euro;1.8 million, have also been approved.  There will be an increase in the maximum rate of aid each local action group may award to private enterprises, community projects with a commercial basis and social enterprises from 50% to 75% for the duration of the transitional programme.  Increasing the rate of aid, which was effective from 1 April 2021, will help stimulate rural economies and sustain jobs in rural areas, particularly in a post-Covid recovery scenario.<\/p>  <p>  The final call for applications under the &euro;15 million LEADER food initiative has been announced.

The AstraZeneca vaccine is being used to make sure that everybody between 60 and 69 years and everybody who has had a first doze of AstraZeneca gets a second dose by 19 July.  That plan is already in place.  The next phase is to continue down through the age cohorts.  Over 340,000 vaccines were administered last week.  There will be a similar amount this week.  As soon as we are getting them in, we are trying to get them out as quickly again.  That is working.  I have no doubt about the competency of the HSE and the task force to move on the remaining elements of this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000024#X01200","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1625053020,"counter":173,"content":"<p>I wish to raise the important issue of cancer screening in light of the recent remarks by the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, that chemotherapy and radiotherapy services were down by 30% and 20%, respectively, when those services should be increasing 5% per annum because of our age demographics and rising population.

There are more than 300,000 registered rental tenancies throughout the State.  Three-quarters of a million people live in the private rental sector.  Over recent years, rents have continued to spiral out of control.  In the dying days of 2016, the then Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Coveney, introduced the rent pressure zone legislation.  Fine Gael promised that rents would be constrained in high demand areas by 4% a year.  We said clearly at that stage that a 4% rent increase annually, 12% over three years, was unacceptable but we also said that those measures would not work.  Four years on, unfortunately, we have been proven correct.  During that period, rents have increased in parts of the country by 20%, and by more than 30% in other parts.  For example, according to the latest figures from the Residential Tenancies Board, average rents in Dublin city today are &euro;1,700 a month.  Average rents in Cork city and county are more than &euro;1,000 a month.  Rents in Limerick and Kilkenny, and many other places, are more than &euro;1,000 a month.<\/p><p>Asking rents, which are recorded by <i>daft.ie<\/i>quarterly rent reports, are even higher.  In fact, in many parts of Dublin city and county, asking rents are between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,500 a month for very standard two or three-bedroom accommodation.  While the Minister is talking about introducing measures at the end of this year to replace the rent pressure zone legislation, the concern many of us have is that it will still allow some level of rental increases which renters cannot afford.<\/p><p>What are the consequences of these uncontrolled rents?  The first is that it places significant financial strain on working people, including many who are young and those who are in their fifties and early sixties approaching retirement age who are fearful of what the future will hold.  It also means that money these renters should have in their pockets to spend in their local economies is not being spent in this way and as a result in many parts of the country jobs are negatively affected.<\/p> <p>For those renters who are trying to save a deposit to buy their own home, such sky high rents make that task almost impossible.  In fact, every Member of the House will have been contacted by constituents who have been forced either to share accommodation with other adult couples well into their 30s or to return home to their parents' houses simply to be able to save.  That has all sorts of consequences in terms of their independence and forestalling significant decisions in life such as having children.<\/p> <p> What must we do?  As a matter of urgency, we must ban rent increases for a period of time.  The Bill I am introducing does exactly that.  It would ban rent increases on existing and new tenancies for three years.  That would give renters some breathing space, while other measures that Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued for could be introduced.  The idea that it is acceptable to have any further rent increases this year, next year or in the following year beggars belief.  Any politician who says he or she wants to stand by renters should support our legislation.  Of course, we must go much further than that.  We have to try to find a way of reducing rents.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued that the most effective way of doing that is through the introduction of a refundable tax credit worth one month's rent for an emergency period of three years.  We also must introduce tenancies of indefinite duration and a national car test, NCT, style certification system run by local authorities to ensure minimum standards.  Ultimately, the long-term stability of the rental sector will be decided by the level of investment the Government makes in secure, affordable, cost-rental accommodation.  This year, the Government is only spending &euro;35 million on that and will deliver a few hundred units.  We need, at a minimum, 4,000 cost-rental units delivered by the local authorities and others every year until this crisis is resolved.<\/p> <p> This Bill is very simple.  It says it is time to stand up for renters and struggling working families.  It is time to ban rent increases for three years.  We will move Second Stage of this Bill in Private Members' time as a matter of urgency to give Deputies an opportunity to make clear whether they stand with renters or not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000025#Y02300","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625054220,"counter":200,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000026#Z00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625054220,"counter":201,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000026#Z00300","speaker":"1475"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625054220,"counter":202,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1625054220,"counter":203,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000026#Z00500","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625054220,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000026#Z00600","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625054220,"counter":205,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Presentation of Estimates: Motion","time":1625054220,"counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000026#Z00800"},{"type":"speech","time":1625054220,"counter":207,"content":"<p>I move:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThat, notwithstanding Standing Order 215 of the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann relative to Public Business or the Resolution of the D&aacute;il of 16th December, 2020, the following Further Revised Estimate for Public Services for the year ending 31st December, 2021, be presented to the D&aacute;il and circulated to members on 30th June, 2021, being a date later than that prescribed for the presentation of Estimates and be referred to the relevant Select or Standing Committee, as the case may be, pursuant to Standing Orders 95(1)(<i>a<\/i>), 123(5) and 215(3):  \tVote 33 &mdash;

What is the status of the talks with the UK?  That would be good information for the House.  We are due to go live on 19 July.  Can the Taoiseach confirm if this is still the case?  Yesterday, NPHET recommended that unvaccinated people should not travel, even with a clear test.  Obviously, we are not taking action on that because it would be contrary to European law.  I find it totally bizarre that NPHET does not work within the parameter of the law of the land given that we are part of Europe.  There is nothing wrong with saying that.  I am very supportive of public health, but surely it must be done within the guidance of the law.  There are many comparisons with what other EU countries are doing, particularly as regards indoor dining.<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  Another matter on which we diverge from other countries is antigen testing.  I have raised this previously.  I do not understand why we are not doing antigen testing.  I did it myself for months.  Antigen tests have a major role to play, and they have a major role in getting members of the Government out of the situation in which they find themselves at present.  Both Denmark and Britain send out thousands of these tests every day and week.  That is hundreds of thousands or millions of tests.  They certainly have a role.  I believe the Taoiseach believes they have a role, and the T&aacute;naiste has said so as well.  They must have a role now.  Certainly, that would make more sense as part of a mixture of measures, along with vaccinations, to be able to reopen society and particularly to deal with the indoor dining conundrum.  Denmark, a country with a similar population to ours, has a daily testing capacity of 500,000 antigen tests and 200,000 PCR tests.  That is how it reopened.  It is similar in size to this country.<\/font><\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I do not believe we can continue with a plan that discriminates against young people.  I vehemently oppose that.  As regards the options for the future, there are the Janssen vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine, of which there will be a lesser amount, and antigen testing as part of it.  I will strongly insist that this is the route we must take rather than anything else, which is more complicated.

This was launched on 9 May last.  We must have real engagement with citizens here on this matter.  In particular, we have to engage with citizens living in Northern Ireland, other EU citizens living in Ireland and especially with young people.  I have a question for the Taoiseach about the issue of treaty change.  In practical terms, treaty change means giving more power to the EU institutions, including the European Parliament, and diminishing unanimity voting.  Arising from the pandemic, there has been talk of giving new competencies to the EU, for example, in the area of public health.  According to a report by RT&Eacute; News on 22 April last, an internal Government memorandum indicated that the Irish Government will resist any move to change EU treaties in the context of the conference and it has joined 11 other similar countries to oppose treaty change.  Is that the position?  As we know, treaty change involves a referendum in Ireland.  Ireland previously initially rejected both the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  Can the Taoiseach clarify the position of the Government on this issue?<\/p><p><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">  I also wish to raise briefly rule of law concerns.  Mr. Victor Orb&aacute;n in Hungary has introduced a discriminatory law against the LGBT community.  The Dutch Prime Minister has gone as far as saying that Hungary should leave the European Union.

Before this morning, I understood that there was clarity on this matter.<\/p> <p> I made several representations to the Department of Health on behalf of people who live in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan but who work in the North.

They have every entitlement and right, as I am sure the Taoiseach will agree, to avail of the EU's digital Covid-19 certificate, as we would expect would be the case for all the people in the North who have been vaccinated.  A little confusion has arisen in this regard, however, because of a statement issued by the Government press office to RT&Eacute; which cast some doubt on the position.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, indicated on RT&Eacute; this morning that there will be no issue.

Approximately 16 million people, half the population, are suffering from hunger, 3 million have been displaced and an estimated 220,000 have lost their lives, either directly or indirectly as a result of the war.  The Saudi Arabian regime is deeply implicated in the horrific military campaign which has caused this humanitarian disaster, and, of course, the United States has also provided military and logistical assistance to the Saudi Arabian regime.<\/p>  <p>  That regime in Saudi Arabia is involved in crushing any dissent.  It is not possible to oppose the war, although many Saudis Arabians do.  I was at a protest with Saudi Arabians and Yemenis outside the Saudi Arabian Embassy in the past two weeks.

They are facing extra exploitation due to their immigration status.

From a European Union perspective, that is a significant achievement, given that it was only mooted in December last year.  It was initially an idea proposed by the Greek Prime Minister and the Commission then took it on board.  Ireland will operate the new digital certificate from 19 July for travel originating within the European Union and the EEA.  It will be subject to the prevailing public health situation, but we intend to go ahead as we decided this week.  We broadly align ourselves with the approach of the European Union regarding non-essential travel into the Union from third countries, including from the United Kingdom and United States.  I think this will facilitate safe international travel in accordance with clear safety protocols and public health advice.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to the matter of testing, the European Commission has provided supports regarding antigen testing.  Different countries have different models.  Deputy Kelly mentioned Denmark, which from the outset has been one of the countries with the highest capacity for testing.  We are also best in class, with 120,000 tests conducted per week.  We are now flexible in the context of our walk-in centres and self-referrals.  All of those were open in the last week and that indicates that people themselves are cautious and taking precautions on their own initiative.  I thought that was interesting and I got interesting figures in that respect this morning from the CEO of the HSE.<\/p>  <p>  Moving on to the vaccination advice from the national immunisation advisory council, NIAC, we have approximately 100,000 doses of the Janssen vaccine in stock and we have some more additional vaccines as well.  However, we want more visibility towards the end of July and in August.  Regarding AstraZeneca, the current trend is that 300,000 doses came in yesterday, but those will be used for the those in the 60-to-69 age group and people who need a second dose.  I understand that 25,000 doses are due in from AstraZeneca on 5 July.  That is what we have visibility of.  In addition, there will be more than 37,000 on 12 July.  Following that, there will be approximately 500,000 doses, but we do not have visibility yet from AstraZeneca on the actual delivery schedule for the last two weeks of July.  We must have visibility in that regard before we can make commitments concerning that delivery.  If that was to transpire, however, it would have a significant impact on the vaccination programme.  There would be a similar situation in the context of greater availability of Janssen vaccines.  Equally, the model which has been developed with pharmacies has worked well with the Janssen vaccine.  Therefore, it lends itself to rapid deployment in respect of the arrival of additional Janssen vaccines in the context of the advice we have received.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Haughey raised a pertinent point regarding treaty change and engaging with young people in respect of the Conference for Europe.  I agree wholeheartedly with that and we need a debate in Ireland on our participation in Europe.  We must energise younger generations regarding the European ideal, how it is the greatest peace project since the Second World War and its major achievements.  In the context of international relations, Europe is the most progressive and advanced bloc in the world in respect of the humanitarian assistance it provides to many people.  That was most recently manifested in the form of the vaccination programme, with more than 350 million vaccines exported from Europe across the world.  We have not brought in protectionism or sought to stop such exports.<\/p>  <p>  On the point concerning competencies, the memo which was referred to is not Government policy.  Our policy is to be open to treaty change.  I believe we must be open to it.  Not all treaty change means a constitutional referendum either, by the way.  In the area of public health, particularly, and given our experience during the pandemic, I am an advocate for greater competencies in that regard at European Union level, in respect of epidemiology, for example.

It is my firm belief that no conversation should ever take place between any Taoiseach and British Prime Minister where this issue is not raised until such time as the British Government releases its files so that we can provide the truth and justice that the families of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings deserve.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000028#BB01600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1625055420,"counter":252,"content":"<p>Deputy Haughey asked about the state of Anglo-Irish relations and the review of the strategic relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom, post Brexit.<\/p> <p>Progress is under way in that regard.  During our most recent meeting, the British Prime Minister and I agreed to increase the momentum of the engagement between our officials in respect of the bilateral relationship between Britain and Ireland post-pandemic.  We are hoping to bring that to a conclusion in the coming weeks.  It is an important issue because, as the Deputy said, since Britain left the European Union, the opportunities and forums that were there to nurture the relationship between the UK and Ireland in an EU context are no longer available.  Brexit has clearly created challenges in respect of the relationship.<\/p> <p> In the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and trade and co-operation agreement, we have sought that the UK would work with the European Union through the mechanisms that are provided for in the withdrawal agreement to resolve any issues emerging on the Northern side in respect of the protocol.  That work has been under way but it has been of a stop-start nature.  It is important that political will would attach to it.  I have met all the principal leaders of the Commission and they are committed to resolving the issues.  There is goodwill there.  The UK Government needs to engage as well, and I have made this point to the British Prime Minister.<\/p> <p> Narrow Water bridge is a significant development and reflects the importance of the shared island fund, which, for the first time in 30 years, gives us ring-fenced capacity to put flesh on the bones of important projects North and South.  I met Nichola Mallon MLA, the Minister of Infrastructure of the Northern Ireland Executive earlier this week to discuss the announcement because she has campaigned for a long time on the Narrow Water bridge project.  We have allocated an initial &euro;3 million to bring the project to tender stage and we intend to allocate further funding to enable it to happen.  Louth County Council will be the lead agency in delivering this and on the Northern side greater active transport initiatives will be put in place in parallel with the project.  For both communities North and South, this is a clear manifestation of the capacities we have secured through the shared island fund to make things happen on a North-South basis.<\/p> <p> We also need progress on the legacy issues by all parties involved and we must do it on a collective basis.  Deputy Richmond made a number of significant points about making the protocol work and that is what we are endeavouring to do in respect of North-South and east-west engagement.  The British Irish Council provides a forum for off the record engagements and for the capacity for participants to sound each other out in informal settings.  That is valuable and it is important, as Deputy Richmond said, that we would make sure that these meetings will be scheduled in the diary, although Covid has had an impact on that in the recent past.  I know it has been a historic issue that the British Prime Minister does not attend but it would be great if he could attend.  It was a constructive meeting with all the heads of administration and we shared a lot of good practice around Covid.  I also had an opportunity to speak to all the parties from the North on the protocol and the Executive and I found it useful.  Again this illustrates that meeting in person is far more effective than meeting online in terms of those informal engagements.<\/p> <p> I will talk with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, about his discussions with the Saudi Government.  With Ireland as a member of the UN Security Council, the Minister has been extremely busy in endeavouring to deal with a range of international issues, not least the Yemen war, which, as the Deputy said, has had an appalling impact on so many innocent people.  I met the UN Secretary General last week and he has been warm in his appreciation of Ireland's role on the UN Security Council on many of these issues, not least the Middle East.  We will continue to do that on an international level and the Minister will represent the country in that respect.<\/p> <p> On healthcare, the big issue the UK is learning is that since it has restricted European citizens in particular from going into the UK, it has had an impact on its workforce and its capacity to recruit people.  We need be conscious of that lesson.<\/p> <p> Deputy Paul Murphy said that I rejected advice on the challenges raised by the Delta variant.  I never did so.  Ireland is the only country in the European Union that has introduced mandatory hotel quarantine.  It is clear that more than 50% of cases in Northern Ireland are of the Delta variant and that more than 95% of those in the Britain involve the Delta variant.  All of Europe, such as Poland and Portugal, have high rates of the Delta variant.  Portugal is introducing restrictions again on hospitality and it has had to reverse because of the Delta variant.  The CMO is of the view that we will face a European-wide Delta variant wave.  We put India on the list for mandatory hotel quarantine but our levels of transport are low.  We have a seamless border on the island and it is not possible to seal it.  That is a fact and we have learned that.<\/p> <p> On Deputy Carthy's point, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made it clear that there will not be an issue for Irish citizens on the island, North or South, in accessing the Covid digital certificate.  I never lose an opportunity to raise the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and I did so again at the most recent meeting I had with the British Prime Minister when we discussed legacy issues.  Successive Irish Governments have consistently sought all of the information in British hands on that terrible atrocity that was committed in 1974.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000028#BB01700","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Cabinet Committees","time":1625056020,"counter":254,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00200"},{"type":"question","time":1625056020,"counter":255,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[33088\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee that deals with agriculture will next meet.","asker":"1466","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1625056020,"counter":256,"qnumday":16,"qnumall":"[34646\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee that deals with agriculture will next meet.","asker":"1610","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1625056020,"counter":257,"qnumday":17,"qnumall":"[34654\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"when the Cabinet committee that deals with agriculture is next due to meet.","asker":"1611","askee":"1458"},{"type":"question","time":1625056020,"counter":258,"qnumday":18,"qnumall":"[34655\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00600","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if there is a Cabinet committee or sub-committee that deals with agriculture.","asker":"1556","askee":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1625056020,"counter":259,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 to 18, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  Issues relevant to agriculture are discussed, as required, at a number of Cabinet committees, including the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and investment, which last met on 27 May, and the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change, which last met on 31 May 2021 and is scheduled to meet again on 1 July 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The agriculture sector is the largest indigenous industry in the country and it has a key role to play in the economic and social vibrancy of our towns, villages and rural communities, as well as in achieving our decarbonisation targets for 2030 and 2050.  It plays a critical role in Irish society and the economy and Government works with all stakeholders on key agricultural issues.  These include: development of the agrifood strategy - this is a commitment in the programme for Government and it will set out a vision for the Irish agrifood sector up to 2030; Ireland's priorities in the renegotiation of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP; and supporting the fisheries and agricultural sectors to deal with the effects of Brexit.  As with all policy areas, agricultural issues are regularly discussed at full Government meetings and that is where all formal decisions are made.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to meetings of the Cabinet and its committees, I regularly meet Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to discuss particular issues.  In the context of the extension and expansion of social dialogue, I recently had a useful meeting, along with the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and various officials, with a range of farming bodies representing the agricultural pillar.  We discussed the full range of issues pertaining to Irish agriculture and the range of challenges it faces, from the CAP right across to the climate agenda, energy efficiency measures and a range of other issues that the farming organisations raised with us.  The larger Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, were represented, as were other smaller organisations that represent rural farmers and farmers in specialised areas.  Macra na Feirme, which has particular perspectives on young farmers and the need for progressive policies to facilitate young farmers to thrive in the sector, was also involved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1458"},{"type":"speech","time":1625056020,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I wonder if the Taoiseach would give his opinion on whether he believes there is an inherent unfairness in the way that CAP funds are distributed in Ireland.<\/p> <p>Some beef barons, sheikhs and others can draw down hundreds of thousands of euro in CAP funds while most family farmers are expected to meet the same criteria on fractions of that funding.  I ask that because it would be helpful for us to get the Fianna F&aacute;il position on the matter.  In the previous CAP negotiations, the then Fianna F&aacute;il agriculture spokesperson organised meetings the length and breadth of the country, particularly on the western coast, in opposition to the approach taken by the then Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine at EU level to fight against any measures of redistribution, instead arguing for so-called flexibilities at a national level.  During this CAP negotiation process, the current Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has adopted exactly the same position.  The word &quot;flexibility&quot; is used as a guise for defending the <i>status quo<\/i>.  Flexibility has been referenced by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, on several occasions to defend what he would describe as national sovereignty.  Does the Taoiseach agree that in the interests of national sovereignty of the democratic decision-making process, the Minister should bring his CAP strategic plan, the plan in which he will use the flexibility for which he has fought so hard, before the D&aacute;il for debate, amendment, discussion and, ultimately, approval?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000029#CC00800","speaker":"1451","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625056620,"counter":262,"content":"<p>I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that the farming and agrifood sector is at the heart of all Government deliberations at Cabinet and subcommitee levels.  That is important because 175,000 people are employed in the sector and it is responsible for 10% of Irish exports.  It has faced particular challenges over the past number of years, including CAP reform.  In 2014, the European Parliament, European Council and European Commission effectively and unfortunately reduced the budget for CAP.  That was a bad decision.  At the same time, one third of the EU budget until 2027 will go to CAP, a total of &euro;387 billion.<\/p>  <p>  The farming community wants a clear message that the national co-financing commitments that were made will be honoured over the next number of years and that the &euro;1.5 billion from the carbon tax fund will be allocated to the farming sector.  There is often a lazy and ill-informed narrative with regard to farming and climate change.  Farmers have adapted and modernised their systems.  Our food production systems are sustainable and in the climate debate, while we all know there must be improvements from every sector in that regard, we must ensure that sustainable food production systems in Europe are not displaced by food being imported from areas in South America and elsewhere where forests are being felled to make land arable. <\/p>  <p>  The Common Agricultural Policy was established to ensure a secure supply of safe food for the citizens of Europe.  It provides income support to farmers but it also ensures that there is continuity of sustainable production of food, which is very important, and plays a key role in the environment and in ensuring we have people living in rural Ireland.  Our commitment must be absolute to ensuring that additional financial support is provided through national co-financing, alongside CAP-supported schemes.  We all know that if we are to have a vibrant rural Ireland, our farming and agrifood sectors must be the lead economic drivers in that regard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000030#DD00200","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speech","time":1625056620,"counter":263,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy Carthy's points, Fianna F&aacute;il's role in the Common Agricultural Policy and its evolution, going back to the days of Commissioner Ray MacSharry, has been exemplary in terms of fairness, farm families and ensuring the sustainability of the Common Agricultural Policy within the European Union framework throughout this decade.  Deputy Brendan Smith, when he was Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, did an enormous amount of work, particularly in terms of sustainable food production.  It has been an honourable tradition which the current Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is continuing in respect of the current negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy.  There has always been a need for flexibilities on the operation of CAP but they have been reducing over the years.  On another day, Deputy Carthy would come in here and look for greater subsidiarity in respect of European Union measures, and greater flexibilities.<\/p>  <p>  The current situation is that the discussions have moved fairly well and are coming to a conclusion.  The results will not be universally accepted all round because people will prefer different elements of the agreement.  We are getting closer.  Member states will have the option to cap the basic payment at &euro;100,000.  The proposals also introduce a mechanism for member states to reduce direct payments above &euro;60,000 to a maximum of 85%.  Internal convergence will continue.  All farmers must reach a level of 85% of the national average entitlement by 2026.  Member states are expected to allocated 10% of direct payment funding to redistribute funding to small- and medium-sized farmers.  Member states will also have the choice to derogate from this option, provided they can demonstrate that the redistribution needs, nationally identified, are met by other instruments.<\/p>  <p>  With 27 member states, trying to put all of this together has been challenging.  An amount equal to 3% of the direct payments envelope would be spent on attracting and sustaining young farmers.  Direct payment top-ups, insulation aid and 50% of farm investment supports could count towards this 3% and the CAP will also include a social dimension.  Farmers and other beneficiaries will receive direct payments in that area to ensure strong employment conditions and so on.  Payments would be conditional on that.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith's point about national co-financing will pertain and the commitments made will be followed through on.  Many parties in this House objected to and opposed the &euro;1.5 billion carbon fund but it gives us the resources to help and support farmers in respect of a range of environmental schemes, separate to the environmental schemes that are being provided under the aegis of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I accept the Deputy's point that Irish farming has been one of the more progressive food production systems in reducing emissions, when compared to many other food production systems across Europe and the world.  Our dairy and beef industries are among the top performers in terms of their capacity to reduce emissions.  That said, the challenges of climate change mean we have to do more.  We want to work with and support the industry to enable that to happen.  The carbon fund gives us room to allocate additional funding in that regard, as do the national co-financing mechanisms.  We will continue to engage with the farming pillar through the social dialogue mechanism which we have re-established, and that is welcome.  I intend that to be a consistent part of our engagement with the industry and sector to ensure we can progress employment and maintain this vital industry across Ireland and rural Ireland, in particular.  It is vital to many towns and communities because of the employment it provides.  We want to sustain that employment and support farming in making the advances it continues to make in terms of carbon and production efficiency and in providing employment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000030#DD00300","speaker":"1458"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625056620,"counter":264,"content":"<p>Written Answers are published on the Oireachtas website.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Post-European Council Meeting: Statements","time":1625056620,"counter":265,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000030#DD00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1625056620,"counter":266,"content":"<p>I participated in a meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 June.  The agenda included Covid-19, economic recovery, migration, relations with Russia and Turkey, and the situation in the eastern Mediterranean.  We also discussed Belarus and adopted conclusions on Libya, the Sahel, Ethiopia and cybersecurity.  In addition, we had a discussion on LGBTQI equality.  Our meeting began with an exchange with the UN Secretary General.  We concluded on Friday with a meeting of the Euro Summit.  I will report on our discussions with the UN Secretary General and on Covid-19, economic recovery, Russia, Belarus, LGBTQI equality and the Euro Summit.  The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will address the remaining issues in his concluding remarks.<\/p>  <p>  In advance of the first session of the European Council, I met my counterparts from the Nordic and Baltic member states to discuss the agenda for the meeting.  I updated them on the current situation in Northern Ireland.<\/p> <p>We also agreed that we should take a clear stance on LGBTQI equality at the meeting.<\/p> <p> The European Council began with an exchange of views with the United Nations Secretary General, Mr. Ant&oacute;nio Guterres.  I emphasised the need for global multilateral co-operation to tackle the complex challenges we currently face.  The United Nations system cannot succeed without the constant support and engagement of its member states.  Ireland engages openly with all members of the Security Council but of course, we work particularly closely with our European Union partners.<\/p> <p> I also highlighted Ireland's work on some of the most pressing issues on the Security Council agenda.  These include supporting efforts to support the Iran nuclear agreement, working to ensure life-saving humanitarian assistance in Syria and drawing attention to the very serious situation in Ethiopia.  In response, the United Nations Secretary General paid warm tribute to the role that Ireland is playing, especially on Syria.  I very much welcome the European Council's engagement with the Secretary General, reflecting the strong co-operation between the European Union and the United Nations.  We share a strong commitment to fundamental values and attach the same urgency to addressing global challenges.  It is important that we work closely together.<\/p> <p> On Covid-19, our exchanges took stock of the good progress on vaccination across the member states and the overall improvement in the epidemiological situation.  Approximately 400 million doses have already been delivered across the European Union and close to 60% of the EU adult population has received at least one dose.  While continuing to advance our successful vaccination programmes, leaders agreed that continued vigilance and co-ordination is needed on the emergence and spread of variants of concern.<\/p> <p> We noted the agreements reached on the European Union digital Covid certificate, and on the revision of the two Council recommendations on travel within the European Union and on non-essential travel into the European Union.  These will be applied by member states in a manner that will help achieve the full return to free movement when the public health situation allows.<\/p> <p> The European Council also reaffirmed its commitment to continue to support global solidarity to ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines around the world.  This includes further clear actions to help boost global production in tandem with addressing supply and distribution bottlenecks.  We welcome the decision adopted by the Seventy-fourth World Health Assembly to set up a special session in November 2021 to discuss a framework convention on pandemic preparedness and response.  The European Union will continue working towards an international treaty on pandemics. <\/p> <p> Leaders also held an initial exchange on the lessons that can be learned from the pandemic on the basis of a report prepared by the Commission on 15 June 2021.  We invited the incoming Slovenian Presidency to take work forward in the Council to enhance collective preparedness, response capability and resilience to future crises, and to protect the functioning of the Internal Market.<\/p> <p> As I indicated to the House last week, while the European Union and its member states have accomplished much during the pandemic, there is room for stronger collective efforts in the sphere of public health, while acknowledging areas of national competencies.  There is scope to reduce unnecessary duplication of effort across member states, improve co-ordination and harness our collective strengths as we address common challenges.  The success of the vaccination programme shows us what can be achieved when we work together as a Union.<\/p> <p> On Thursday evening, European Council President, Charles Michel, facilitated an important discussion on LGBTQI equality and the importance of European Union values.  This was a passionate and serious discussion.  The European Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights.  These are enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.  There simply must be adherence to these values right across the European Union.  I was pleased to sign a joint letter with other leaders ahead of the meeting to mark Pride Day and in light of threats against fundamental rights, in particular, the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation.<\/p> <p> Last week, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, also co-signed a declaration to this end, led by the Benelux countries, at the General Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg.  We expressed our grave concern at Hungary's use of child protection as a pretext for introducing measures that violate freedom of expression and target a minority community.  It is simply not acceptable.  We urged the European Commission to use all the tools at its disposal to ensure full respect for European Union law.  The Commission has made clear that it will take any necessary action under the treaties.<\/p> <p> For my own part, I made very clear in my intervention that discrimination has real-world effects on our young people.  Discrimination starts on paper but ends up on our streets and in our schools.  I made clear Ireland's unambiguous national commitment to maintaining the values upon which the European Union is founded.  I took the opportunity to share with European Union leaders a discussion I had last November with Ruair&iacute; Holohan from Drogheda in the context of a UNICEF project on the rights of children.  Ruair&iacute; raised the issue of homophobic behaviour in schools, the difficulties for young people, teenagers in particular, as they come out, as well as the challenges and sometimes the hostility, our young people have to face.  I raised that in the context of the amendments to the Hungarian legislation that have been brought in by the Hungarian Parliament and Government.<\/p> <p> At the European Council on 24 and 25 May, we discussed the European Union's strategic relationship with Russia, and invited the Commission and the European External Action Service to present a report putting forward some policy options within the framework of the European Union's long-term agreed five principles for engagement with Russia.  These five principles are full implementation of the Minsk agreements, strengthened relations with Eastern partner countries and other countries of Central Asia, strengthening European Union resilience to Russian threats, selective engagement with Russia on certain issues, such as counterterrorism, and support for people-to-people contacts.  The analysis of the Commission and the European External Action Service is that relations between the European Union and Russia are unlikely to improve in the short term.  I share that analysis.  It is also important, however, that when the time is right, we are open to exploring paths that could change the current negative dynamics gradually into a more predictable and stable relationship.<\/p> <p> The limitations on fundamental freedoms in Russia and the shrinking space for civil society are of grave concern.  It is important that the European Union continues to support civil society, human rights organisations and independent media.  Leaders invited the Commission and the High Representative to put forward proposals on how to progress this objective.<\/p> <p> At last week's European Council meeting, European Union leaders agreed on the introduction of new restrictive measures against the Belarusian regime in response to the escalation of serious human rights violations, the forced landing of a Ryanair flight in Minsk on 23 May 2021 and the related detention of journalist Raman Pratasevich and of Sofia Sapega.<\/p> <p> The new targeted economic sanctions include the prohibition to directly or indirectly sell, supply, transfer or export to anyone in Belarus equipment, technology or software intended primarily for use in the monitoring or interception of the Internet and of telephone communications, and dual-use goods and technologies for military use to specified persons, entities or bodies in Belarus.  Trade in petroleum products, potassium chloride and goods used for the production or manufacturing of tobacco products is restricted.<\/p> <p> Furthermore, access to European Union capital markets is restricted and providing insurance and reinsurance to the Belarusian Government and Belarusian public bodies and agencies is prohibited.  The European Investment Bank will stop any disbursement or payment under any existing agreements with regard to projects in the public sector and any existing technical assistance service contracts.  Member states will also be required to take actions to limit the involvement in Belarus of multilateral development banks of which they are members.<\/p> <p> The European Union has now fully operationalised the concrete steps and strong response we agreed in May.  We have imposed clear costs on the Lukashenko regime for its flagrant disregard for international law.  In doing so, the European Union has acted in unity and in co-ordination with like-minded international partners.  We will continue to focus on supporting the Belarusian people in their defence of democratic principles and ensuring respect for their human rights.<\/p> <p> Central to that is making those responsible for the ongoing repression accountable for their unacceptable actions and pressing the authorities to adhere to their international commitments.  That is what Ireland and the European Union will continue to do, including during the ongoing 47th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council.<\/p> <p>We need to find a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis through a meaningful and inclusive national dialogue that leads to elections that are free and fair.  To achieve this goal, it is important to keep Belarus high on the international agenda and press the authorities there to adhere to their international commitments and obligations.<br\/><br\/>On Friday morning, we turned our attention to economic recovery.  The June European Council was an important opportunity for leaders to take stock on economic developments as we look ahead to the next phase of post-pandemic recovery.  As I indicated to the House last week, the key focus of this year's European semester process of economic governance is on the full and effective implementation of the &euro;750 billion Next Generation EU package.  Ireland submitted its draft national recovery and resilience plan to the Commission on 28 May.  Most member states have likewise submitted their plans, with a view to accessing funding under the recovery and resilience facility, which forms the centrepiece of the Next Generation EU package.<br\/><br\/>Last week, leaders reaffirmed in this context our shared commitment to the headline targets of the European Pillar of Social Rights action plan, consistent with the Porto declaration.  The essence of the Porto declaration, which we agreed at last month's social summit, is that the European ideal is first and foremost about improving the lives of our citizens.  The concrete employment, skills and poverty-reduction targets to be achieved by 2030 are an exemplar of the practical focus I believe is necessary in setting strategic direction for the period ahead.  It is very welcome that the social pillar continues to provide a clear political compass for our collective actions in responding effectively to 21st century challenges and opportunities, and equipping our citizens with the skills and capabilities for full economic and social participation.<br\/><br\/>At our euro summit meeting, leaders were joined by the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, and the president of the Eurogroup, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  The focus of our discussions was on the economic challenges for the euro area in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.  We acknowledged the strong, swift and co-ordinated economic policy response of the European Union and its member states in preparing the ground for a robust, inclusive and sustainable recovery from the pandemic.  We reiterated our commitment to completing banking union and strengthening the integration of our capital markets.  The Eurogroup has a strong mandate for advancing further work in this area over the coming months.  A further euro summit in December will review progress.<br\/><br\/>European Union-United Kingdom relations were not on the agenda of last week's European Council.  However, I took the opportunity <i>en marge<\/i>of the meeting to discuss recent developments with EU colleagues.  I emphasised the need to address issues in an environment of calm, without heightened rhetoric or drama.  As I said, the EU remains committed to finding every flexibility possible within the protocol to make it work as well as possible for businesses and citizens.<br\/><br\/>This was a long meeting with a number of sensitive internal and external issues on the agenda.  Not every meeting can lead to the immediate resolution of even the most pressing of issues.  Sometimes, however, the meetings of greatest substance and longest lasting impact are the ones such as this meeting, where the discussion was open, at times difficult, but at all times respectful.  It led us back to first principles; the core values of our Union that should guide all our decisions.  As I already indicated, the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will report on our discussions on other external relations issues, including Turkey, Libya, the Sahel and Ethiopia, as well as migration and cybersecurity.  I look forward to hearing Members' contributions to the debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000030#DD00500","speaker":"1458","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625057820,"counter":269,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for his statement.

This is a race we will lose unless the EU, along with other key international actors, takes immediate steps to facilitate the implantation of a universal vaccination programme.  We need to see real and unfettered support for the WTO vaccine waiver.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the ongoing determination of the EU and the US Administration in their efforts to protect the Good Friday Agreement and their commitment to the protocol and its implementation.  The pragmatic efforts of the EU to avoid confrontation over the protocol during the upcoming marching season are welcome.  The business, retail and farming communities in the North need the stability and protections the protocol offers.  Neither the DUP nor loyalist paramilitary representatives speak for the people of the North on the protocol.  There is no credible alternative available.  The full and smooth implementation of the protocol will offer the North a strategic platform from which to have ongoing access to the Single Market.  It will give businesses the certainty and stability they require.  The granting of observer status to representatives from the North at the European Parliament is critically important to addressing the democratic deficit.  I am interested to hear what measures the Government is taking to address this serious issue.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the comments of Josep Borrell Fontelles, who has described the situation in the Tigray region of Ethiopia as appalling.  I also welcome the condemnation by the European Council of the ongoing atrocities, ethnic and sexual violence and other human rights violations that are occurring there daily.  Commitments of support are not enough, however.  Tigray is on the cusp of a major famine, with the potential for devastating loss of life.  Action must be taken now.  Since the Council meeting, the Ethiopian Government has announced a unilateral ceasefire on humanitarian grounds.  While this is welcome, it does not take cognisance of the fact that, despite the retreat of the Ethiopian army following a number of heavy defeats in Tigray, Eritrean and Amhara forces are still fighting in the region.<\/p>  <p>  For the ceasefire to take effect, Eritrean and Amhara forces must withdraw from the region with immediate effect.  The EU needs to use its influence to ensure safe humanitarian corridors are opened to allow the resumption of aid to famine-threatened areas of the region.  Tigray forces have already stated they will facilitate and safeguard any humanitarian operations.  Every diplomatic effort needs to be made to ensure the Ethiopian authorities are not permitted to block essential humanitarian assistance in Tigray.  The EU and other international actors must also make every effort to initiate the withdrawal of Eritrean and Amhara forces in order to develop meaningful dialogue between the Ethiopian and Tigrayan Governments.<\/p>  <p>  The very justifiable anger visited upon the Hungarian leader Viktor Orb&aacute;n at the Council meeting was a welcome exhibition of European unity on an important human rights issue.  This discriminatory attack against the LGBTQI+ community in Hungary is a blatant act of politicking.  Hungary is an EU member state, with the duties and responsibilities this entails.  It is also a state that, under Mr. Orb&aacute;n, has been declassified as a democracy and deemed a hybrid regime by the NGO, Freedom House.  Mr. Orb&aacute;n has criticised NGOs, curtailed the media and academic freedoms, demonised migrants and asserted control over the Hungarian judiciary.  However, he is permitted to veto key EU initiatives.  This is absolutely unacceptable.<\/p>  <p>  There is no place within the European project for this form of behaviour.  The EU must act, and be seen to act, not just by Hungary but by other eastern European states that are entertaining right-wing, anti-democratic agendas.  Mr. Orb&aacute;n has driven a domestic political agenda through the othering of minority groups, including the LGBTQI+ community and migrants, to name just two.  It is important to note that Mr. Orb&aacute;n is currently under pressure as Hungary prepares to go to the polls next year.  Left to his own devices, he will push the country further to the right in order to polarise Hungarian society further.  The EU must act now on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The decision by EU leaders to address the pressing issue of migration by throwing cash at it, in the hope of keeping the problem at bay, is a matter of grave concern.<\/p> <p>Equally concerning however is the apparent ease with which the EU is prepared to overlook the aggressive intent of the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan in the Eastern Mediterranean where there are ongoing unresolved disputes with Greece and Cyprus.  The EU logic on that matter is that despite the fact that Erdo\u011fan has done little to resolve differences, the fact that the situation has not escalated since December, when the EU was advocating sanctions, is something we should applaud him for.  There are also serious concerns over human rights abuses in Turkey itself, particularly against the Kurdish community, including the repression of political parties.  Turkey&rsquo;s ambitions for an expansionist role as a regional power are also an instrumental factor in exacerbating the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.<br\/><br\/>The reality is that Europe is desperate to maintain Turkish co-operation in the creation of a <i>cordon sanitaire<\/i>on Europe&rsquo;s borders in order to keep out migrants.  When I use the term migrants, I am of course referring to those refugees who have fled in fear for their lives, from conflict zones, from death and sexual violence, from extreme poverty and from the growing impact of global warming.  The EU has already given Turkey &euro;4 billion, with another &euro;2 billion pending in payment under the same arrangement, to house some 3.7 million Syrian refugees in camps in Turkey.  Following last week&rsquo;s European Council meeting, EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, came to an agreement to pay Turkey an additional &euro;3.5 billion, over a period from 2021 to 2024, to continue to provide a bulwark between the EU and the millions of Syrian refugees who have fled their homeland.  The &euro;3.5 billion which is to be given to Turkey is part of a larger &euro;5.7 billion package that will fund other countries surrounding Syria.  This will result in a ridiculous situation where the EU will be paying Lebanon, amongst others, to house Syrian refugees, alongside funding the EU Frontex programme, which will be used to keep Lebanese refugees out of Europe.  The migrant policing package for Turkey is only part of a range of enticements the EU is looking at in order to keep Erdo\u011fan onside, with the possibility of a modernisation of the customs union, alongside moves to kick-start high-level discussions with Erdo\u011fan on a range of issues, from health to security.  We need to see a level of even-handedness in the approach of the EU towards states that engage in actions that are counter to the values and ethos the EU purports to stand for.<br\/><br\/>I conclude my remarks by bringing attention back to the fact that this House recently passed an historic motion on the issue of the illegal annexation of Palestinian lands by Israel, namely, that Ireland&rsquo;s stance is that illegal annexation has and continues to take place.  As we stand here this afternoon, Palestinian families are being forcibly evicted from their homes in Silwan in occupied East Jerusalem by armed Israeli crowbar brigades and are being forced to watch as their homes and businesses are torn down around them.  Thus, we have a responsibility to take this to Europe and argue and campaign for the triggering of appropriate sanctions against Israel.  I will listen with interest to see whether the issue was even discussed at the recent European Council meeting.  The Government must also move to implement fully the occupied territories Bill and give long overdue recognition to the state of Palestine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000032#FF00200","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625058420,"counter":271,"content":"<p>I am happy to speak very briefly on an important series of issues that were dealt with at the Council.  I am very heartened by the degree of strength presented at the Council in relation to the actions of Hungary.  The absolute fundamental <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre<\/i>of the EU is human rights, and that value system must be defended.  If any member state decides those shared fundamental values are not for them it is an issue.  The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, asked Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n of Hungary the very sensible question of whether the latter state should remain a member of the EU.  We cannot simply talk around these issues.  We are either a community of values or we have no values at all.  We must protect the LGBTI+ community in Hungary as strongly and with the same resolution as we defend all groups in our own society on the principles of equality.<\/p><p>The main agenda item of the Council continues to be Covid.  The EU digital green certificate for travel was progressed.  I understand that despite yesterday's announcements it is the Government's intention to participate fully in that certification system and to proceed on 19 July as already announced.  I would welcome a clear acknowledgement of that from the Minister of State.  The other major issue on this was the enhanced resolve towards preparedness for future pandemics in the form of enhancing the EU's response capability.  Its response, surveillance and all these aspects are immensely important but they need to be fleshed out and we must have details of that.  It is something that the Minister of State might present to a future meeting of the EU affairs committee.<\/p><p>On economic recovery, there are fundamental issues we need to talk about.  I can speak with some experience of the difficulties presented by the fiscal rules.  They are currently set to one side because of the pandemic but my concern is they will be re-enacted in the post-pandemic period when we will really need the wherewithal to ensure the very large sums of money which must be deployed can be deployed and that we are not going to have very pressurised fiscal rules disabling proper investment.  We must deal with issues in terms of our regeneration so we can invest in social and affordable housing, for example, and that we do not have either state aid rules or any other fiscal rules impacting on that.<\/p><p>I want to make mention of Belarus.  I said on the last occasion that we cannot lose sight of the fact that Mr. Roman Protasevich and Ms Sofia Sapega were taken off a flight travelling between two EU capitals.  We really need to ensure we constantly ratchet up the pressure on Belarus, incrementally, month-on-month, to ensure they and the thousands of other political prisoners are freed.<\/p><p>I want to mention another person as I have been asked to adopt an individual in prison in Belarus.  I want to put on the record of the House the case of Mr. Siarhei Verashchahin who is serving five years in a Belarussian penal colony for allegedly shouting at police officers from the window of his apartment.  He was brutally beaten on his arrest and then charged and imprisoned, as I said, for five years.  The case of Mr. Verashchahin and of the cases of thousands of others who are unjustly oppressed and locked up, as well as the suppression of any opposition within Belarus to what is an illegitimate regime, must be confronted.  It must be confronted now so those brave people who have taken to the streets over the last 18 months in particular do not feel abandoned by a European Union they look to as a beacon of light, leadership and liberty.  We as parliamentarians in our respective rights must not only stand shoulder to shoulder with their fundamental rights but be willing to act decisively to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000033#GG00200","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1625058420,"counter":272,"content":"<p>I thank the Taoiseach for a detailed synopsis of the important European Council meeting last week.  There are a number of points I would like to raise and indeed I have a couple of questions the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, might be able to address when he comes back in.  It is simply impossible to deal with all the issues that were covered at this really important Council meeting so I am going to focus on just four, two of which are related to each other.<\/p> <p> The first relates to the European Union's response to the continuing Covid-19 pandemic and where there is scope for a collective response.  I echo calls by other speakers on the rapid roll-out of the digital Covid certificate.  I know the Acting Chairman has been very vocal about that.  I ask the Minister of State to provide an update, if possible and as I requested in pre-Council meeting statements, on any engagement held or comparisons discussed between ministers and Heads of Government on approaches in dealing with the pandemic.  I refer in particular to approaches to dealing with the Delta variant of the virus, which is causing understandable concern in this jurisdiction, and how we can marry the approach in Ireland to what at this stage is a very different approach by our continental colleagues.  What can we learn?  It is never too late to learn more.  Are we following the exact correct path at this stage?  There is no doubt yesterday's announcement was disappointing for everyone - let us not pretend it was not - but we should not lose sight of the time and ability to defeat this pandemic through rapid vaccination.  There are other EU member states, including Belgium, that are ahead of us in the vaccination league table so we should see how we can learn from them now that the national immunisation advisory committee has given permission to open age cohorts that can be vaccinated.<\/p> <p> The recovery and resilience programme has already been submitted by the Government.  Will the Minister of State give an indication of when we can expect ratification of this from the European Union?  I know other member states are a bit more advanced on this.<\/p> <p> I will spend the final few minutes of my contribution on two matters that have been mentioned by all speakers.  The first is the engagement on the rights of our LGBTQI brothers and sisters across the Continent and the importance within the European Union of not just maintaining those rights but protecting them.  It would be churlish of me as a representative of the Fine Gael Party, which is part of the European People's Party, not to acknowledge that until very recently, Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n's Fidesz party was a member of our European political family.  It was suspended and then took the decision to leave that group.<\/p> <p> This is something we carry as a badge of shame, to be frank, for those of us who believe in a progressive centre-right and truly open vision of the social market economy espoused by the likes of Schuman, Merkel and many others.  However, it is never too late to right those wrongs and I commend the efforts of people like my colleague, Ms Maria Walsh, MEP, on bringing to the fore of the European conscience not just the need but the responsibility in every member state to maintain the rule of law and freedoms of which the European Union is so proud.  That is something that should continue.<\/p> <p> I share the thoughts of Deputy Howlin that perhaps the reflections of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte may need to be taken on board a little more seriously in Budapest.  I hope that in due course we look to expand the European Union, whether into the western Balkans or elsewhere, but this is not an optional buy-in.  Countries either agree to the terms of membership of the European Union or they should not apply.  Being a member of the European Union is a privilege for each and every one of the 27 member states but the opportunities and rights come with very clear responsibilities to every one of the citizens of the European Union, regardless of jurisdiction.<\/p> <p> In speaking about the rights of citizens I will conclude by referring again to the incident in Belarus and the ongoing fallout of the forced landing of an Irish-owned airliner travelling between two EU member state capital cities filled with EU citizens.  I very much welcome the continued work on sanctions but as I have said before in this Chamber, I hope the Minister of State will bring back the message that this is not a brief interlude.  It involves an EU carrier and EU citizens and we cannot turn a blind eye to what is going on in Belarus.  I implore the Government to take a critical stance at the European Council to ensure sanctions continue and work is ongoing to ensure rogue states like Belarus cannot carry on.  We saw a cyberattack in this jurisdiction in recent weeks.  These attacks come from rogue states like Belarus and the attackers have patrons in places like Russia, which simply turn a blind eye to criminal gangs wreaking absolute devastation, as we have seen in our health system.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000033#GG00300","speaker":"1473","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625059020,"counter":274,"content":"<p>The balance of the time slot is available to the Deputy if he wants to use it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000034#HH00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1625059020,"counter":275,"content":"<p>No, I am happy to pass to the next speaker.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000034#HH00300","speaker":"1473"},{"type":"speech","time":1625059020,"counter":276,"content":"<p>I thought the Acting Chairman was going to give me four minutes of Fine Gael time as well.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the strong remarks by the Taoiseach, the Minister of State and other Government representatives on the actions of the Hungarian Government.  As the previous speaker said, it is never too late to do right.  It is, however, disappointing it took so long for the Irish Government to take a stand against the Fidesz party, especially when we consider that one of the Government parties was in the same grouping in the European Parliament, happily accepting Fidesz votes when running for positions.  The truth is that when a former MEP, Senator Lynn Boylan, and others indicated as far back as 2015 the actions and natural outworking of such actions of the Fidesz party in Hungary, they were met by deafening silence from Fine Gael MEPs and the Irish Government.  I welcome the remarks and strong assertions by Government representatives over the past week but I hope we learn that we do not always have to wait until others publicly pronounce on these matters before an Irish Government can take a stand.<\/p>  <p>  A perfect place for us to take a stand is against another European government in breach of all basic tenets of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  I am referring to the Spanish Government in respect of the people of Catalonia.  I welcome that last week the Spanish Government pardoned with conditions elected representatives who had been imprisoned.  We should remember their crime, which was allowing people to vote and express their views.  When those people went to vote, they were met with a violent and oppressive reaction from the Spanish state.  The elected representatives who organised a vote in line with their pre-election commitments were imprisoned for that.  Many of those representatives are still in exile.  The Irish Government has not yet stood up for the democratic rights of those elected representatives.<\/p>  <p>  In the past 24 hours, we have learned that the Spanish Court of Auditors, forced through public pressure to release those political prisoners, is finding an alternative avenue of penalisation with financial penalties.  Again, this is for those people doing as they promised they would if elected.  Let us not repeat the mistakes of the past but instead take a stand as a small nation that has itself fought for the right to self-determination over several centuries.  We are uniquely and ideally placed to be an advocate for democratic values and self-determination for the Catalan people and all others.<\/p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste not to wait until others get in ahead of us so we can cling to their apron straps.  Let us take a stand as the proud nation we are in solidarity with another proud nation and the people of Catalonia.  Let us face up to the Spanish Government and tell it the values we have espoused so articulately over the past week apply to big member states as well as small member states.  They apply to political parties regardless of political group alignments in the European Parliament.  Let us tell the Spanish Government that the Irish people stand firmly and squarely on the side of self-determination.  It would be an honourable and brave action for us to take.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000034#HH00400","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1625059020,"counter":277,"content":"<p>The agreement on the new Common Agricultural Policy has been met with mixed responses.  The sooner the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine can provide clarity on key questions, especially for small and family farms, the better.  The Minister has pushed for national flexibility and now that he has it, we need to know what he will do with it.  We need to see the best outcome for a more sustainable and viable farming sector.  Family farming needs to be at the heart of the policy, as for too long factory-style farming has been promoted, which sees small farms being swallowed and practices that harm the land.<\/p>  <p>  Convergence has been set at 85% of the national average payment and although this is somewhat welcome, the Government should use its discretion to increase that figure.  We need the Minister to outline his plans for the transitional period and to know what rate of convergence will be applied for 2022.  What assurances do we have that the 25% of the direct payments budget set aside to fund new eco-schemes will be tailored to meet both the needs of small farms and address our climate and biodiversity crisis?<\/p> <p> The Agriculture and Fisheries Council also discussed fishing.  The Minister of State indicated that he raised the unilateral mackerel quota increases by Norway and the Faroe Islands, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s quota loss under the Brexit deal.  What are the concrete outcomes on these issues?  Fishing communities and their families from across the State travelled here to the convention centre last week.  What assurances can we give them as a result of this Council meeting?<\/p> <p> The European Council committed to help boost global production of and universal access to Covid-19 vaccines.  Without a waiver of the vaccine patents, however, this cannot be effectively achieved and those words ring very hollow.  Along with others, I have consistently called for Ireland to champion a waiving of the intellectual property rights on the vaccine, the so called trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver, to allow countries in the global south to produce their own supply.  The profits of corporations are being put ahead of the health of millions of people.  The pharmaceutical company monopolies could leave countries in the global south waiting until 2023 for widespread vaccination.  Not only is this morally reprehensible, it also leaves us open to new variants, such as the Delta variant, which is already having a massive impact here.<\/p> <p> If the Government is not motivated by human rights, can it at least act in self-interest?  To date, the Government&rsquo;s actions on this have been disgracefully inadequate.  The latest response is that we are working with the European Commission and other EU member states on the EU position on the TRIPS waiver.  In the middle of a pandemic, with a solution staring us in the face, we are working on a position when lives are being lost.  We must use our voice in the EU to support the TRIPS waiver by temporarily suspending intellectual property rights at the World Trade Organization for Covid-19 vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics.<\/p> <p> The people's vaccine alliance, representing a range of different groups from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation to the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Tr&oacute;caire, highlights the Irish people's desire for vaccine justice.  Scientifically and morally, the argument is incredibly clear, namely, that most effective way to end this pandemic is to ensure that everybody everywhere has access to vaccines.  The temporary waiving of patents will enable a sustainable increase in the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines.  This is the solution.  What is the Government doing to make it happen?<\/p> <p> I welcome the European Council&rsquo;s discussion of LGBTQI non-discrimination as a fundamental value of the EU.  This rhetoric must, however, be supported with action.  Hungary&rsquo;s law prohibits sharing content on homosexuality to people under the age of 18 in sex education, media, or ads.  Disgracefully, these restrictions were brought in under legislation relating to child abuse.  Poland&rsquo;s education minister has already said that Poland should copy the Hungarian law.  While our celebration of Pride is wonderful, we must not forget that solidarity is central to Pride.  It is about the discrimination, oppression, and violence inflicted on LGBTQ+ communities across the globe.  The Government has rightly called on the European Commission to take Hungary to court for violating EU norms.  What assurances can the Minister of State give us that these issues will continue to be pursued?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000034#HH00500","speaker":"1525","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625059620,"counter":279,"content":"<p>The social contract is a basic underpinning of our society, along with the hope and expectation that things will get better, that the lives we leave to our children will be better than the ones we have, and that the freedoms and qualities of life that we enjoy are going to be expanded and improved upon.  How terrifying it must be to live in a time and in a country where that contract is broken, where there is an erosion of those liberties, and where one observes things going from bad to worse.  It might be somewhat grandiose, but one thinks of the fall of Rome or 1930s Germany.<\/p><p>I worry when I look at the extraordinary temperatures we are seeing in Canada and across Siberia.  I worry about my children's future when it comes to climate breakdown.<\/p><p>In the context of these post-European Council meeting statements, I look at the erosion of civil liberties in some of our EU counterpart countries.  I echo many of the previous contributions, and Deputy Howlin's comments in particular, when reflecting on the unfolding situation in Hungary and the need to call out Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n and his unabated erosion of human rights and freedoms in his country.  This is not a recent thing.  This is the latest move by an Orb&aacute;n-led Government, but it builds on years of regressive policy and positioning.  While it is not hugely surprising, it is still deeply shocking to see this happen within a European context where we have come to take these liberties for granted.  The direction of travel was quite clear and quite worrying from the outset.  In 2010, the party introduced a new legal framework that effectively weakened legal checks on its authority, interfered with media freedoms and undermined human rights protections in that country.  In 2013, the Hungarian Government introduced provisions into its constitution that enabled the criminalising of homelessness and restricted the definition of the family.  In 2017, it adopted legislation that forced NGOs to identify themselves as foreign-funded if they receive finances equivalent to &euro;21,650 per year.  This move was a direct attack on democratic process in respect of which the NGOs play an invaluable role.  In early 2020, when Europe first faced the Covid-19 pandemic, Orb&aacute;n's Government gave him and his executive branch extraordinary powers to suspend certain laws and implement others by decree for as long as the emergency continues, completely sidestepping a parliamentary process.  These examples are just a snapshot of a steady but hugely damaging impact on the part of the Orb&aacute;n Government and the wider effect this is having on Hungary.<\/p><p>It was very welcome indeed to see the strong reaction of EU member states at the weekend, and especially the intervention of the Dutch Prime Minister.  After ten years of democratic erosion by an EU member state, however, it is time to go beyond a <i>status quo<\/i>response.  Recommendations are important but actions are what will lead to the necessary reversal and prevention of these discriminatory moves by an EU member state Government.  At last December's Council meeting, EU leaders struck an agreement on the rule of law.  The latter is an important step towards the protection of the rule of law and towards ensuring EU funds are not wrongly spent by those who attack the rule of law and fundamental rights.  In applying this new mechanism, the EU and its institutions also have a duty to protect the rights of final recipients and beneficiaries who are not responsible for rule-of-law violations.<\/p><p>We can fall into the trap of saying that sometimes governments take actions that are in no way representative of their people.  I would prefer to believe this to be the case, but a 2019 Eurobarometer poll found that 53% of Hungarians disagreed with the statement that there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex.  I do not believe that we in Ireland are immune to the same trend, and the trend towards populism.  We must be alive to it and aware of it.  All across the European context and in our own patch we must defend against it.  We must defend an independent media.  We have to very much encourage people to engage with that independent media to make themselves well informed and to resource themselves adequately to be able to participate fully in the democracy we are so lucky to live in.<\/p><p>If this is indeed part of a bigger picture within the EU, then the EU needs to face up to and address the disquiet among people of its member states, including what it is that causes the views to shift in a direction that undermines human rights and, to revert back to my opening, to have a look at that social contract.  We have seen this play out in western democracies, and not just in the EU.  It is happening across the Atlantic too, where people's feelings of disenfranchisement have led to a situation where they have voted in particular directions that may not be the best for our democratic institutions.<\/p><p>As country, Ireland has made significant progressive change over the past 30 or 40 years.  We absolutely should not take that for granted but with this in mind Ireland should very much work with its EU counterparts in helping to understand the origins of regressive policies.<\/p><p>As I have a few unexpected minutes remaining, I will pick up on the situation in Syria, which was in the initial speech laid out by the Minister of State.  The humanitarian situation we see unfolding in Lebanon and Turkey is very worrying.  We must make sure that we in Ireland live up to our obligations and our commitments.  We have a long history, which is often referenced, and we know what it is like for large numbers of people to have to leave their home place, and how important it is that they get a reception and opportunities in the countries to which they depart.<\/p> <p>To pick up on the issue of international vaccination, I also support the calls for a TRIPS waiver.  I do not think it is a silver bullet and I am on the record of the D&aacute;il as saying this.  It is one part of the puzzle.  Donations of excess vaccines from the EU will play an increasingly important part, as well as donations.  I do not think there is another way around scaling up the type of production we need to see in the vaccination process.  It needs to be massive.  As Deputy Cairns said, I would very much like to approach it from a moral standpoint but there absolutely is a case to be made in terms of self-interest.  In this case, nobody is safe until everybody is safe.  The best way to end the Covid pandemic as it exists throughout the world is to end it everywhere in a timely fashion, and to prevent vaccine escape, which is what we are all very worried about, and we see elements of it in the Delta variant as we know it somewhat bypasses the first dose of AstraZeneca.  We need to massively ramp up the vaccination programme not just in the developed world but in the developing world also.  There is a strong case to be made in this regard for the TRIPS waiver.  With regard to building this into WHO rules, if not now, when?  This is a question I will leave with the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000035#JJ00200","speaker":"1617","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625060220,"counter":281,"content":"<p>I hope the Taoiseach discussed the prospects of Irish unity at the recent European Council meeting.

In the scale of things, the following might not be a big issue but I have been contacted by many people last night and today who are very upset.  They are the parents of children, and they are very angry and frustrated about how the cancellation of confirmations and communions was communicated.  An off-the-cuff remark by the T&aacute;naiste at the end of a press conference is not good enough.  People have spent the year calling for clarity and clear communication.  When announcements such as that made yesterday are being made it is important these communications are made clearly and correctly in order that we do not have people not knowing what is happening.  Events have been organised for schools in Cork on Monday and Tuesday and parents have contacted me, as have parish priests.  They are going ahead and no one has given them clarity.  It is unfair and disrespectful to people who are following all the public health guidelines and the Government's timeline.  There needs to be clarity on this.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to LGBTQI and equality, what Hungary has done over the years, and what it has been allowed to get away with it, completely goes against everything the European Union and we stand for.  I am glad to see people are finally standing up but this type of behaviour cannot be acceptable in a European Union, which should be equal to all.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000036#KK00200","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1625060220,"counter":282,"content":"<p>The continued refusal of the EU to back the TRIPS waiver of intellectual property on Covid vaccines is an absolute scandal.  It is a clear example of profit before people.  It is about protecting the intellectual property and rights of the big pharmaceutical companies.  It is about doing that now so they can profit from the Covid vaccines in the future.  More fundamentally, it is about protecting their intellectual property and their rights to intellectual property in future because they fear conceding at this point on the morality of ensuring the world is vaccinated, as the health of the entire world population needs the rapid roll-out of vaccines, which means generic production and distribution throughout the world.  They fear if they were to accept this, then, rightly, at the next point, in terms of AIDS medicine, hepatitis medicine or whatever, people would ask why the big pharmaceutical companies get to withhold and restrict the production of these, putting their own profits first.<\/p>  <p>  I also have to say the Government, the EU and the US like to hide behind COVAX.  COVAX is a completely inadequate response to the crisis.  It is about them being able to say they are giving the vaccines to those who need them, while defending the essentials of the intellectual property.  What they do not speak about are the non-transparent agreements between these countries and the pharmaceutical companies.  What they also do not speak about is the fact COVAX is only designed at its best to provide one in five of those who need it with vaccines in the fewer than 100 countries selected.  It is completely inadequate and the poorest countries in the world have to buy more vaccines on the international market.<\/p>  <p>  I also want to make a point on the horrific homophobic actions of the far-right Hungarian Government.  We should remember the leading party, Fidesz, led by Viktor Orb&aacute;n, was a sister party of Fine Gael until earlier this year, when it chose to leave the European People's Party.  In government it has attacked workers' rights.  It has attacked the rights of the Roma people.  It has engaged in quite disgusting racism against them and against migrants and in spreading anti-Semitism.<\/p>  <p>  LGBTQ+ people have consistently been in the sights of the Hungarian Government as targets of discrimination and oppression.  The latest attack is a law that bans the portrayal of homosexuality among those aged under 18.  It means no gay people in advertisements.  It means no sex education relating to LGBTQ people.  It means sex education will be carried out only by agencies approved by this ultraconservative Government.  We can obviously guess what kind of agencies those will be.  One of the most disgusting parts of this is how the Hungarian Government, in a classic right-wing trope which we have also seen in this country, links the question of homosexuality with paedophilia in a disgusting attempt to slur and slander LGBTQ+ people.  Its aim very clearly is to push gay people out of public life and make them feel ashamed and to legitimise widespread homophobia in society.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of this law, the repression that exists and the violence against LGBTQ+ people, which is positively encouraged by the right-wing Hungarian Government, I salute, pay tribute to and express solidarity with LGBTQ+ activists within Hungary who have continued to fight for their rights, to stand out and to organise Pride events in the course of this week, and who say they are willing to do so even if it means civil disobedience.  The question is what will the EU do about this.  We have heard strong words of condemnation but what will the EU do about it?  It is well able to talk about democracy and human rights but in terms of action, the only action the EU ever takes in terms of anything that happens within its borders is when governments, countries or states go against the EU neoliberal fiscal orthodoxy or threaten to do so.<\/p> <p>We had the example of Ireland being told a bomb would go off, not in Frankfurt but in Dublin, if an attempt was made to burn the bondholders.  We saw the power of the European Central Bank used to strangle the Greek banking system because Greece had the temerity to elect a government which had a mandate to reject austerity, though it did not follow through on that mandate.  However, again and again, we see no action on human rights, democratic rights or opposition to oppression within the EU. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000036#KK00300","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625060820,"counter":284,"content":"<p>Deputy Crowe is sharing with Deputy Flaherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000037#LL00200","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1625060820,"counter":285,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and the Taoiseach for the comprehensive report on the European Council meeting.  I will hone in on three aspects.  The first is Belarus.  In the past 48 hours I have signed paperwork and been in contact with an NGO called Libereco.  I  am one of a group of European parliamentarians who have adopted, if one likes, Belarusian prisoners.  There are 503 of them who have been detained for speaking out and protesting against the Lukashenko regime.  I have adopted Siarhei Hatskevich.  He is a 17-year-old high school student who faces three years' imprisonment for his actions protesting against the despotic regime that has run his country for many years.  That adoption entails speaking when I can in this Chamber about his plight and writing many letters across Europe and beyond to try to secure his freedom.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I will speak on Covid.  That was well covered at last week's European Council meeting.  I have been looking at our statistics in Ireland.  Two thirds of adults have received their first dose and under half of the adult population has been fully vaccinated.  Some 330,000 vaccines are being administered per week.  It is going well.  On 19 July, international travel will be possible with the digital green certificate.  The public health advice from 19 July onward is that the fully vaccinated can leave our shores, go around Europe and the world and enjoy a holiday overseas or travel for any reason.  That is the guidance.  In the case of those who are not vaccinated, they can still travel, while taking their own precautions.  There are risk levels and certain boxes one has to tick.<\/p>  <p>  Would that guidance for international travel not dovetail and fit well, over the coming weeks, with domestic hospitality?  What if we took the available medical advice and told the fully vaccinated they can go wherever they want in this country.  That should be a given.  For those not fully vaccinated, there is a certain risk level.  I  would argue it is low at the moment, given that so much of our population is vaccinated, given that the key metric all along was deaths and they have gone way down and given that the older cohorts have been vaccinated.  Covid has become more manageable.  The criteria we will apply from 19 July in allowing people to travel internationally also would work quite well on the domestic front.  Those who are vaccinated can go ahead.  Those who are not vaccinated could also enjoy those freedoms but they would carry a certain risk on their shoulders.  That would be a sensible way forward.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I will make a point on fishermen.  They docked up here this day last week.  There is only a small number of trawlers operating out of County Clare and I do not claim to be an expert on the fishing industry but I took time out to board a vessel and speak with the skipper and crew.  The time has come to push back in Europe on off-coast fishing.  There is an equivalent of Flightradar24 called Shipfinder.  It shows, at any given time, a flotilla of ships of the west coast of Ireland, all registered to Spain and fishing in our waters.  There needs to be a big pushback at European level to secure the future for our fishermen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000037#LL00300","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625060820,"counter":286,"content":"<p>Many of the country's leading value-added food producers are increasingly concerned about likely threats and implications of the high-level border operating model for products of animal origin.  We are fortunate to have a number of these significant employers based in County Longford.  A number of those enterprises have sister facilities in the UK so are already well aware of the shortcomings with this system and have flagged some of their concerns in recent months.<\/p>  <p>  At the core of the stipulations to come into effect from 1 October is a requirement for a veterinary surgeon to be present at the plant and confirm and sign off as each load is despatched from the plant.  Many of theses enterprises work six or seven days a week, running 24-hour operations in real time with trucks leaving the plant with a short window, in most instances, to make their ferry connection.  Based on their experiences in England, some businesses have seen an impact on their business model in the region of six figures in quarter 1 this year.  A number of businesses are engaging with the office of the chief veterinary officer and this has been a very positive engagement.  In order for the process to work as currently envisaged, it would require the employment of scores of additional veterinary surgeons across the country to ensure compliance.  There have been suggestions that technical officers could be brought in to supervise the loading and, at a later stage in the day, the vet would come in and sign these off; however, a number of the companies I am speaking to have highlighted that this will not work and some of the port authorities they intend to travel through are enforcing the regulations to the letter of the law.  France is operating a light touch but in Rotterdam, it is enforced to the letter of the law.  There is a concern that when our trucks arrive in Rotterdam they will be turned back unless complying with regulations to the letter.  <\/p>  <p>  I understand there has been engagement between officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but I am in no doubt it will require input from the Minister of State.  We urgently need to see movement on a solution for this issue.  I know the Minister of State and his officials will work assiduously with both Departments to ensure some of our blue-chip food producers and most significant employers are not adversely affected.<\/p>  <p>  I had an opportunity to raise the matter with An T&aacute;naiste at the enterprise committee this morning.  He is well aware of the issues and I was pleased to see that.  I am hopeful he will work towards a resolution.  I have also been in contact with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  One of the significant employers I referenced has extended an invitation to that Minister to come to the plant in Longford and see in real time how this may, and most likely will, impact on them unless we find a resolution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000037#LL00400","speaker":"1597"},{"type":"speech","time":1625060820,"counter":287,"content":"<p>I reiterate some of what has been said in relation to the need for global solidarity.  We all see the Delta variant involves an element of chickens coming home to roost in relation to the failure to have a global solution to the vaccination problem.  We need to put that in place as soon as possible.<\/p>  <p>  I add my voice in support of the need for a TRIPS waiver.  We are told by others at a European level that there is no need for this and it is a misnomer.  If that is the case, can they offer us a solution for the developing world?  Deputy Paul Murphy and many others said that if we talk about COVAX being a solution only for 20% of the population in the developing world, we can guess what sort of prices will be charged to the remainder and to developing countries that do not have those sort of resources.  That might make sense for a pharmaceutical company looking to make money.  Unfortunately, for world health it is a disaster.  We will leave breeding grounds for more variants.  We have seen with every variant it becomes much worse.  They are the rules of virology and epidemiology.  The virus adapts to make itself more transmissible and, in this case, it looks like it is also far more dangerous.  We are dealing with the outworkings of that.<\/p>  <p>  I raise another matter on which we need to have conversations across Europe.  I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, earlier.  He had indicated a possible softening of the Government position on antigen testing.  <\/p> <p>A considerable number of people in the wider world, in the scientific world and even in this illustrious Chamber believe that antigen testing is a tool that we are missing but one that could help with a solution for the hospitality sector.  We are well beyond the time of holding pilots.  Pilot programmes have been carried out throughout Europe.  We need to examine the information from those and see what is applicable as soon as possible.<\/p> <p> We welcome the solidarity that Ireland has been shown, particularly on the Irish protocol, but we need this issue dealt with from the point of view of it being the only show in town.  It is destabilising the North at this point in time, where some people see the British Government using certain language that probably sits well with its own base and leads people to believe that the Irish protocol will be done away with.  We see it in the same way as we see the Good Friday Agreement, in that they are international agreements and are here to stay.  We need to find solutions to people's problems.  We support the Irish Government in that regard.<\/p> <p> I welcome the Narrow Water bridge project.  Has the shared island unit discussed seeking European moneys for its delivery?

I note from the press releases that a number of conclusions were agreed between member states and I would like to highlight a number of these.<\/p>  <p>  It is noted that the European Council welcomes the good progress being made on the vaccination roll-out and the gradual improvement in the overall situation.  It also stresses the need to continue the vaccination efforts and to be vigilant of the emergence and spread of new variants.  I welcome these statements, but I wish to ask the Minister of State a number of questions on them.  Will he confirm that he raised the issue of the supply of vaccines and did he receive a commitment that all promised supplies would be delivered as promised and on time?  Will he also confirm whether he discussed the approach that Ireland was taking to lockdown and how this compared with other member states?  The fact that we are the only member state that currently does not allow indoor hospitality makes me wonder why other countries are not taking this approach and why we are not taking the approach of other member states.  Will the Minister of State please address this point?  Surely we must fight this pandemic as a united front and not take a different approach to our European members.  The simple fact is that the hospitality sector is facing another summer of ruin, not through any fault of its own, but because of recent decisions taken by the Government.  What evidence have we to make our approach different from the rest of Europe's?<\/p>  <p>  Another upsetting aspect is the fact that first holy communions and confirmations are not permitted to go ahead.  This beggars belief.  I have been inundated with calls from angry clergy, school principals and parents all week as a result of this ridiculous situation.  I know families that have cancelled holidays and got everything ready so that their loved ones could make their first holy communion or confirmation.  It is a ridiculous situation when there are large churches around the country that could take 1,000 or 1,500 people.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste this morning mention that he loved going to the cinema and that there would be four or five seats between people, yet he will not let children have their first holy communions and confirmations.  It is a disgrace.<\/p>  <p>  Did the Minister of State discuss our approach to Covid with his European counterparts and get an explanation as to why they were able to open up society fully and we could not?  Many of the Deputies present have been watching UEFA Euro 2020 over the past number of weeks.  What is really annoying is that those countries were able to host matches when we could not.  Did the Minister of State inquire of his European counterparts why this was the case?<\/p>  <p>  I wish to put on record my annoyance with the approach the Government has taken to hospitality this week.  What evidence does the Government have to justify this approach and why are our European neighbours taking a different approach?  It makes no sense.  In order to beat this pandemic, we must have the full backing of the public, but I fear we are losing it.<\/p>  <p>  I do not support the approach discussed yesterday that fully vaccinated people could return to indoor hospitality after 19 July.  This does not make any sense.  The majority of people working in restaurants and pubs are of the younger generation and are less likely to be vaccinated.  To put that in perspective, they will be allowed to work in pubs and restaurants but will not be able to visit those pubs or restaurants with friends.  Where is the logic in that?  Words fail me.<\/p>  <p>  To conclude on Covid-19, the European Council stated that it had reached agreement on the EU digital Covid certificate and on the revision of the two Council recommendations on travel within the EU and non-essential travel into the EU.  It also stated that each member state would apply the recommendations in a manner that ensured the full return to free movement as soon as the public health situation allowed.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could elaborate on this and outline exactly what approach we will be taking and if we will be in line with the rest of Europe.  I welcome the Council's statement that it will continue to work towards an international treaty on pandemics.<\/p>  <p>  The European Council issued a statement on economic recovery.  The Commission welcomed the entry into force of the \"own resources\" decision, which will enable it to start borrowing resources for Next Generation EU to support a full and inclusive recovery and help the Union transition to green and digital economies.  I note that the Council is encouraging member states to move forward on their national recovery and resilience plans so that they can get the full benefits of the fund.  Will the Minister of State update the House on this and where we are with our plan?  The funding, which is available under the recovery and resilience facility, will be vital in helping to get our economy back up and running.  We do not want a situation where our application is buried in red tape, slowing down the availability of these much-needed funds.  An update would be welcome.<\/p>  <p>  I note that the European Council issued a statement condemning the recent malicious cyberattack against member states, including Ireland and Poland.  It also stated that it invited the Council of Ministers to explore appropriate measures within the framework of the cyberdiplomacy toolbox.  With the greatest of respect, we need more than an invitation to take action against this attack.  We need real action and a real commitment from the EU that we will be supported against these terrible cyberattacks.  Will the Minister of State update the House on this matter and elaborate on any action the European Council discussed to protect us from these types of attacks?<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's replies to my questions, in particular those on the lockdown approach and why we are taking such a different approach to indoor hospitality as the rest of Europe.  I welcome the &euro;3 million that has been provided to take the Narrow Water bridge project to a further stage.  The project has been ongoing for a long time.  I would like to see the relationship between the North and South continue.<\/p>  <p>  My questions are valid and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State gave me a decent reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000038#MM00200","speaker":"1600"},{"type":"speech","time":1625061420,"counter":290,"content":"<p>I understand that Deputies Alan Farrell and O'Connor are sharing time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000038#MM00300","speaker":"1617"},{"type":"speech","time":1625061420,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Alan Farrell for allowing me to speak during his time.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about some of the actions announced by the Government yesterday, in particular the initiatives being undertaken to prepare for the return of international travel.  This is something for which many people working in the aviation industry have been waiting for a long time.  However, I am hearing from some of them that they are concerned about the Government's preparations for the return of international travel on 19 July, particularly the implementation of the digital green certificate.  Will the Minister of State please tell the House whether the system is ready to be implemented on that date?  There is no excuse not to be prepared.  The aviation industry, be it our airlines or airports, does not need to be dealing with unnecessary administration in terms of processing people who are engaging in international travel.  Speaking as a Deputy, I encourage anyone to get onto an aircraft and go on holiday or engage in non-essential travel come 19 July, just as has been happening for some time in every other European country in the Schengen area with an advanced vaccination rate.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland's approach to Covid-19 has been deeply disappointing.  I do not know whether I am being patronised or people just think they know better, but the line I am often given as a young man in the D&aacute;il is that Ireland needs to follow scientific advice.<\/p>  <p>Countries with much greater resources in terms of government scientific advisers are taking more liberal approaches to the reopening of their economies compared with Ireland.  Yesterday, we saw another indication of that.  It came as an enormous disappointment to people working in the hospitality industry, specifically restaurateurs, publicans and hoteliers who wanted to resume indoor dining for non-residents.  We need to get our act together.  As a Government Deputy, from talking to people on the ground in my constituency, I must say that people extremely disappointed with the pace of progress with reopening of our economy.  We must do more.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000038#MM00400","speaker":"1516","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625062020,"counter":293,"content":"<p>I am always happy to accommodate a colleague.  In pre-European Council meeting statements in the House, Deputy O'Connor and I expressed deep concern about our preparedness for the return of international aviation.  Many other Deputies share that concern.  The Government has said precious little about it in the House.  That is problematic in the context of the preparedness we discussed yesterday for the hospitality sector.  Aviation is a sector that requires preparations weeks in advance in order to plan.  I have my concerns and clarity has been sought on the matter.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to relay those concerns to his colleagues.<\/p>  <p>  On the outcomes of the European Council meeting, I was proud that the Irish Government and other EU governments sent a strong message to the Hungarian Government about its stance on LGBT rights.  Anti-LGBT laws introduced in Hungary go against the core principles of the European Union and all its citizens, regardless of colour, creed or sexual orientation.  All people should be equal before the law and respected by their respective governments.  The actions of Hungary and Poland in recent months and years have been an affront to EU citizens regardless of geography.  We cannot turn a blind eye to the increasingly regressive approach taken by some member states.<\/p>  <p>  I echo the comments made by some previous speakers.  This is a moment in European history that we will look back on and we may ask why we did not do more.  My colleague, Deputy Richmond, referenced the Fidesz party's presence in the European People's Party, of which Fine Gael is a proud member.  The European People's Party acted far too late but the correct course of action came to pass in the end.<\/p>  <p>  The European project, a collection of nations with 450 million citizens, must ensure there are mechanisms in place whereby if the rights of citizens in certain member states are not being honoured, actions and steps can be taken to vindicate those rights.  In the future, such moments will be considered as defining for the European Union.  At a time when authoritarian governments are on the rise across the globe, we, as committed Europeans who are committed to peace and democracy, should take a firm and unequivocal stance against regressive behaviours within our ranks.  In doing so, we will send a message to the wider world that social progress and freedoms will be defended.<\/p>  <p>  I welcome the consideration given during the European Council meeting to hold a special session in November 2021 to discuss the framework convention on pandemic preparedness and response and continue to work towards the development of an international treaty with regard to future pandemics.  That is a welcome step taken by the European Union.  It is unfortunate that as the global population increases, the more likely it is that we will uncover or release - whatever way one describes it - future pandemics.  Unfortunately, scientists have warned us of the occurrence of more regular pandemics in the future.  We live in a connected world where even uninhabited islands in the Pacific are regularly visited by humans.  The deepest, darkest jungle is not too far away and, on that basis, future pandemics may arise.<\/p>  <p>  To refer briefly to the debate on the TRIPS waiver, I had to bite my tongue when I listened to one Deputy speaking about the responsibilities of the western world.  A TRIPS waiver is a great idea.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, stated, it is a component of the response the world should give to the global south.  It is like providing ingredients for a recipe, in that there is not much point in providing ingredients to somebody who does not have a kitchen.  For us to response appropriately as rich nations, we should provide vaccines to the global south or we should ensure the likes of the TRIPS waiver is applied in countries where such vaccines can be mass-produced and provided to the global south.  That is the solution to a global pandemic and the answer to the question as to when we will all be safe.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000039#NN00200","speaker":"1562"},{"type":"speech","time":1625062020,"counter":294,"content":"<p>I, too, will return to the pre-European Council meeting statements made in the House some time ago.

We saw this week that the economic recovery here is on a knife edge in terms of the ongoing restrictions and draconian measures put in place, which will force many small businesses to close their doors permanently.  When I speak about small businesses I mean business that have been passed down through generations in Irish families.<\/p>  <p>  The fact that NPHET is now governing this country, rather than the Government of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, is nothing short of a disgrace.<\/p> <p>NPHET has a mandate to give advice.  It does not have a mandate to govern this country, and never will.  It must be strongly challenged in this House because what the Government has done to businesses is absolutely unjustifiable.  Many businesses had put in their orders.  This did not happen anywhere else in Europe.  That is why I am raising it in the context of statements on the European Council meeting.  It did not happen in any other European country.  Those countries have not prohibited indoor dining.  However, this Government does not seem to be standing up for its own people.  In fact, it appears to be betraying every sector of society.  We need only look at the fishermen, the farmers and the small businesses the Government has helped to destroy.<\/p> <p> In the context of the CAP reforms, what is on the table is totally unacceptable.  It is causing much division in different sectors of agriculture.  The Minister must step up to the mark and fight for the Irish agriculture sector, which is in grave danger.  A transition payment, the results-based environment-agri pilot project transition payment, has been put in place, but that is unacceptable too.  There should have been a base payment of &euro;10,000 for farmers while we wait for the CAP reforms to come into effect in 2023.<\/p> <p> In the broader recovery, some &euro;500 million of the EU's Covid-related recovery and resilience facility for Ireland will be spent on reducing carbon emissions.  The Government seems to have an obsession with that, to the detriment of its own people.  This means that more than 50% of the &euro;1 billion loan provided by the EU will be for green initiatives such as a loan scheme for refitting homes.  Will the Government just wake up and put the climate action Bill where it deserves to go, namely, into the recycling bin?  The Government must wake up.  It is going beyond what the EU is asking it to do and it is betraying the people in this country, which is shameful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000039#NN00700","speaker":"1592","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625062620,"counter":299,"content":"<p>I have two and a half minutes so I will only mention one or two issues.

There was a broad range of topics at the Council meeting, but it is unfortunate that the Taoiseach failed to include Turkey.  He mentioned that the Minister of State will deal with that, but this is of central importance and he should have clarified what is going on with regard to Turkey.  The European Council expressed concern about the targeting of political parties, human rights defenders and media, which it said represents a major setback for human rights and runs counter to Turkey's obligation to respect democracy, the rule of law and women's rights.  However, it went on to refer to the EU's strategic interest in a stable and secure environment in the eastern Mediterranean and in the development of a co-operative and mutually beneficial relationship with Turkey.  We see <i>realpolitik<\/i>on the ground with regard to human rights and Turkey, the EU's sixth largest trading partner.<\/p><p>Despite the EU's concerns about human rights, it is happy to close borders to refugees and outsource the problem to Turkey, where over 1 million Syrian refugees do not have work permits, almost 400,000 refugee children are not in school and 64% of urban Syrian households live close to or below the poverty line.  I could pick any number of statistics.  In fact, I understand Turkey is doing its best.  My difficulty is with its human rights record and with the EU outsourcing to Turkey.  We do not have a very good record ourselves.  I am not complaining or giving out about Turkey.  I am saying that <i>realpolitik<\/i>pushes human rights aside.  We can look at Poland, Hungary and Belarus, and rightly so, but when it comes to Turkey, we close our eyes because it is so important.  I make this contribution in the context of the UN Refugee Agency telling us that 82.4 million people are forcibly displaced worldwide.  Of that figure, 26.4 million are refugees, 4.1 million are asylum seekers and there are 48 million internally displaced persons.  My point is that we must look at what is happening and how we are developing fortress Europe by outsourcing and paying Turkey to do a job that we should be considering.<\/p><p>Finally, I would love to see intellectual property rights on an agenda for the EU Council, including the cost of the indemnity, the cost of the vaccine and, most importantly, openness in respect of the intellectual property right and producing a vaccine on a not-for-profit basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000040#OO00500","speaker":"1577"},{"type":"speech","time":1625062620,"counter":303,"content":"<p>There will now be a 20-minute question-and-answer session, after which the Minister of State will have five minutes to conclude.

Almost none of them, except Turkey, has been raised in the debate but they are very important.  I will speak on Turkey at the end of the debate as there is quite a detailed script on it.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to the vaccines, we are very hard on ourselves in this Chamber as regards what the European Union in doing about vaccines.  At every European Council, General Affairs Council and health ministers Council there has been extensive discussion on vaccines and Covid-19.  Of course, there is sharing of experience and information.  The decision was taken to come together as one on vaccination and it is fair to say that it has been very much in our interest.  It has also been an extraordinary success.  The official figures are not published daily but, according to what Professor MacCraith announced, Ireland is after Malta at the top of the vaccine distribution list.  That is a great credit to the system, workers, volunteers and administration here and the Government in terms of rolling it out.<\/p>  <p>  There is also the global vaccine supply, which is very important.<\/p> <p>I share the genuine moral and practical health concerns of everybody here regarding getting everyone around the world vaccinated.  Let us not forget that the European Union is the largest exporter of vaccines in the world.  Europe has shown great moral leadership on global vaccine sharing.  We have not closed the door, and that has been to our own disadvantage because many more of us would have been vaccinated if we had an export ban in place.  Regarding our manufacturing capacity, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh mentioned the other issues apart from the TRIPS waiver.  However, our vaccine manufacturing capacity will be of far greater help to the developing world than a TRIPS waiver which may allow production but would not address the question of where that production is going to take place.  It would probably end up taking place within the European Union.<\/p> <p> Therefore, efforts are being made to share technical know-how because it is very difficult to manufacture vaccines.  Ireland, with Pfizer, is going to start being a part of the manufacturing process.  It is not possible, however, to simply repurpose pharmaceutical factories for vaccine production.  Such facilities generally have to be specially designed.  EU member states have committed to donating at least 100 million doses of vaccine by the end of 2021.  The G7 talks referred to donations of 870 million doses.  Therefore, the EU&rsquo;s participation in those recent G7 discussions, which agreed that additional commitment for the provision of vaccines globally, was very important.  The EU submitted a proposal on 4 June to the TRIPS council regarding a global trade initiative for equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics.<\/p> <p> I reiterate, however, that production capacity is the key issue.  Apart from our own manufacturing capacity, the European Commission announced &euro;1 billion in funding for the building of production capacity in Africa to create long-term sustainable production capacity on that continent.  Therefore, we are doing a great deal in the European Union.  I share people's concerns in this regard but a massive amount is being done and but for the European Union, the rest of the world would be in a much worse place.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000040#OO01000","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625063220,"counter":309,"content":"<p>Deputy Connolly wishes to come in again.

First, I want to follow up on TRIPS and the need for a waiver in that regard.  I want to challenge the Minister of State, and I think it is the correct thing to do, regarding his statement that the world would be in a much worse position without the EU.  The reality is that the Delta variant is now wreaking havoc across the world because of the failure of the global community to address the issue of intellectual property rights.  The longer we drag our heels as an international community in addressing the fundamental issue here, the greater the likelihood of more variants arising.  To use a well-rehearsed phrase, until everyone is out of this, no one is out of this.  Therefore, the international community, the Government and the European Union have an obligation to lead on this issue and to waive intellectual property rights and, if necessary, to provide the facilities to allow countries the means to develop and install the required infrastructure.  We are not going to be out of this situation in the next 12 months, so there is going to be a long-term need in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Second, I turn to the motion regarding Israeli annexation passed by the Oireachtas last month.  While there were many statements on Belarus, and rightly so, and much talk about sanctions being imposed on Russia and other measures being taken, there was a distinct lack of a single mention regarding the passing of the motion in this D&aacute;il concerning the illegal actions of Israel in annexing Palestinian land.  What measures are going to be taken in that regard are equally important.  The failure of the Government to address this point or to raise it at European level is concerning.  As we sit here, more than 1,500 Palestinians are being forced out of their homes in the Silwan area of occupied East Jerusalem as their houses are pulled to the ground and not a word has been mentioned at the European Council level.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this issue and address why there is such hypocrisy at European level.  We are quick to impose sanctions on other countries and regimes but we allow Israel to continuously breach international and humanitarian law and abuse human rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000041#PP00700","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1625063220,"counter":315,"content":"<p>I think we have the Deputy's questions.

More importantly, and Deputy Brady asked about this aspect, I refer to supporting manufacturing capacity in Africa and putting significant resources into that endeavour, apart from what our own manufacturing capacity is doing.  Turning to the issue of Israel and Palestine, it is fair to say that the motion from this D&aacute;il went out far and wide and was heard across the world.  Not every member state of the European Union would agree with this motion.  Quite a few would disagree with it.  I am being frank about that.  I am not saying that they are right or wrong, it is simply a fact.  The issue of Palestine and Israel was not part of the conclusions of the European Council on this occasion, but the issue does arise regularly and the Irish view is put forward strongly.  It may have been raised at the Foreign Affairs Council but I am not sure because I do not sit on it.  The Deputy will have to ask the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about that aspect.  It is an issue, however, which is regularly discussed.<\/p>  <p>  On all these foreign policy issues, particularly in the European Council, it is a fact that every member state has a veto on conclusions.  It would equally apply to us if we did not like them.  Not every member state of the European Union will agree with the motion that all of us here supported 100%.  That is just a fact of life.  Our moral voice, though, is very strong on this issue.  The unified voice of this D&aacute;il spoke out to the world regarding the annexation.  The motion mandates the Government in this regard, not only at European Union, but at the United Nations Security Council.  We will probably be more effective in that forum because we are members of it, but again global politics are involved there as well.  However, we certainly punch very far and high above our weight on this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000041#PP00900","speaker":"1503"},{"type":"speech","time":1625063220,"counter":317,"content":"<p>The Minister of State mentioned that vaccines are discussed at all European Council meetings, including this one.

However, I absolutely assure the Deputy and this House that there was no lateness.  In fact, no member state was late in submitting an application for the recovery fund.  Deputy Mattie McGrath is also implying that only a certain amount of money was applied for.  That is not the case.  The money is allocated on a proportionate basis according to each country&rsquo;s national wealth.  That is the reality of it.  Deputy McGrath has mentioned a figure of &euro;900 million.  It is a bit more than that but that fails to consider the Brexit adjustment reserve of more than &euro;1 billion.  It was all part of the package at the European Council last meeting last July when this budget was agreed.<\/p> <p> The funding that Ireland will receive is effectively double the figure to which Deputy Mattie McGrath refers.  What is forgotten in this debate is the fact that money spent in France, Germany or Spain also benefits Ireland.  Along with Luxembourg, Ireland benefits the most from the European Single Market.  The pharmaceutical, construction and manufacturing companies in places like Clonmel that rely on trade with the European Union are looking forward to Ireland spending its money but also to all other European countries spending their money because they will benefit from that.  The Single Market benefits us disproportionately and directly creates jobs in Tipperary South, Meath East and Waterford and all other constituencies.  We are doing very well out of this and are glad that it is happening.  We did not pull the ladder up.  We did not join the so-called frugal four in arguing that we should not give this money because we felt it was right that other European countries should be able to come up to the economic level of the rest of us but also, selfishly, because we benefit when they do well because we are such a strong exporting economy.  We benefit so much disproportionately from the Single Market and when the European economy does well, we do well too.<\/p> <p> On the spending of that money, I do not think our taxpayers should be providing funding for countries that do not uphold the rule of law, basic human rights and human decency.  I very much look forward to the conditionality regulation on the rule of law coming into operation once the European Court of Justice decision goes through, as I hope it will, and to that regulation being enforced.  The declaration we signed last week calls for that to happen and calls for a strong action to be taken.  We cannot be spending money in places where the rule of law is not upheld.  I reiterate that when we spend money in the European Single Market, when we stimulate that economy, Ireland benefits more than almost any other member of the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000041#PP01600","speaker":"1503","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625063820,"counter":324,"content":"<p>What about the passports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000042#QQ00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1625063820,"counter":325,"content":"<p>Sorry, I will happily answer the question on vaccine passports.

Some member states have yet to submit their plans.  The indicative timeline was the end of April and our application was submitted, with the agreement of the Commission, in May.  There was some media speculation at the time about the discussions that were ongoing with the Commission and about what the Government was working on.  I reject the comments from Deputies Mattie McGrath and Nolan, which were outrageous.  They used terms like \"betrayal\" and \"traitors\", which is terrible language to use in the D&aacute;il.  Everyone in this D&aacute;il is working to one end, which is the welfare of the people of Ireland.  Talking about betrayal and throwing the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill into the bin is just wrong.  It is disturbing and reflects very badly on the Deputies.  It does no service to their constituents who will benefit hugely from the just transition fund, for example, and the focus on this at European level.  We must work even harder on that to make sure it happens and I am confident that it will.<\/p>  <p>  On the specific questions posed by Deputy Harkin, I will revert to her directly once I have spoken to the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputies Michael McGrath and McConalogue.

This follows a formal request by the UK Government to the EU.  There were some other announcements today, one of which is on the very important issue of green insurance cards for drivers from outside the EU which now, unfortunately, includes those in Northern Ireland and Britain.  The requirement for UK drivers to have such cards has now been removed by the European Commission which is very welcome.  This will have a hugely positive impact on those travelling from Northern Ireland into the Republic.  There were other announcements about guide dogs.<\/p><p>The EU has shown tremendous flexibility today and a willingness to stretch as far as possible within the confines of existing legislation.  The member states have also worked very proactively and I have had lots of discussions with them, as has the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  The EU has shown today its commitment to making the protocol work for the people of Northern Ireland and its respect for both traditions there.  The Northern Ireland protocol is a two-way street.  It is the responsibility of the EU and the UK Government to ensure it is jointly owned and operated.  It shows clearly that co-operation and a bilateral approach to the protocol can lead to concrete and long term solutions.  Implementation of the protocol should be two-sided from now on.<\/p><p>I would like to commend the business communities in the Republic as well as in the North for their robust response to the challenges posed by Brexit.  The Government continues to support businesses to face the challenges that lie ahead through grants and training and information is available on the Government website in that regard at <i>www.gov.ie\/Brexit<\/i>.<\/p><p>I thank Deputies for their statements and questions and will report on some of the issues that the Taoiseach mentioned.<\/p> <p> The issue of migration was mentioned.  This is a complicated discussion, which is much broader than the discussion of the issue we have here.  We have to support our EU colleagues who have to deal with migration in much tougher circumstances than we do.<\/p> <p> On cybersecurity, leaders condemned the recent malicious activities against Ireland and Poland and some information was shared on that.<\/p> <p> On Turkey, the European Council resumed discussions on EU-Turkey relations.  Leaders expressed their readiness to engage with Turkey in a phased, proportionate and reversible manner to enhance co-operation in a number of areas of common interest, subject to the conditionality set out in March and in previous Council conclusions.  EU leaders welcomed the de-escalation in the eastern Mediterranean and stressed that it should be sustained.  They also took note of the initiation of minor technical work on a mandate for the modernisation of the EU-Turkey customs union and for preparatory work on high-level dialogues with Turkey on pressing interests of mutual concern.  EU leaders expressed their continuing concern about the rule of law and fundamental rights in Turkey, particularly the targeting of political parties, human rights defenders and the media.<\/p> <p> On financial assistance to refugees, which was mentioned by a number of colleagues, the Council called on the Commission to put forward, without delay, formal proposals for the continuation of financing for Syrian refugees and host communities in Turkey.  The Commission produced an outlined proposal on the eve of the European Council meeting, which is being assessed.<\/p> <p> On the Cyprus issue, leaders reiterated their commitment to a settlement on the basis of a bicommunal and bizonal federation with political equality, and expressed regret that the informal meeting in Geneva in April did not pave the way for the resumption of formal negotiations.<\/p> <p> Ireland is in favour of developing a more stable and constructive EU-Turkey relationship but this depends on Turkey's actions.  We welcome the fact that Turkey has largely maintained the de-escalation in its neighbourhood, although we continue to regret its stance on the issue of Cyprus.  We are in favour of continuous support of the 4 million refugees and host communities in Turkey.  On wider EU-Turkey relations, particularly the customs union, a positive track is possible but substantial steps forward are required, not only in de-escalation in the neighbourhood but also in improvements in human rights and the rule of law in Turkey. <\/p> <p> EU leaders confirmed their commitment to the stabilisation process in Libya under the auspices of the UN.  Elections should take place and their results should be accepted.<\/p> <p> On the Sahel, President Macron updated leaders on France's recent engagement there.  Ireland strongly condemns the recent developments in Mali, which are of grave concern.  It is vital that the EU continues to support the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, engagement with the transitional authorities in Mali to monitor compliance.  Ireland is strongly engaged in Mali.  In addition to the 14 members of the Defence Forces serving in the UN multidimensional integrated stabilisation mission in Mali, some 20 Defence Forces personnel are deployed to the EU training mission in Mali.  We also support other engagements.<\/p> <p> The EU Council also discussed the issue of Ethiopia.  We will work to maintain attention on that in the UN Security Council.<\/p> <p> I thank Deputies for their questions and I assure them that the Taoiseach will continue to report on the European Council.

In line with public health guidance, Government policy is to have a gradual reopening of the hospitality sector, beginning with outdoor hospitality.  Unfortunately, as Deputies will be aware, due to the significant risk that the incidence of the Delta variant of Covid-19, the Government decided yesterday that the next phase of reopening will be based on a cautious approach with an emphasis on lower-risk activities.  It nonetheless underlines the importance of ensuring this emergency legislation brings clarity for those pubs, bars and clubs that are in a position to provide an outdoor seating area to their customers and members.<\/p>  <p>  Many of our bars and restaurants have now reopened, serving outdoors, and this is giving people a welcome opportunity to safely meet friends and family again.  We want to preserve that and support those business in what has been an unprecedented period of challenge.<\/p>  <p>  We are here today because the distinction being drawn between the liquor licence and the licence or approval or both by the local authorities for outdoor seating areas is causing a concern about legal uncertainty and enforcement.  Confidence in the law and certainty is being sought by businesses, local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has clarity on its powers for public order purposes and that licensed premises owners understand their obligations to maintain order in public areas where they are selling alcohol.  I want to ensure there is no uncertainty for all involved and this time-bound Bill seeks to achieve this objective.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, it was agreed by Government to expedite an urgent provision on matters dealing with an increase in the number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  This was originally to be accommodated in the forthcoming courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill but was included in this Bill due to its speedier progression.  It is an urgent matter because of the pressures on the courts due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Despite measures taken by the Courts Service to meet the demands placed on it during the Covid-19 pandemic, including facilitating the increased use of remote hearings, the courts and Judiciary continue to face unprecedented challenges in respect of available resources, particularly in the High Court.  The existing backlog and waiting times for hearings have increased since the beginning of the pandemic and it is anticipated that there will be significant demand for access to the courts once public health restrictions are lifted.  Furthermore, the difficulties facing the court have been further exacerbated by the appointment of a number of judges to various State bodies and tribunals of investigation.  The President of the High Court flagged with the Government her concerns over the pressure on the courts.  It should be noted that the work of the independent judicial planning working group is under way.  The group is considering the number and type of judges to ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the House for facilitating this urgent Bill.  I will outline the main provisions of it.  Section 1 sets out the definitions, and the key definition is that of \"outdoor seating area\" of a licensed premises.  Part (a) of that definition seeks to ensure that where a licensed premises is operating an outdoor seating area, such areas are lawfully permitted by the local authorities.  Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is the authorisation most commonly relied on.  Part (b) of the definition provides for an outdoor seating areas on private land abutting a licensed premises with a number of further conditions, including ownership or other entitlement to use the land and that it is not already the subject of a licence.  The number of seated patrons, that is, customers or members, who can be accommodated in the area must not exceed the number of patrons who may be accommodated in the licensed premises and the area should contain sufficient seating to accommodate this number of patrons.  In addition, this cannot contain any bar area across which intoxicating liquor can be served to the public.  The sale or supply of intoxicating liquor by the licensee in this outdoor seating area should not be the primary purpose of the business.<\/p>  <p>  For the purposes of this legislation, section 2 facilitates the necessary linkage between the liquor licence and the permission to operate an outdoor seating area.  It proposes that for the period during which this section remains in operation, such areas will be deemed to be part of the licensed premises.  <\/p>  <p>  Section 2(1)(a) provides clarity that no new arrangements can be interpreted as now being in place.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2(1)(b) is an important provision to ensure the regulation of the licensed trade in the context of the annual renewal of licences.  It outlines that failure to operate an outdoor area in accordance with the Acts shall be grounds for objection to the renewal of the licence or a certificate of registration for clubs.  This shall apply irrespective of whether at the time of renewal the licensee has ceased to operate the outdoor seating area.<\/p> <p>Section 2(3) sets out that notwithstanding the type of licence held, the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in an outdoor seating area shall not be lawful where the intoxicating liquor is sold or supplied for consumption off the premises or outdoor seating area.<\/p> <p> Section 2(4) seeks to bring clarity to the issue of operating hours and to ensure the use of these outdoor areas is in compliance with what has been authorised.  This will allow the relevant local authorities to ensure the conditions of their permits are adhered to, where applicable.<\/p> <p> Section 2(5) is an important clarifying provision to the effect that the temporary licensing of an outdoor seating area under this legislation shall not be taken to absolve the licensee from appropriate authorisation under planning legislation.  This provision also confirms that these temporary premises do not allow for any activity in an outdoor seating area which is otherwise unlawful.<\/p> <p> Section 3 provides the instances where a specified person on a licensed premises must comply with the direction of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This power of direction operates in a similar manner to the powers provided under the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020.  It also allows that where a member suspects with reasonable cause that a person is not complying with the licensing legislation, this legislation or the authorisation insofar as they relate to an outdoor seated area, the member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can direct the specified person to take the steps considered necessary to ensure compliance.  A specified person, that is, a licensee, occupier, manager or any other person in charge of the premises at the time who fails to comply shall be guilty of an offence.  The offences set out in this provision are liable on summary conviction to a class C fine, imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both.<\/p> <p> Section 4 is the application of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 to an outdoor seating area in respect of relevant enactment.  Section 5 is the extension of the application of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 to an outdoor seating area.  With regard to sections 4 and 5, it is useful to understand that section 5 provides that the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 shall apply to an outdoor seating area as it applies to a relevant premises.  This means that the powers of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the 2020 Act to ensure compliance with the relevant Covid health regulations will apply with regard to an outdoor seating area.  These powers will cease to apply when the Act of 2020 ceases to operate.<\/p> <p> Section 4 provides that the powers of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 to enforce the enactments specified in that Act will apply to the enforcement of the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, the Registration of Clubs Acts, the Bill, authorisations and directions made by a member under section 3(1) as they apply to an outdoor area.  This facilitates garda&iacute; in ensuring compliance with those Acts and directions made under section 3(1) by availing of, among other things, the process outlined in the 2020 Act on temporary closure order and appeals systems.  Section 4(2) expressly states that the enforcement powers under the 2020 Act will continue to apply in respect of the enactments referred to and directions under section 3(1), notwithstanding that the Act of 2020 ceases to be in operation to ensure that there is no uncertainty on these Garda powers in the operation of this Act.<\/p> <p> Section 6 provides that an outdoor seating area on private land, as identified in this Act, is a public place for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.  Section 7 provides that the Minister may, by regulation, restrict the time period during which a licensee is permitted to sell or supply intoxicating liquor in an outdoor seating area.  Any regulation made under this section shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Section 8 involves the amendment of section 9 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 to provide for an increase in the number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  It provides for the maximum number of ordinary judges of the High Court to be increased by five, from 37 to 42.  It also provides that the Government may, by order, allow for an additional judge of the High Court over the maximum number permitted.  The Minister for Justice shall consult with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before requesting Government to make an order.<\/p> <p> Section 9 comprises the Short Title, collective citation and commencement.  This is a technical section but I want to highlight the explicit sunset clause that it shall remain in operation until 30 November.  The period of operation may be extended for such further period or periods, each not exceeding six months, as is specified in a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p> Deputies will fully appreciate the urgency of us ensuring this legislation is enacted to give reassurance to businesses and clarity for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is a time-bound Bill that is both proportionate and suitably extends the regulatory and enforcement powers.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing from Deputies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000044#XX00200","speaker":"1450","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625065320,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I welcome the legislation.  We were all surprised a few weeks ago when it became clear that much of the work that was done by people around the country who set up beer gardens and outdoor drinking areas for which, in many cases, they received grants from the State was actually done in the absence of proper authority from the point of view that the terms of their licences did not cover it.  Of course, when we spoke to people who would know this, particularly solicitors, and indeed, many vintners, they were always suspicious and asked if they were really doing the right thing.  Yet, we find that the Government proposed that this was the thing to do for months without checking and making sure that it had the legislation in place.  It is late in coming but it is welcome.  That is the point I wish to make in that regard.<\/p>  <p>  One of the big problems we have relates to the fact that the Bill is before the House on the day after the mess we ended up in regarding yesterday's announcement, which was not an announcement all, as to what was going to happen with indoor activity in hostelries.  It is clear that the big issue is not what the Government is doing, it is that the Government is not communicating with people.  This is a lesson that the Minister, the T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach and everyone involved, including the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, need to get their heads around.  There needs to be clarity in order that people understand why decisions are made and what is happening.  People are very intelligent.  They can ascertain what is happening and why a decision is made in a particular way.  Instead of that, however, the Government leads them up to the very last minute and then when they are at the top of the hill, ready to go, it says it is sorry and that it has changed its mind.  It tells people it cannot proceed because of A, B and C, without at least doing the work beforehand to ensure that people understand why.  That is really why there is so much anger about all of this.<\/p>  <p>  As I said, it is welcome that this legislation is being put in place to make sure that people will not be breaking the law when they are trying to make a living, as many people across the country are doing, particularly in the good weather we have now.  The sunset clause in the Bill is welcome, although I expect that by the time we get to 30 November, very few people will want to drink, eat or do anything else outside because it will be quite cold by then.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to mention the issue addressed by amendment No. 1, which I will move on Committee Stage.  This is a minor amendment in respect of the last line in section 3, which states that a \"specified person\" may be \"any ... person for the time being in charge of the premises.\"  That is very loose.  It could well happen to be a very junior member of staff or somebody who happens to be working for a couple of hours while the person in charge or the manager is away.  To hold that person legally responsible for everything that happens on the premises at that time is difficult.  I suggest the Minister needs to revisit this.  The purpose of our amendment is to remove that from the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The core problem when it comes to why we are here is really Covid-19.  The pandemic has caused major problems for vast numbers of people and has really put us in a terrible place.  As we try to move out of it, however, and as more people are being vaccinated, which is welcome, we all talk about the race between the vaccine and variant.  The truth is that people need to understand why we are making these decisions.  One of the problems we have is that decisions are made without people being given the opportunity to try to understand.  The Government needs to start to get that right.   We need to start to communicate with people.  We need to start to set out in clear terms how and why certain decisions were arrived at and how and why we can change them, what levels we need to be at from both the point of view of the vaccine, the numbers we have in hospital and when we want to move on from the different levels.  That has never been done.  People are in the dark about that and feel very annoyed with what has happened in the past couple of days.<\/p>  <p>  I have been contacted, as, I am sure, has every other Deputy in this House, by numerous people who are involved in the hostelries, pubs, bars and restaurants and by members of the general public who are annoyed and frustrated.<\/p> <p>They cannot understand why we are different from everywhere else in Europe.  There must be some clarity in this regard.  It is one of the points the Minister needs to take from this debate and from what has been a very bad week for the Government.  She needs to step up to the mark in communicating clearly with people.  If she can do that, she will find she at least enjoys some respect from people regarding the decisions being made.  The Government certainly is not enjoying that respect at the moment.  This is a pity as we all need to work together to get ourselves over the problems we face with the Covid-19 issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000045#YY00200","speaker":"1607","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625065920,"counter":339,"content":"<p>The intent of this Bill, which thankfully is time-limited, is welcome, not just for addressing a legal lacuna that was pointed out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but in giving certainty to the hospitality sector.  Certainly, over the past few weeks, there has been much confusion, particularly in Killarney, as to what was contained in the town by-laws, which included a 100 m rule, as against the new regulations.  Unfortunately, certainty has been in precious short supply and many of the other farcical decisions made by the Government have caused a great deal of damage, division and misunderstanding.<\/p>  <p>  It was bad enough when it became clear that the unvaccinated would be asked to work serving the vaccinated, as many hospitality and retail workers will not be offered the vaccine in time.  Some of these young people, having worked in a restaurant all night, will not be able to join their vaccinated colleagues for a drink at the end of the night.  Now it seems, under section 3(10)(d) of this Bill, that a young person who is covering a lunch break for an hour or two and who fails to produce the authorisation demanded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, could be arrested without warrant and possibly could face up to six months in jail.  That is something workers will have to take into consideration with their employer.  For nearly 18 months, young people have not been able to attend college, socialise, play outdoor sport or attend a match.  In some cases, when they tried to socialise outdoors, they were met with members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's public order unit.  After all of this, the message to them is that if they do not have the vaccine, they cannot socialise indoors but they must work indoors unvaccinated.  Given that young people are more likely to occupy less senior roles and do low-paid work in pubs, and are less likely to own or manage those pubs, they are at risk of arrest, as defined in the Bill.  While I support the vaccination programme, we are not going to get to sufficient immunity cover and the uptake we need through the creation of a two-tier categorisation of persons.  However, given the record of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael in this regard, perhaps we should not be surprised.<\/p>  <p>  We agreed to the Bill being waived through pre-legislative scrutiny but, once again, the Government is being caught flat-footed by very foreseeable developments, this time in regard to the fears around the Delta variant.  The need for this legislation has a solid legal basis but, as we have heard from expert witnesses at the justice committee over the past year, the Government has often blurred the lines, whether deliberately or accidentally, between what are legal obligations and what is health advice.  A Private Members' motion my colleagues and I moved would have gone some way towards addressing this by requiring the Government to bring regulations under the relevant legislation before the House for scrutiny prior to their being enacted.  The problem goes beyond the confines of parliamentary scrutiny.  We have had answers given during press conferences not appearing in Government advice, omissions from Government advice and poor promotion of what restrictions are currently in effect or the rationale for them.<\/p>  <p>  All of this continues to be a problem.  We saw that today with the announcement regarding the numbers to be allowed to attend matches.  This provision has been brought forward from midnight on Sunday to Saturday morning and should, in my view, be brought forward further to facilitate League of Ireland games, which take place on Friday nights, having an expanded number of fans in attendance.  Surely the Government has some idea about the spread of the virus from what has been going on at matches around Europe over the past six months?  We have been calling for changes in this regard, given that the matches take place outdoors.  The UK has seen 50% capacity at games.  In Denmark, 11,000 people have been allowed to attend matches.  Why is NPHET not releasing the data on outdoor sports fixtures if it needs to justify the small numbers being allowed to attend matches in this State?<\/p>  <p>  There are other aspects of the Bill that are concerning.  The expansion of the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, for instance, could have been fleshed out a little more.  Overall, however, the intent of the Bill is good and it will help to address the legal lacuna identified by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will deal with that at a later stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000046#ZZ00200","speaker":"1488"},{"type":"speech","time":1625065920,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I said on 21 June that a plain reading of the licensing laws would indicate that serving alcohol in the new temporary areas on streets and public spaces that have been set up for pubs is not permitted, despite local authorities granting permission for it.  I also said that both the Garda and publicans and restaurateurs need certainty in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, said that same day, in essence, that she had talked to the Garda Commissioner and that discretion would be applied.  For weeks, the Government talked about an outdoor summer, with outdoor dining a key strategy of facilitating a summer in Ireland in Covid times.  Dining outdoors was to be the hallmark of the summer but the Government did not bother to ensure its clear national strategy was lawful.  The State invested &euro;17 million to provide for temporary spaces and to make this policy a reality.  Local authorities set about designating areas and providing grants for outdoor furniture, canopies etc. for restaurants and pubs.  It did not take long for the Minister's strategy to change from one of saying the Garda would look the other way to  one of stating we should fix this legal difficulty that needs to be properly addressed.  I welcome the presentation of this Bill, although it should have been envisaged and presented well before now.<\/p>  <p>  The Government decision to allow only those who are fully vaccinated to partake of indoor dining will significantly undermine public confidence in the overall health measures that are still required to keep people safe, probably more so than ever in the context of the Delta variant.  We must explain what is being done and bring people with us.  That surely is the message of the past 18 months.  With its notion of separate categories of vaccinated and unvaccinated, the Government is offloading responsibility to restaurateurs and publicans to separate customers, potentially dividing families or groups of friends.  The requirement for certification will cause confusion and create a burden and angst for restaurateurs and publicans, who have already been crucified for the past 18 months.  All the while, these same sectors will depend on unvaccinated younger staff to serve customers.  If the Government wanted to create a point of conflict, it has done so here.  In simple logic, the notion of a young person who is unvaccinated being expected to work for six or seven hours on five or six days of the week in a pub but not being allowed to go into the same pub on his or her day off for fear of being contaminated, after spending the whole week in it, makes no sense.  We must anchor our strategy in sense and bring people with us.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the anomaly whereby in-house dining for guests of hotels has been available, lawfully and properly, since early June.  In effect, the message is that if people pay for an overnight stay in a hotel, then the health difficulties evaporate.  That cannot be the basis of a sound health strategy.  I know these are difficult decisions for the Government.  No one is suggesting anything else.  However, the public wants common sense and clear explanations based on medical advice.  At the same time, such advice is not dogma, as we have seen.  For example, in the six months since AstraZeneca was made available in this country, it was not initially forbidden by NIAC to be given to the over-70s, then it was only to be given to the over-60s, after which it was not to be given to the under-50s.  Now we are told it can, in fact, be given to people aged under 50.<\/p> <p>Originally, a second dose would be given after only 12 weeks.  Then it was 16 weeks, then eight weeks and now apparently it is four weeks.  Medical advice, therefore, is not dogma.  The Government will rightly say the advice changes because the circumstances change but in any other sphere of public policy that many changes would temper a government's dependence on the correctness of advice given and it would ensure such advice was very carefully evaluated in the context of all other issues, including external advices and what is happening in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p> On AstraZeneca, I should also state that three quarters of the 60- to 69-year-old age cohort have received only one dose to date.  That is a fact.  Three quarters of those in that vulnerable age group have received only one dose and are consequently only 30% protected against the Delta variant.  That is a fundamental failure of Government policy.  The US Centre for Disease Control, CDC, in data published on 24 June, set out the ratio of hospitalisation and death from Covid-19 by age.  Compared to the 18- to 29-year-old cohort those aged between 65 and 74 years are six times more likely to be hospitalised and a staggering 95 times more likely to die.  That is worth reflecting upon.  Those aged between 50 and 64 years are four times more likely to be hospitalised and 35 times more likely to die of Covid in comparison to 18- to 29-year-olds.  Despite this, three quarters of people in that age cohort, who are multiple times more vulnerable to hospitalisation and death, have not been vaccinated while younger cohorts have.  Since Government policy from the outset of this has been based on age and vulnerability, that is surely a monumental failure.<\/p> <p> Returning to the specifics of the Bill, there must be a general tidy-up of the interaction of the overall legislative framework and the powers, and indeed actions, of local authorities in relation to by-laws.  I previously stated that on the plain reading of it, it was unlawful to do what the Government had intended to do, that is, to have outdoor dining and simply colonise streets, pavements and so on and say they are now licenced areas.  They patently could not be because the law did not provide for it.  It hopefully will after the enactment of this legislation.  However, we should consider the by-laws.  In some case the by-laws enacted by, for example, Dublin City Council, contradict the basic law enacted by the Oireachtas and that is not lawful.  Councils cannot enact by-laws where there is extant basic law.  As such there is a general need for a tidy-up in this area and it might be something the Minister will reflect and comment on.  I am not suggesting it can be done on an emergency basis but we must have clarity so we know what is within the purview of local government and what is within the purview of the Oireachtas.  Local authority by-laws are made under section 199 of the Local Government Act 2001 which sets out the conditionality under which those by-laws can be made.<\/p> <p> I will comment on a final issue in the few minutes I have, which incidentally is not a great way of making law either, emergency or otherwise.  I refer to the bolting-on to what one might say is a non-controversial issue of a separate legislative measure.  This is the second time it has happened in the justice area that we have an agreement to take an emergency measure to deal with a specific bespoke problem we all agree must be dealt with speedily and now bolted on is another matter, in this case an increase in the number of High Court judges by five or perhaps six.  That is not something that should be bolted on to an emergency measure.  Let us deal with that in the ordinary way.  If it takes another couple of months then so bet it but let us have the rationale for that spelled out and let us have a debate about that.  We are making law and it cannot simply be a matter of saying we have a fast vehicle now and the Houses of the Oireachtas have said this is an emergency measure so let us throw in something additional to it, however meritorious the particular issue.  I obviously will not oppose it but if there are other measures to come through by agreement without pre-legislative scrutiny on an emergency basis let it be for the topics that are agreed and not for additional ones.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000046#ZZ00300","speaker":"1620","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625066520,"counter":342,"content":"<p>As the Minister might remember, I rang her when this issue became a very hot issue in Galway.  We had a good conversation about it and I really appreciate the fact that she came back to me very promptly.  I was of the view from the beginning that looking for discretion is a bad policy in law and that the best way to sort out this is the way the Minister is doing it, by bringing in the legislation and having no uncertainty about what is going to happen.  I say that on two grounds, the first being that I knew where the issue had stemmed from and knew the circumstances various people were trying to deal with, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and knew the competing demands from different sections of society.  The other reason is that it is untidy.  I believe in discretion in some circumstances but I do not believe in a discretion where one person applies it one way and another applies it another way.  I would like to think when people use discretion most reasonable people would have applied it the same way in the same circumstance.  I welcome this prompt action by the Government to deal with this issue and bringing certainty to it.<\/p>  <p>  I got this Bill only in the afternoon and was busy all day at committees.  I take it on a very quick reading of it that basically, the area immediately abutting a licenced premises de facto becomes part of that premises and therefore alcohol can be served there in the normal way, subject to keeping the normal order a person would keep within his or her licenced premises.  My understanding is that in Galway there is a general prohibition in by-laws on drinking in the street.  I presume without changing the by-laws that these particular areas are now covered by the primary legislation which would trump any by-law made by the local authority.  However, that issue needs to be clarified so we are absolutely clear.  I have understood from the very beginning that statute law always trumps any by-law.  That clarity may be supplied by the Minister in her reply.  She might state that a council cannot now make a by-law making it illegal to drink when a person is served on what seems to me, based on a very quick perusal of this Bill, to have become de facto part of the licenced premises.<\/p>  <p>  Any of us who have been in Government, including the previous speaker, will have had the experience where, in the morass of legislation in this field - there is a huge amount of it - some detail gets overlooked.  These things happen, and even the most expert people can often find differences in the law and there can be arguments about interpretation and so on.  It is difficult to foresee every problem but what is much more inexcusable is to not deal with a problem once it has arisen.  I say fair play to the Minister, this issue has been dealt with expeditiously, will bring certainty to this issue and allow us to close this chapter of the book.  It is a very minor ripple that has been dealt with expeditiously and we should not get overexcited about it because it is now solved, or will be once the Minister gets the Bill through the Houses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000047#AAA00200","speaker":"1575"},{"type":"speech","time":1625066520,"counter":343,"content":"<p>The Bill before the House is legislation that will place parameters on outdoor dining and drinking.

The idea that indoor hospitality services will only open to those who have been vaccinated will create a two-tier society.  As matters stand, a 20-year-old can eat and drink in an outdoor setting but cannot do so in an indoor setting.  It is like a perverse Lanigan's Ball - she stepped out but she cannot step in again.  The same 20-year-old can work in an indoor setting, serving food and drink, but God forbid she might want to socialise in the same indoor setting outside working hours.  Our young people have been to the forefront in this pandemic and although I can give them a round of applause in this Chamber, I cannot buy them a round of drinks in their local pub.  This is just bonkers.  Members of the public have played their part in suppressing this virus but the Government must repay this hard work with common sense and pragmatic solutions.

We did not object to the waiving of pre-legislative scrutiny for that reason but I agree with Deputy Howlin on the tacking on of other matters.  It is not the right way to proceed and it is disingenuous to presume we would even know this would happen.<\/p>  <p>  The urgency needed to pass this Bill is indicative of the absolute lack of preparation for an outdoor summer.  It should not have taken businesses and garda&iacute; raising the matter for the problem to become obvious.  The licences are granted based on the floor space of a premises and in some places around the country, there are by-laws.  I was involved in the making of by-laws in one of the local authorities of which I was a member for some years.  Making such by-laws is about trying to achieve a particular outcome in public parks, etc.  I do not understand why there would have been confusion about that as such by-laws are not in operation everywhere.  I am not sure why it was not considered that the issue is with liquor or licensing laws when such a large investment was being made from the public purse, welcome as that was.<\/p>  <p>  There was confusion among those who were trying to manage the open spaces and there was also understandable confusion caused for garda&iacute; as to what discretion could be used.  It can cause all sorts of problems when the law is not clear and garda&iacute; are expected to enforce the law.  This legislation has been introduced to cover a particular period, which is understandable, but until everybody is vaccinated, nobody is safe.  We know variants can appear and I suspect this is something that could become an established pattern.  We should consider this for the foreseeable future at least, which may stretch to the next few years.<\/p>  <p>  As long as outdoor seating is done safely, it does not obstruct footpaths but consideration must be given to people with disabilities and those pushing prams.  I see no reason the improvements in our cities and towns might not have some degree of permanence about them.  I have gone to places such as Germany in the winter where there is much dining al fresco despite the fact that the climate is not particularly warm then.  We should think this out a little bit.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2(3) appears to ban the sale of takeaway alcohol in outdoor seating areas.  It states, \"in respect of a licensed premises, the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in an outdoor seating area shall not be lawful where the intoxicating liquor is sold or supplied for consumption off the premises or outdoor seating area.\"  What is the thinking behind this?  Would people be able to buy drink around the corner in a supermarket, for example?  Some of the pubs, for example, have been providing takeaway drinks for months without issue.  Do people now have to go inside or is that banned as well?<\/p>  <p>  There was advice from NPHET yesterday on indoor drinking.  The Government has made a very big mistake here.  What is proposed is impossible on a practical level.   I will not even call it a plan because the Government does not really have a plan.  This is creating an unacceptable division and the plan is unethical.  I wonder if it is lawful.  That kind of division in society is completely unwarranted.  We were all in this together 15 months ago and now, a considerable period down this road and after learning much, we are dividing society in a very dramatic way.  The Taoiseach had previously ruled out the use of domestic vaccine passports on civil liberty grounds but the idea is now meant to be introduced.  How prescriptive was the advice from NPHET?  I have been reluctant to criticise NPHET because it has given much good and well-thought-out advice.  This seems to be so prescriptive, however, that it strays into the political sphere in a very dramatic way.  It is very problematic.<\/p>  <p>  On the proposed addition of a number of judges to the High Court, I accept there is likely to be a backlog of cases, which is not desirable.  Is it likely this number will be required into the future?  Do we know that?  The Minister indicated in her speech that it could be noted the work of the independent judicial planning working group is under way and the group is considering the number and type of judges that would ensure the efficient administration of justice over the next five years.  Is this likely to be a temporary addition?  These are permanent posts but it would have been very useful to have had a discussion in advance of legislation and an outline of what will happen.  It is not the way this should be done.<\/p>  <p>  If there is a possibility of bringing forward the administration of vaccines, it should be done.  The situation with vaccines throughout the country is quite.  For example, a person aged 40 in my area is unlikely to have been vaccinated yet but people in their late 30s who live in other parts of the country have been vaccinated.  There is much frustration about that and people do not know when they will be called.  It may well be that there are insufficient vaccination centres or perhaps times must be extended to take account of discrepancies.<\/p>  <p>  I spoke to a young woman with cystic fibrosis earlier today and she was really unhappy that the advice is not to mix the vaccines.  Mixing vaccines would give her the best possible outcome.  Her first dose was of the AstraZeneca vaccine and there was a good report last week, which was not really publicised in this jurisdiction, on the mixing of vaccines.  We must find out what will happen in that regard.<\/p> <p>It may be that we are exposing people who are more vulnerable to a double dose of a vaccine that is perhaps less valuable, even if it is only marginally less valuable.  All the vaccines are very good and I am not trying to do it down but it seriously needs to be looked at urgently.<\/p> <p> The decision yesterday also needs to be revisited and looked at urgently.  There is a meeting today with some of the industry representatives, but this is not just an industry issue.  This is a societal issue.  We are in this together and we should come out of it together.  We should not create that kind of discrimination.  It is very difficult to even figure out how it would work.  Families do not come in one size, they are mixed in ages.  Many people will go on staycations here.  The people in the caravan parks will be treated differently to those who can afford a hotel.  The complications of this are widespread but the lack of social solidarity is a significant issue and the Government needs to go back urgently to look at this again.  This is not acceptable on any level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000048#BBB00200","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625067720,"counter":347,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on bringing forward the Bill.  Many individuals thought that by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising its discretion, we could overcome the problems that have been outlined in this legislation.  It is preferable, however, to have certainty in the issue.  When a publican or a restaurant is granted a licence to sell alcohol, the permission they are granted is to sell alcohol on their premises.  This means that if a pub at the top of Harcourt Street has a licence to sell alcohol there, it does not mean that an individual can buy alcohol there and drink it at the bottom of Harcourt Street.  What prohibits this are the by-laws in place in Dublin city that prohibit the drinking of alcohol in public places.  The Bill is, therefore highly appropriate.  I commend the Minister on bringing certainty to the issue by enacting this legislation here today.<\/p>  <p>  Great measures have been taken by local authorities around the country to ensure hospitality businesses can be conducted outside and the effect of the legislation will be to enable this business to be done legally and lawfully.  It means that if a person has a licence to sell alcohol from a public house, then individuals can drink outside that public house on tables and chairs provided that have been licensed by the local authority.<\/p>  <p>  It is now more than three weeks since outdoor hospitality commenced.  It has gone extremely well.  It has been extremely effective in Dublin.  The industry, the local authorities and the Government have replaced disorganised socialising with organised socialising.  They need to be commended on the work they have done.  One can see it any time when walking through the city.  An awful lot of the antisocial behaviour we saw in the city prior to the reopening of hospitality out of doors is now being reduced significantly.<\/p>  <p>  We also need to recognise that the hospitality industry needs to have our support.  It is getting support here by the enactment of this legislation.  We have not had an opportunity to discuss and debate the issues that arose yesterday in respect of the hospitality industry but I would like to see that process expedited.  It is important for the hospitality sector that it is not placed with all of the responsibility for any risk that arises with regard to the pandemic into the future.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to deal with a specific issue raised with me repeatedly by constituents who have sent me emails yesterday and today, which concerns the cancellation or postponement of confirmations and communions.  They had already been postponed on a number of occasions.  I was speaking with one grandmother today who told me her granddaughter had to have clothes bought again for her since she had grown out of the clothes that had been bought for the previous planned communion.  I would ask that the Government could look at this.  There must be creative ways by which this matter can be resolved in order that we can facilitate such communions and confirmations.  We are all aware of what we are told is the risk in respect of statistics and modelling by NPHET but it is the responsibility of the Government to come up with solutions for issues such as this.  These are very important social development issues for people in our society and we must be seen to try to facilitate them<\/p>  <p>  I commend the Minister on the Bill.  It will bring great clarity to the area of the sale of licensed alcohol in the near future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000049#CCC00200","speaker":"1553"},{"type":"speech","time":1625067720,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister on bringing forward this legislation.  I also commend everybody involved in putting in place over recent weeks the infrastructure that has allowed outdoor hospitality and outdoor dining to become a reality.  Any of us who have walked through the streets of Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Cork or any city, town or village, will have seen the pop-up infrastructure in place and people dining outdoors in a controlled environment, which is always better than uncontrolled environments.  It is a very welcome addition and weather permitting, I would hope to see it become a permanent feature during the summer months over the next years.  It brings a vibrancy to towns, villages and city centres that adds real value.  This is something to be positive about.<\/p>  <p>  I am concerned about the lack of certainty in respect of the wider reopenings for indoor hospitality.  I fully accept that this is tough for everybody.  I get it that the Government must make tough decisions.  We in Opposition are also being asked hard questions.  The people who are living the consequences of a lack of inaction are the restaurateurs, the publicans, the staff, young people and people who might become victims of what could be a very unfair solution put in place.  Every option has to be on the table.  We need the Government to now come back with a plan that provides certainty on when we can see reopenings for everybody.  Antigen testing should be on the table.  The key to all of this is the vaccine roll-out.  We need to see an updated vaccine roll-out plan delivered by the Government as quickly as possible.

There is something quite undemocratic about an approach that takes a Bill to do with licensing, outdoor drinking and so on and that includes in that Bill an increase in the number of High Court judges.  It means that it is not the focal point of the debate and discussion.  Something that is not urgent and which should be part of a proper discussion is being stuck into urgent legislation.  It is a very poor approach by the Government.<\/p>  <p>  On the thrust and the main essence of this legislation, we agree that dealing with this issue is necessary.  It is a sign of an extreme lack of preparation, not just pre-pandemic as this pandemic has been with us for more than one year, that we need legislation to deal with this to ensure there are no legal issues with people drinking in these extended outdoor areas.  This legislation is necessary but we should have done it a year ago, in advance of summer 2020, as opposed to summer 2021.  Here we are, yet again.  We agree that this is welcome, it being an outdoor summer and all of that.  There is a tendency, however, for this outdoor summer to be out of doors in privatised spaces where one must pay for an alcoholic drink, a coffee or whatever to be able to be there.  There is a real lack of focus by the Government on providing public common spaces where anybody can go without payment to a private business.  This has been encapsulated in quite an extreme way with the square at Portobello.  I was also in St. Stephen's Green one day recently and all of the bandstands are currently closed up.  These obvious and safe places for people to gather and to be outside are closed off for people.  While I am in favour of facilitating businesses having the outdoor spaces, it is a very poor approach to facilitate only businesses that provide such outdoor public spaces and that the State would not provide quality public common spaces.<\/p> <p>Such spaces include public parks.  There have been some improvements in some parks but we still have issues relating to an ongoing lack of investment in capital facilities over an extended period and in the recruitment of staff, such as park rangers.  We have issues with bins overflowing and an absence of toilets and public seating places in many of our parks.  Over a year into a pandemic, this is not what we should be facing.<\/p> <p> On the broader issue, which clearly is a focal point of this discussion, there has been a lot of nonsense spoken both inside and outside the D&aacute;il over the past 24 hours.  People have been giving the impression that we should have just ploughed on and opened indoor hospitality on 5 July and everything would have been fine.  Here, many backbench Government Deputies have been engaging in it as well as others.  They have been saying we should have just ploughed ahead.  If we check the record, we will see they are the same people who last October and November were saying it was outrageous and that we should have been opening up hospitality.  The reopening happened at the end of November and in the early part of December and it had consequences.  People can read the contribution sent by Deputy MacSharry to the Taoiseach in October, when there were 1,000 cases a day.  Eventually, the advice given and pressure exerted by those to whom I refer was heeded by the Government.  We opened up and 1,000 people died in January and a further 1,000 died in February.  There is a correlation between these two things.  The reopening of hospitality was a disastrous decision that resulted in many lives being lost.<\/p> <p> It is true that it would not be the same if we reopened on 5 July.  It would not be the same because vaccination would take the edge off it.  However, we must also recognise where we are at.  We are behind the North, England, Scotland and Wales in terms of vaccination.  The majority of people in the South have either had one dose of vaccine or have not been vaccinated.  This means they are quite vulnerable to the Delta variant.  Again, the most vulnerable have been vaccinated but not all of them have been fully inoculated as a result of the gap between doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Even if we are speaking about younger people, we are still talking about hospitalisation, long Covid and either hundreds or more than 1,000 deaths as a result of the decision to open up and let it rip.<\/p> <p> This is not an abstract discussion.  We can look north.  In the North, we can look at the date that indoor hospitality was opened and ten days later we can see sharp increases, which are continuing, in the numbers of cases and hospitalisations.  These will likely translate into increased deaths in the coming period.  To have opened up on 5 July would have been a disastrous decision.  We have no alternative but not to open up.  The consequence of opening up would not only have increased the numbers of cases, long Covid, hospitalisations and deaths, but would also likely have caused a need to go into reverse and begin to close things down, not only indoor hospitality but probably also outdoor hospitality.  This is the reality of what going down the road would have meant.  It is not a road the vast majority of people would want to go down.  People really could not stomach going into another lockdown.<\/p> <p> I want to make a point on the outsized role played by business owners and the owners of restaurants and pubs in public debate.  There is no question that they should be listened to and there is no question that they should be part of the debate.  There is no question the Government should be taking measures to ensure small pub and restaurant owners are not impacted badly by this but I want to know where are the workers' representatives?  Did the Government meet workers' representatives today?  Where are the workers in the media?  Where are the young workers who will be asked in the Government's scenario to come in and serve vaccinated and unvaccinated people and put themselves significantly at risk?  The idea of opening, in terms of unvaccinated young people being asked to serve the vaccinated, simply will not work.  It is not a workable option.<\/p> <p> There was an alternative.  Nobody else in the D&aacute;il or in politics was calling from it apart from the socialist left.  More than one month ago, People Before Profit warned that we were in a race between the variant and the vaccine.  Not only did we give a warning, we provided an alternative and a way of avoiding the situation and getting ahead in the race, which would have been to move to mandatory hotel quarantine for travellers from England, Scotland and Wales a month ago.  If we had done this we could have protected our reopening and we possibly could have gone ahead with 5 July.  However, the Government did not go down that road.  In effect, it accepted it was inevitable that the Delta variant would spread and that we could not even slow it down and give our vaccinators a chance to get on top of it.<\/p> <p> This morning, I raised the following point with the T&aacute;naiste at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is quite incredible that we are more than a year into a pandemic and that the Government's plan is to open up and compel unvaccinated young workers to go into hospitality settings and serve people while there are no legally enforceable guidelines on ventilation.  The thing we have learned about Covid over the course of the past year is how airborne it is and how important ventilation is.  The T&aacute;naiste admitted that there are no enforcement mechanisms.  We have voluntary guidelines for indoor hospitality issued by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in conjunction with the HSE.  We have a new version of the work safely protocol.  We have many references to good things that should be done in terms of ventilation but they have no legal basis.  They are just a collection of voluntary public health advice.  We should have maximum CO2 levels laid down in law and monitored.  Let us provide or subsidise CO2 monitors for pubs, hotels, restaurants and all the rest, and then monitor them and state the levels have to be below a certain point and proper ventilation measures have to be put in place.  It is somewhat incomprehensible that we have reached this point and we do not have a law on ventilation, particularly when one considers how important it is in terms of workers' health and safety.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000049#CCC00400","speaker":"1628","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625068320,"counter":351,"content":"<p>It is vital for communities throughout the country that the uncertainty around the lawful sale and consumption of alcohol in outdoor seating areas is addressed and clarified so this part of our hospitality sector can restart doing as much business as the rules allow.

The Government and the Minister are behind the curve again with this Bill to legalise outdoors drinking.  I welcome that but the Government was wrong and not at the races when it advised people to drink outside when there was no law to ensure it was legal.  I submitted a parliamentary question last October asking whether the law had changed or was going to be changed in relation to outside drinking.  On our licence it states we are licensed to sell beer and tobacco to be consumed on the premises.  Nothing could be clearer than that.  Members of the Government were not aware of that until the Garda in Galway woke them up and they decided to do this.  Now we are voting to appoint judges as well.  Why could there not be a separate Bill for that?<\/p>  <p>  I welcome what many pubs have done.  They have spent a great deal  of money to provide outdoor seating and umbrellas to keep people comfortable.  I am glad what they are doing now will not be treated as illegal and they will be operating legally.  However, I see this will mean off-licences will also be allowed to sell drink for consumption in public places.  That is what is happening.  At the same time, owners of indoor hospitality businesses will have to keep looking out the window and not letting anyone in.  These are small pubs, restaurants and caf&eacute;s that have given great service over the years, some going back three, four or five generations of families.<\/p>  <p>  I do not understand where the Government was at.  Where has the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, been for the past number of weeks?  He was clearly absent and not at the wheel.  It now seems that Dr. Tony Holohan and his outfit run the country and dictate what must happen.<\/p>  <p>  Groups of people, even from Kerry, are travelling up the North of Ireland for stag parties and other occasions.  What is different about the Six Counties?  We are not going to Europe at all.  The rest of Europe and the world is open but the Twenty-six Counties will not be open.  According to George Lee, we will not be let open until after October.  The Government is asking the vintners today to provide a plan.  What good is asking them now when the decision has been made?  The Government made the decision yesterday to keep small hospitality services closed indefinitely.  That is wrong.  There is a suggestion that young people have to be vaccinated but there are no vaccines to be got.  It is very unfair.<\/p>  <p>  People who owned pubs, restaurants and caf&eacute;s for generations have their heads down today and are disappointed.  A lot of people around the country are thinking the same way.  They feel the Government is inept, not at the wheel and not in charge.  I  agree with them.  It is a disaster to do this to hard-working people who were the pillars of society and gave to charities and provided sponsorships over the years.  They have been totally let down.  The longer they are kept closed - and it looks like the Government will keep them closed for a long time - the more of them will never reopen.  It is a sad day for people in Scartaglen, Gneevegullia, Currow, all those fine places, back around Sneem and the Inny Tavern.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000051#EEE00200","speaker":"1580"},{"type":"speech","time":1625068920,"counter":355,"content":"<p>This is like playing Russian roulette.

I do not mean that literally but the Minister knows well what I am trying to say.  It has been extraordinary.  I said today when I left the Cabinet room - Deputy Howlin or Deputy Kelly may have been there - that at the first meeting we were called into when this happened, I staggered out of the room in fear because of the predictions from NPHET.  Thank God and thanks to our HSE and front-line staff, they did not materialise.  Every prediction NPHET has made has been like doomsday and has been proved utterly wrong, false and fake.  The one it came up with this week beat all others out.  It had a latitude in the middle of the scenarios of a multiple of ten.  The worst case scenario was 7,500 cases and the most optimistic scenario was 800.  There is a whole ocean in between, the distance from Mizen Head to Malin Head.  What is NPHET playing at?  It plays it safe, and takes a belt and braces approach.  It has the nobblers on the Cabinet, the Taoiseach and the Government.  That is good enough for them because they handed control over to NPHET.  The former Taoiseach, now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and the current Taoiseach handed the reins of power to an unelected cabal.  Now there is another cabal behind them, namely, the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC.  They will probably think of another one when they try to cover their tracks and give it another acronym.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is needed.  I have saluted and supported An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na all my life but they have been put in an invidious position.  The county councils were given grants.  My daughter, who is a councillor, and many others helped businesses to get grants to take away parking spaces and provide outdoor eating spaces.  The Garda was told to give a wink and a nod.  I thought those days were gone.  There was no legislation so members of the Government are fumbling, mumbling, stumbling and meandering from crisis to crisis.  They do not have a clue what they are at.  It is a shame; we are supposed to be legislators.  We are legislating this evening after the fact, trying to close the door when the horse has bolted, gone around the racecourse five times and is ready to go off the race and maybe jump a few hurdles.<\/p>  <p>  Members of the Government are jumping to whatever height NPHET tells them.  Then they are asking to go higher and raise the bar.  To make this legislation better, they throw in the middle of it a provision to increase the number of judges from 37 to 43.  We are told they are ordinary judges.  I do not know who the extraordinary judges are.  I thought that in our democracy most of them were meant to be ordinary, and of and by the people.<\/p> <p>It is scandalous that the Government would include in this legislation the appointment of extra judges in the middle of what I have called a \"plandemic\" since last April 12 months.  No doubt, they will be thoroughly vetted and have good Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael genes.  I am sure the Green Party will have a judge, too.  I mean no disrespect to any of them and I hope they do a good job but, as we know, justice is not being served well by some judges.  We saw the charade after \"golfgate\".  I wish Mr. Justice Woulfe well.  He was finally let in, but the others did not want him for so long it was as if they had said, \"We are all in this together but we do not want you.\"  Now he is sitting with them, though.  I do not know how justice was being served by the stand-off with the others.<\/p> <p> Do we have a complaints procedure now?  As of tomorrow, 1 July, can we make a complaint about a judge?  The procedure has been delayed and prevaricated about for nearly two years since the legislation was introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Shane Ross, and passed.  Will we be able to make a complaint tomorrow if we feel there has been a miscarriage of justice?  Obviously, it would have to be proved.  Will that procedure finally be open or will the Government find some other cloak and dagger way of stifling it, and then to hell with it?<\/p> <p> Justice is not being well served.  I spoke to a constituent of the Minister's last week whose son had been mown down by a criminal with several convictions, carried 200 yd on his bicycle and killed.  He was Shane in Monaghan.  The Minister knows who that is.  It will shortly be ten years since his death, but there has been no justice for his family.  There has been no justice following the Omagh bombing, which happened beside the Minister's constituency.

I welcome this legislation.  It is important and prudent that we put in place the necessary legal framework for outdoor dining.  While I appreciate the efforts that have been made by businesses in terms of outdoor dining and the rush that was put on, I always say that we must not lose the run of ourselves.  It is a fine evening in Dublin, but we must remember that we are not in Puerto del Carmen in Lanzarote, the south of Spain or somewhere like that.  Much of the time, it is too cold and wet to put out the cat.  He would nearly get drowned outside.  We must be mindful of that.  What we are all aiming for is indoor dining being allowed again.<\/p>  <p>  I represent the people of the tourism capital of Ireland and Europe.  That is, of course, County Kerry.  I have been inundated by publicans, caf&eacute; owners, restaurant owners and others from the hospitality sector who are bitterly disappointed.  They were hoping that the Government would be able to keep to the reopening date of 5 July.  They had rosters and everything else put in place.  There is so much confusion out there.  While this legislation is welcome, given that it puts in place a framework for the Garda to allow the outdoor serving of alcohol and so on to continue, it is a worrying time for these businesses.  There is confusion over whether the person who owns the restaurant or pub will have to ask a person at the door whether he or she is vaccinated.  People from the legal profession would be a long time scratching their heads over whether it was legal and constitutional to ask people private questions about their healthcare, whether they were vaccinated and whether their families, who would be dining as well, were vaccinated.  What would the story be if a child in a family who wished to eat was not vaccinated?  We have all these issues to contend with.  We have such worries and problems.  Coming from County Kerry, I am hearing this from early morning until late at night.  There are people who are worried about whether their businesses will ever open.  We are hearing people on the media saying that, in their opinion, it could be September or October.  People are going through mental anguish.  Not too long ago, I raised with the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions the issue of mental health, the problems that people have with suicide and so on.  These matters are of real concern, and it is a concern that the Government and other decision makers must take on board.  I am begging and pleading with them to give clarity and be authoritative about what they are doing.  They should try to give clear answers to the problems, difficulties and worries that people have and avoid confusion.  At the moment, things are extremely confused.<\/p>  <p>  On a personal note, I thank the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for the great efforts she has always made on issues surrounding County Kerry.  She has never let County Kerry down when I have approached her with specific issues and problems.  I am relying on people like her to continue helping us into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000052#FFF00500","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1625069520,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I commend the Minister in general on this Bill and the intention behind it.  I do not accept that we could have worked away and asked garda&iacute; to exercise their discretion, particularly when we penalise garda&iacute; when they do exercise their discretion.  We cannot ask them not to apply the law in the manner that was proposed by some.  I have no problem with the intention behind the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  There is a provision relating to the appointment of extra High Court judges.  While it does not necessarily fit well within this Bill, I do not have a problem with it.  I actually welcome it because it is important that we have a functioning and properly resourced Judiciary in our democracy.  A high-profile case was taken alleging that the right to the freedom of religion had been breached during the Covid restrictions but it was determined by the High Court Bench that there were insufficient judicial resources to hear the matter.  That is worrying.  If someone's rights can be breached and there are not sufficient judicial resources to hear the matter, we are teetering on the verge of totalitarianism and authoritarianism.  I do not believe we necessarily are, but if the appointment of extra High Court judges takes us back from that precipice, then I greatly welcome it.  Of course, there has been an inevitable large backlog in cases.  While some types of case could be heard remotely, it was difficult for other types of case to be heard.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to raise a specific matter concerning the Bill.  The Bill defines an outdoor seating area \"in relation to a licensed premises\" and gives a long list of criteria.  That is all well and good.  However, section 6 reads: \"For the avoidance of doubt, an outdoor seating area on private land is a public place for the purposes of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994.\"  I have no problem with the general scheme of the Bill or the definition in respect of a licensed premises, but section 6 goes much further.  It does not just extend the applicability of the 1994 Act to outdoor seating areas that are used in respect of a licensed premises, but to outdoor seating areas in general.  Regardless of whether it is used in respect of a licensed premises, every outdoor seating area is now a public place for the purposes of the 1994 Act.  While that might not be the Bill's intention, that is what it does.  This is draconian and worrying.  It effectively opens up the question of whether my yard at home or someone's patio becomes subject to the 1994 Act if it has a couple of seats, as mine does.  I can see that this might not be the Minister's intention, and I certainly hope it is not, but it is the effect of section 6 as drafted.  I hope that the Minister will clarify that this is not her intention and that she will commit to looking into the matter for the purposes of a possible amendment in the Seanad before it returns to the D&aacute;il.  I submitted an amendment, but I was too late because the Bill was rushed.<\/p> <p>I question the way in which legislation is rushed and guillotined.  I appreciate this is important legislation but given that only one amendment is in, from Deputy Martin Kenny, it should not have been beyond the possibilities of the House to accommodate another amendment.  Be that as it may, it was not accommodated.  I would like the Minister to look into this.<\/p> <p> I support the Bill and all that Minister seeks to achieve in it, but not the extension of the public order Act to every outdoor seating area, if that includes a patio in somebody's garden.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000052#FFF00600","speaker":"1518","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625070120,"counter":365,"content":"<p>I support the Bill, albeit most reluctantly.  I thank the Minister for acting speedily on this because there was a necessity for speed.  The situation that arose was brought to the attention of the public by the chief superintendent in Galway.  He did us all a favour by raising the idiotic situation that arose on foot of the failure to prepare and the message that we were going to have an outdoor summer.  In that regard, I heartily welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for her speed in doing so.  I do not accept that it could not have gone through pre-legislative scrutiny and I will come back to this point.<\/p>  <p>  I find it very difficult that, once again, we are including measures on other matters into this Bill.  In this case it is a provision which I agree with, namely, an increase in the number of judges but it should not be in the same legislation.  It is not a good precedent and nor is it good for our democracy to keep waiving pre-legislative scrutiny, albeit that the committee agreed with doing it.<\/p>  <p>  I will explain why, because Galway is a very good example of what happened.  We brought in by-laws on two occasions, the second set of which is still there, which prevented drinking on the streets.  We did everything correctly in Galway.  The reason those by-laws were brought in was because after a long period of consultation and significant issues arising in relation to out-of-control drinking in public areas, there was no balancing of rights in residential areas.  After a very long time we brought in the by-laws.  However, the by-laws prevent drinking in the streets.  The message from the Government was to go out and literally get drunk, that it would be an outdoor summer.  I see the Minister takes issue with that.  I take that back; it was to have an outdoor summer.  That message of an outdoor summer was extremely limited, was it not?  The message was to go out and consume, eat and drink and the Government would provide funding of &euro;18 million.  I have no difficulty supporting businesses.  I am in favour of a thriving city, but the message was one-dimensional.  There was no message of an outdoor summer in terms of canoes, sailing, windsurfing or any of the other wonderful activities we associate with summer or swimming.  That one-dimensional message created huge problems.<\/p>  <p>  That one dimensional message utterly ignored the Barcelona Declaration that we passed in Galway in 2002, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will be very familiar.  I think she was there at the time.  It guaranteed universal access to all residents to the city and enjoyment of its facilities, regardless of their age or ability.  The mantra we all used at the time was good design enables and bad design disables, to get away from labels.  That was ignored completely by management in Galway as it rushed to comply with the message from the Government to have an outdoor summer.  I am glad that we are introducing this legislation.  I am glad there is a sunset clause because I look on the taking over of public space as a restricted measure to help businesses to get over the Covid restrictions.  That we would roll it on by way of a resolution is of great concern to me.  I imagine I will be sitting in the Chair in due course when it comes before us without debate.  I have serious concerns about that.<\/p>  <p>  I return to yesterday's message that the Government now intends to allow only vaccinated people to be served indoors.  I do not have enough words inside my brain to describe my reaction to that on both a gut and emotional level.  It is divisive, disgusting and it is simply unacceptable.  We brought the people of Ireland on and they led us by their example and now we are going to divide and conquer.  It is unacceptable and sense must prevail regarding this matter.  The Minister must stop this idiocy.

They do not see a problem in sending out a message to go out, drink and consume and we will look after businesses.  They have utterly failed to learn the lesson that we want to transform the way we do things.  Due to Covid and climate change, we must have transformative action.  We cannot go back to the way we were.<\/p>  <p>  If the Minister has any influence at all, this should be a limited measure.  She should talk to local authorities, Galway City Council, in particular, remind them of their obligations under the Barcelona Declaration and their commitment to provide access to everyone.  Then she should stop this idiocy of divide and conquer.  Let us work together.  I say this as someone who supported a zero Covid approach.  I believed we could have achieved that and we should have worked from that but we did not.

This is important legislation at a sensitive time, intended to clarify the position of licenceholders who wish to sell and serve alcohol adjacent to a licensed premises in an area approved by the relevant local authority.  These premises have no remedy to amend their licence to include that area under current legislation.  To ensure maximum equity with businesses that seek to comply with the Government's guidance and regulations for outdoor activity in the Covid context, it was considered prudent to provide some clarity and assurances for licensees who rely on private property immediately adjacent to their licensed premises to provide outdoor seating areas.<\/p>  <p>  The Minster, Deputy Humphreys, outlined the main provisions of the Bill previously in this House.  It is clear this effective measure to address this matter for licensees for the period ahead is appropriate.  Together with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, I am committed to delivering the Government's commitment to modernise alcohol legislation.  The complexity of the law in this area and the challenges of this matter demonstrate the real impetus for this reform.  We look forward to producing legislation and working with the House to codify the licensing laws and to bring a more permanent solution to the situation that has arisen here.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that the creation of an offence and the application of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 pertain to these outdoor seating areas.  The overwhelming majority of licensees complied with the provisions of the enforcement powers Act and it is anticipated that the provisions in this Bill will be similarly adhered to with very few exceptions.  The Bill also provides for objections to renewals.  It outlines that failure to operate an outdoor area in accordance with the Acts shall be grounds for objection to the renewal of the licence or a certificate of registration in regard to clubs.  This shall apply irrespective of whether, at the time of renewal, the licensee has ceased to operate the outdoor seating area.  It is also noted that there is sunset clause in place until 30 November.  The House will have an opportunity to consider whether it is appropriate for this legislation to be renewed at that time.<\/p>  <p>  I will refer to some of the issues raised by Deputies in the House this evening.  Regarding yesterday's decision, which I acknowledge was a very difficult one, the Government has always stated that when we reopen sections of the economy, we want them to stay open.  We are working to ensure we can reopen indoor hospitality.  That work is currently under way on foot of NPHET advice.  A number of other issues were raised by Deputies in regard to the Bill.  Deputy McNamara referred to private lands and the outdoor seating areas.  In the Bill, \"private lands\" means land other than State land within the meaning of the State Property Act 1954.<\/p> <p>It is important to note that the permissive inclusion of outdoor seating areas on private lands for the purpose of this Bill is subject to a number of conditions.  These conditions are set out in the definition of \"outdoor seating area\".  The definition applies to land which is not already the subject of a licence.  The number of seated patrons who can be accommodated in the area must not exceed the number of patrons who may be accommodated in the licensed premises and the areas should contain sufficient seating to accommodate this number of patrons.  In addition, this cannot contain any bar area across which intoxicating liquor can be served to the public.  The sale or supply of intoxicating liquor by the licensee in this outdoor seating area should not be the primary purpose of the business.<\/p> <p> With regard to outdoor recreational spaces, the Minister, in her other remit as Minister for Rural and Community Development, has provided a significant amount of funding to local authorities under the outdoor recreation scheme for the local authorities to invest in public realm facilities and infrastructure.  It is also a commitment of the Government throughout the Covid-19 pandemic to ensure we can accommodate the public to enjoy an outdoor summer.  This will have longer term benefits for towns and villages across the country.<\/p> <p> Another issue raised which I wish to address related to the courts and the appointment of judges.  As regards the propriety of the amendment to section 9 of the Courts and Courts Officers Act 1995 being progressed in section 8 of this Bill, it was originally intended to accommodate this provision in the forthcoming courts and civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, but due to its urgency this Bill was viewed as an appropriate legislative opportunity given its urgency, which is also linked to Covid-19 matters.  Despite measures taken by the Courts Service to meet the demands placed on it during the pandemic, including facilitating increased use of remote hearings, the courts and the Judiciary continue to face unprecedented challenges in respect of available resources, particularly in the High Court.  The existing backlog and waiting times for hearings have increased since the beginning of the pandemic and it is anticipated that there will be a significant demand for access to the courts once public health restrictions have lifted.  Furthermore, the difficulties facing the court have been exacerbated by the appointment of a number of judges to various State bodies and tribunals of investigation.  Section 8 is urgently required.  It provides an opportunity to address the challenges facing the court.  It is crucial to address the significant volume of work before the courts and the workload.  Most importantly, it is in the interest of the administration of justice to do so.<\/p> <p> Why is it necessary to include this amendment in section 8 now?  It is urgently needed because, as I said, it provides an opportunity to address the challenges facing the courts in the pandemic, including the increase in backlogs of cases, increasing waiting times and the anticipated demand on the courts and the Courts Service.  Currently, the maximum permitted number of ordinary judges of the High Court is 37.  In total, there are 40 serving judges on the court.  However, one of these is the President of the High Court and two have been assigned to the Law Reform Commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, respectively.  The last time the number was increased was in 2015.  Of the 37 ordinary judges of the court, three are currently appointed to tribunals of investigation and to Judicial Council commitments and one has recently been nominated for appointment to the Court of Appeal.  Arrangements are being made for this appointment by the President.  In real terms, therefore, the number of judges available to sit in the High Court in the coming months will be reduced to 36, which is less than the maximum currently provided for in law.<\/p> <p> Finally, I thank Deputies for their engagement on this Bill.

That could happen to be one of the young people who have been referred to many times in the course of the debate, somebody who is simply there as a bartender or somebody who has taken over while, perhaps, the manager or the owner of the premises is away or at lunch.

On the definition section, we only had sight of the Bill yesterday and there was no pre-legislative scrutiny so perhaps we can have a little elucidation of the definitions from the Minister of State.  One of the issues, and the Minister of State mentioned it in her commentary as well, is that the number of seated patrons who can be accommodated in an area should not exceed the number of patrons who may be accommodated in the licensed premises.  Why is that necessary?  If, for example, one had a very small pub and for fire reasons it could not accommodate more than 40 people but one could accommodate 50 people happily in a forecourt area, why be so prescriptive about that and make it a point of conflict, perhaps, in terms of somebody counting the number of people who are properly seated and distanced in an outdoor seating area?  That seems to be an unnecessary addition in that regard.<\/p> <p>The definition of &quot;outdoor seating area&quot; in section 1 includes that it is &quot;on private land abutting the premises where ... the land is owned, or occupied by way of a lease or licence, by the licensee of the premises&quot; and &quot;a licence is not in force, or a certificate of registration under the Act of 1904 is not applicable and in force, in respect of the area&quot;.

I heard the Minister of State refer to it.  It is another example of overreach and overkill.  Deputy Howlin referred to it as well.  A small pub I know of in Ballylooby, Keating's, is closed, unfortunately.  It is a lovely thatched pub but it is impossible now to get insurance for the building.  It is never going to open again now thanks to the lockdown.  It was run by an elderly couple and I thank that lovely family for their service to the public over the years.  It was a tiny pub in a step down from a bend in the road in the lovely village of B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha L&uacute;baigh near Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh in Tiobraid &Aacute;rann theas.  The pub consisted of a tiny room that would fit into the backyard, which is much bigger.  Why is it necessary to insert in the legislation a requirement to have a seating area no greater outside than inside?<\/p>  <p>  My understanding of some of the seating arrangements that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle spoke of in Gaillimh and all over the country, and which was supported by Tipperary County Council, is that some of what is being installed is public seating.  It is a shared space.  Much was made of the Barcelona Declaration and that shared spaces can be used by patrons from any restaurant or by people who just want to sit down and drink a bottle of water they brought with them.  How is a publican going to enforce this regulation in an area outside?  If there are 22 people, will he ask four to leave because there are only 18 seats inside the premises?  I refer to normal times, not Covid times because premises may now only have three seats inside because of the restrictions.  <\/p>  <p>  This is overreach.  Whoever drafted this legislation certainly never stood behind a bar or shop counter and has no understanding of how to deal with the public.  We want the public to be with us and the majority are law-abiding citizens who respect business owners and have good banter and craic.  How is it going to be possible to insist that there must be the same number or less outside as inside?  It makes no sense.  We are going outside so that the economy can take off like a rocket, as the T&aacute;naiste talks about, and to build back better.  I did not know where that expression came from when I heard it first but I do now.  It did not come from the T&aacute;naiste, although he is using it.  It is being touted all over the world and there is a very specific reason for it.  <\/p>  <p>  How is it going to be possible to insist that people must get up and leave the outside part of a premises?  They may not be customers in the first place but customers of an adjoining bar or food outlet, or perhaps just resting.  This is farcical in the extreme.  We then have the non-descriptive nature of the licensee or the person in charge.  It could be a young person who is not vaccinated because he or she could not get the vaccine.  The person might be overseeing alone at a quiet time or covering a tea break or something like that.  Are these people going to be prosecuted?  Is the rush and indecent haste to draft the legislation causing these kinds of silly aspects to be included?  The requirement not to have more customers outside than inside turns the whole reason for outdoor dining and seating on its head.  \"Amuigh Faoin Sp&eacute;ir\" was a wonderful programme which used to be on television and being outside means being able to breathe in the lovely air.

It extends that Act to just &quot;an outdoor seating area&quot;.

He asked a very logical question.  While we may not agree on the primary purpose of a pub, the publicans that I know, and I am sure that he knows too, give far more than that.  They give service with a smile and they look after their customers.  They are ringing some of their customers to make sure they are all right because they have not seen them in more than 15 months.  They are telling them that they are open for outdoor drinking and that they can make them comfortable.  That is the kind of relationship between barmen and owners and their customers in pubs all over the country, but this is confusing.  It is mind-boggling.<\/p>  <p>  I have referred to the public seating in the square in Cathair D&uacute;n Iascaigh, which is a huge addition to the town.  I compliment Mr. John O'Meara and his team in the county council and everybody associated with it.  It is lovely to see people sitting out, especially when the weather is nice.  They sit out there on a Sunday morning before any pub is open and at different times throughout the day.<\/p>  <p>  There is a dilemma  here.  The Minister of State has said that there cannot be any more customers outside than would fit inside.  All the publicans want to do, as Deputy Howlin said, is fulfil their primary purpose which is to sell alcohol but they have a relationship as well.  This is not about them and us because we are in this together or whatever phrase was dreamt up with Covid.  They look after their customers, with the n&iacute; neart a chur le ch&eacute;ile and the f&aacute;ilte.  The tourists love to see it and they love to meet bar tenders, to interact with them and to find out about the culture in the area and so on.  People can congregate on the outside seating which is long and fronts a number of premises, including the Lazy Bean Caf&eacute;, a very popular eatery and several pubs, one of which has not reopened yet.  How is a garda to determine, on inspection, whether the people outside are patrons of this, that or the other pub or the eating house?  How are garda&iacute; going to implement this silly provision?  I urge the Minister of State to delete it.  It will not be possible to quantify.  It would be fine in situations where there is one pub in a village and nothing else around the yard or the public area but not on normal street scapes.  We saw images earlier of crowds outside Kennedy's pub but we do not know where they were from.  The barman would probably know because he is serving them but people can come and sit down and then move on again.  They can sit down in passing when they see someone they know and talk to them for a few minutes.  I know that the Government does not want us to talk to anyone any more.  It wants this country to be a lonesome, cold place like some European countries where they do not engage with people.  That is not the nature of the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte in the tigh tabhairne in Tiobrad Arann or anywhere else in the country.  It is a cultural experience, a discourse, exchange and interaction with people.  That is part of going into these places or sitting outside them.  <\/p>  <p>  This is not workable.  It is nonsensical to say that publicans cannot have any more outside than would fit inside because people could be customers of a number of premises, or none.  It is not workable.  We are supposed to be introducing legislation to help An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who we must support when they are being fair and even handed but garda&iacute; are going to be running around like ducks and drakes trying to find out whether people are in this or that pub.  It does not make sense.  If a garda or a health inspector visits a public house after hours or during hours, they deal with the people in it but when people are outside it is a different story because they might not be customers of the licensed premises.  As Deputy Murphy said, they could have purchased their drink in an off-licence up the street and then sat down.  How is the publican going to move them on?  There are measures in this Bill that are supposed to correct the unintended consequences of earlier legislation drawn up to support outdoor dining and drinking but the Government is making a bad situation worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000056#KKK01500","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1625071920,"counter":402,"content":"<p>I am a little confused.  Issues arise with regard to the licensee and the licensed premises because there are situations where the licensee is not the person who runs the bar.  The bar may be leased by the licensee to someone else.  The licensee applies for the licence each year but is seldom, if ever, on the premises and so it is outside of his or her control.  The other issue is that often the outdoor seating areas are in a public place, on a street or a square, for example and are shared.  People could order from the bar on the left hand side or the right hand side of the square and the order is brought to them. To be able to say which bar they are patronising depends on knowing from which premises they ordered and that might depend on which bar tender happened to be walking past at the time they sat down.  It is difficult to get clarity as to whether a premises has patrons outside equal to the number that could be accommodated inside.  That is something that needs to be sorted out.<\/p>  <p>  There are also situations, including in my own county, where the outdoor seating area is at the back of the bar and the only way a customer can get to it is to walk through the premises.  When they want to leave, they have to walk back through the premises again.  There are all kinds of different situations and we are trying to accommodate them all in legislation which, for some reason or another, is written a little tight.  It does not allow for the different situations that apply everywhere in the country.  <\/p>  <p>  There are situations where multiple premises are sharing the outdoor space in which people congregate and the seating thereon.  People can order food from one premises and at the same time, order alcohol from another.  Some effort must be made to clarify these issues as we move through this process.  I absolutely appreciate that this has been rushed, as others have said.  We need to stand back a little, while recognising that it will all fall, hopefully, on 30 November and is not here forever.  The maximum amount of space needs to be given to ensure that we have a regulated situation that will work for people.

While the sun might be shining down now, we really have to come back to the issue of indoor dining and when that will be allowed.<\/p>  <p>  I have heard speakers raising many different issues this evening.  I heard one Deputy in particular looking for more regulation of indoor dining at a time when we are not allowing it.  That bamboozled me.  It was confusing beyond belief to hear a Deputy seek to have further regulations imposed on people whose businesses have been shut for nearly a year and a half.  Where that Deputy was getting that brainwave from I do not know but this is not a time to be putting further regulations on an industry and a practice that are not allowed at present.<\/p>  <p>  As late as in the last hour, I have received phone calls, emails and text messages from people who are watching closely what is going on this evening.  They have heard what Members said and they have seen politicians in this House speak out of both sides of their mouths, in that we have Government Deputies who are saying one thing on national radio, and on local radio in their constituencies, and saying another thing to reporters but when they come in here, it is like \"The Silence of the Lambs\".  They are keeping their mouths shut, rowing in behind what the Government is saying and doing and blindly and loyally supporting the Government.  They are not raising one question.  That is why there is no one here to take Government slots when it comes to issues such as this.  The reason is that Government Deputies do not want to say anything.  They are speaking on the radio and everywhere else but not at all where it counts, namely, inside in this House.  When it comes to voting, they will loyally and blindly support the Government.  That is something I find hard to understand because they tell a different story to the individual business owners and representative organisations such as the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Restaurants Association of Ireland or the small business owners who are so desperately affected and impacted by the decision that has been made in the past 24 hours.  These people are really suffering.<\/p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group has been vocal and forthright in our statements about this issue.  We had a press conference today on the plinth and Deputy Mattie McGrath made it clear where we all stand.  When we are saying something we say it outside and inside this House.  How can politicians be true to themselves when they support the decisions that have been made at the last minute in recent days?  At the same time they think they can tell a different story to people in their constituencies, whether it is the workers or the business owners.<\/p>  <p>  In the great town of Killarney, or any of the places I represent, such as Sneem, Waterville, Killorglin and Listowel, the people are desperately impacted in a negative way and they are doing their best.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle should have seen the effort that has been made in putting up outdoor facilities, including canopies, tables and chairs.  These business owners are struggling and working so hard.  I saw staff painting and decorating and putting together these chairs and tables.  They were getting ready to open but it was all in the hope that this would be for a short time and then they would be able to move indoors on 5 July.  The next thing was the rug was pulled from underneath them in such a cruel and hurried fashion.<\/p>  <p>  Then there is the uncertainty of trying to tell people there will be a two-tier society in a couple of weeks' time if they get their act together.  It will be a case of whether someone has the vaccine or not.  I cannot see how anybody in the Government thinks they can ask a proprietor of a public house, restaurant or caf&eacute; to have somebody on guard at the door checking the people coming in to see who is vaccinated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000057#LLL00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1625072520,"counter":406,"content":"<p>I am sorry I have to interrupt the Deputy but the time permitted for this debate having expired, I am required to put the following question in accordance with an order of the D&aacute;il of 29 June: \"That in respect of each of the sections undisposed of, the section is hereby agreed to in committee; the Preamble and the Title are hereby agreed to in committee, the Bill is accordingly reported to the House without amendment, Fourth Stage is hereby completed, and the Bill is hereby passed.\"<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000057#LLL00300","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"vote","time":1625072520,"counter":407,"content":"<p>Question put:<\/p><p>The D\u00e1il divided: T\u00e1, 114; N\u00edl, 6; Staon, 0.<\/p><br\/><p>Tellers: T\u00e1, Deputies Brendan Griffin and Jack Chambers; N\u00edl, Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael McNamara.<\/p><p>Question declared carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000057#LLL00400","aye":["1587","1478","1625","1573","1618","1613","1549","1452","1523","1595","1614","1503","1611","1602","1482","1483","1517","1475","1495","1569","1493","1577","1501","1570","1457","1591","1585","1519","1571","1615","1481","1601","1476","1623","1558","1574","1584","1505","1562","1579","1608","1597","1590","1582","1449","1453","1581","1506","1624","1552","1566","1559","1620","1450","1619","1607","1604","1572","1583","1594","1472","1471","1626","1568","1546","1459","1548","1464","1455","1456","1497","1489","1628","1621","1578","1512","1561","1563","1550","1553","1516","1492","1593","1494","1598","1477","1507","1545","1521","1468","1617","1575","1498","1485","1510","1547","1509","1484","1473","1500","1465","1588","1567","1556","1564","1557","1479","1491","1596","1513","1474","1469","1627","1520"],"nay":["1461","1580","1487","1612","1518","1499"],"abs":[]},{"type":"unspoken","time":1625072520,"counter":408,"content":"<p>Deputy Holly Cairns did not vote in this division due to an agreed pairing arrangement with Minister Helen McEntee for the duration of the Minister&rsquo;s maternity leave.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":" Defence (Amendment) Bill 2020: Report and Final Stages","time":1625073120,"counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000058#NNN00100"},{"type":"speech","time":1625073120,"counter":410,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, may be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000058#NNN00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625073120,"counter":411,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 1:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 3, line 5, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960,&rdquo;. <\/blockquote>  <p>I will explain in my opening statement why the amendments are all tied together.  At the Committee Stage debate on this Bill, I indicated that I would bring forward a series of amendments on Report Stage to allow for members of the Reserve Defence Force, on a voluntary basis, to provide additional support to the Permanent Defence Force at home and overseas.  I am pleased to follow through on that commitment today.  The purpose of these amendments to the Defence Act 1954 is to set out the mechanism under which a member of the Reserve Defence Force may, on a voluntary basis, be deployed on military service, referred to in these amendments as supplemental military service.  Any such deployment will be where there is a particular deficiency in skills and expertise in the Permanent Defence Force, which would be addressed by the deployment of a member of the Reserve Defence Force on supplemental military service.<\/p><p>The amendments have been carefully drafted to underpin the voluntary nature of the supplementary military service.  In this regard, any deployment on supplemental military service may only take place where the member concerned has consented, in accordance with these amendments, to any such deployment.  The consent given by the member will indicate the nature and duration of military service that he or she is prepared to render, if requested.  In addition, deployment of the members of the Reserve Defence Force on supplemental military service will be subject to approval of the Minister.  As previously indicated, deployment will be for the purpose of filling a specific skills gap or where it is in the best interests of the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>I am particularly pleased that the amendments remove the absolute prohibition currently contained within the Defence Acts on members of the Reserve Defence Forces serving overseas.  As a consequence of these amendments, it will be possible for a contingent dispatched for overseas service to comprise membership from both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  I am confident that these amendments will significantly widen the opportunities for members of the Reserve Defence Force to provide support to the Permanent Defence Force.<\/p><p>As one might expect, following on from the legislative change to introduce the concept of voluntary military service for members of the Reserve Defence Force, there is a requirement to make a number of technical or consequential amendments to the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015.  These amendments include provisions to clarify that military law shall apply to a member of the Reserve Defence Force for the period for which he or she is deployed on supplemental military service, and to make consequential changes to certain sections of the Defence Act, specifically section 174 and section 182, to clarify matters arising from the application of military law.  In addition, the amendments provide that a member of the Reserve Defence Force who is serving overseas with an international United Nations force shall, in common with a member of the Permanent Defence Force serving overseas, be deemed to be on active service for the purpose of the Defence Act.  Furthermore, the amendments authorise the deployment of reservists on supplemental military service for service with, or be attached to, any staff, unit or other element to the Defence Forces.  Similar provisions already apply under section 95 of the Defence Act 1954, where a reservist is deployed on permanent service or in duties in aid of the civil power.<\/p><p>The amendments also clarify that a member of the Reserve Defence Force may not, while deployed on voluntary military service, participate in certain political activities.  Again, under the Defence Act 1954, similar restrictions already apply where a member of the Reserve Defence Force is called out on permanent service.  These technical or consequential amendments are necessary in the interests of the effective operation of the Defence Forces when the Bill - incorporating these amendments, which I hope will be the case - is enacted.<\/p><p>The programme for Government, within the framework of the proposed Commission on the Defence Forces, includes a commitment to carry out a review of the role of the Reserve Defence Force, including the question of deploying members of the force with special skill sets on overseas missions.  These amendments do not in any way preclude the Commission from examining comprehensively the role of the Reserve Defence Force, nor do they prejudice any possible recommendations from the Commission.  I am simply taking the opportunity in this legislation to facilitate any such recommendations by the Commission on a wider role for the Reserve Defence Force by removing the current legislative restrictions that are in place.<\/p><p>In summary, the purpose of these amendments is to provide the legal basis by way of enabling provisions to allow members of the Reserve Defence Force to serve in support of the Permanent Defence Force, at home and overseas, on a voluntary basis.  On that basis, I am bringing them before the House today.<\/p><p>In simple terms, we had good and quite long debates about this at previous Stages of this legislation.  I gave a commitment to Deputy Berry in particular but also to others that I would remove the legal restriction in the Defence Acts on reservists serving overseas.  We are, therefore, doing that now, having taken quite a lot of legal advice to make sure we do it properly.<\/p> <p>This will give the Government and the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is looking at the Reserve as well as many other issues, the ability to make recommendations and implement those recommendations as quickly as possible, rather than having to come back and introduce new legislation next year, which would take months or more.  Instead, we are removing a restriction I wanted to remove anyway because I would like to see the Reserve involved in more activity with the Permanent Defence Force, both at home and overseas.  I believe the Reserve can make a very significant contribution and these amendments allow us to move forward in that regard.<\/p> <p> The final point I want to make is on an issue that was raised with me by Deputy Berry.  I hope he is in the House.  Where members of the Reserve volunteer to serve overseas in the future, we would certainly look at employment protections for them.  If, for example, a reservist has a full-time job somewhere else, there should be an understanding with his or her employer that he or she could serve their country as a reservist, at home or overseas.  We will look seriously at how we can ensure we protect people in the context of their employment should they take up that role.  However, we cannot do that in this legislation.  It can only really be done by another Minister, potentially in the context of employment law.  It is something I am happy to consider in more detail over time.  We certainly will have plenty of time to do it because we must wait for the Commission on the Defence Forces to report, which it is due to do before the end of the year.  I am happy to work with Deputy Berry on that issue.<\/p> <p> In the meantime, the 15 amendments I am bringing forward today are sound.  They all deal with the same issue and make the necessary changes to legislation, as I committed to do on Committee Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000058#NNN00300","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625073720,"counter":413,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The changes set out in these amendments are necessary, as he stated, and for the betterment of the Defence Forces.  It is right and proper at this time for Members of the House to recognise the great work done by our full-time Defence Forces and Reserve personnel and the service they have given over the years, both here and overseas.  In particular, I know the Minister will be grateful and thankful for the excellent reputation our Defence Forces have had overseas going back decades and the respectability that they and the Irish flag carry when they go abroad on peacekeeping missions, where they serve for the good of people in places where there is disruption, strife and endangerment to life.  Their reputation precedes them when they go abroad.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p>  <p>  There is one issue about which I have a concern, as I am sure the Minister and everyone else have.  The rates of pay and remuneration for Defence Forces personnel have been a matter of contention at certain times and this is an issue that must be addressed.  We need to make the forces attractive for young people who wish to make a career in them, because it is a highly respectable career.  I have had the privilege over the years to know people who have served both full-time and in the Reserve.  In the village I come from, we have had highly respectable people serving in the Reserve all of their life.  It is right and proper to thank those people in a very ordinary and humble way for the service they have given to this country and to other people who needed their help and assistance.  They put themselves in harm's way in doing so.  For that, the least we should do is say, \"Thank you very much\".<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000059#OOO00300","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1625073720,"counter":415,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  I am not a member of the defence committee and nor am I suggesting I should be.  As a member of three other committees, my burden is enough.  My point is that I did not have the chance to debate the Bill in committee.  I am interested, therefore, in the expert views not only of the Minister but of Deputies who were involved in that debate.<\/p>  <p>  It struck me immediately when I read the amendments and the intention of the Minister that the issue of employment needs to be addressed.  While I understand this is a matter for another Department and Minister, we really cannot divorce the two issues.  I am interested to hear how this matter will be advanced.  I know the Minister has a very deep and personal interest in supporting our Defence Forces.  While we all have rightly praised the work of personnel over the years, we probably have not given them the underpinning in resources, including remuneration for the job they do, that is merited.  I hope that issue will be resolved.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to building a proper Reserve, particularly on the issue of the bespoke skill sets that are now needed, either on domestic duty here or, in particular, on foreign missions, is it envisaged that there would be a recruitment drive with a skills focus?  How will the Minister allow people who may have demanding day jobs to take the time off to train and be acknowledged in the way all of us in this House would like?<\/p>  <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on this group of amendments.  First, how far is he in discussions with the T&aacute;naiste on having a facility in place for automatic leave of absence to train for people who are interested in giving voluntary time as a reservist in our Defence Forces?  Second, in regard to deployment overseas, what sort of support to employers would be given by the State, or is too early to set out exactly what is envisaged?  In enacting this legislation, we are providing for something that really cannot be achieved until those other steps are taken.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000059#OOO00400","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"speech","time":1625073720,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I welcome these amendments, which Sinn F&eacute;in will support.  We debated the issues extensively in committee and I commend the Minister on following through on what he said he would do by bringing forward the amendments.  We know there are many challenges and difficulties within the Defence Forces.  The Permanent Defence Force is well below the established figure of 9,500, with membership currently in the region of 8,500.  Unfortunately, the Reserve Defence Force is considerably worse in terms of numbers.  The established figure is 4,169 but there is a 60% shortfall.  There is a huge gap that needs to be filled and I hope this important legislation will go some of the way to addressing it.<\/p>  <p>  There must be opportunities for meaningful operational service for reservists both domestically and overseas.  While the Bill will remove some of the impediments to allowing members of the Reserve to engage in that activity, there also needs to be meaningful employment protection.  It is interesting that the Minister has said those conversations have not started.  This is a critical piece of the puzzle and that engagement needs to begin immediately.  He also referred to the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is doing its work within a specific timeframe.  We hope it will come back with a completed report by the end of the year.  We have a narrow window to put in place the critical protections that are needed for members of the Reserve Defence Force.  It is to be hoped that this Bill will act as a catalyst to encourage more members of the community to join the Reserve and will help to retain them.  We need that employment protection to be put in place and the Minister must begin the discussions straight away to allow it to happen.<\/p> <p>The issue of remuneration must also be examined.  We know there are major challenges in the Permanent Defence Force in the context of pay.  We also know there are also huge issues with regard to the working time directive.  These must be addressed within the Permanent Defence Force and also, I imagine, within the Reserve Defence Force when members embark on domestic and overseas duties as a result of the proposed changes.  Ireland must be brought in line with EU regulations where the working time directive is concerned.  That is something the Minister must address and move forward.  Members of the Reserve Defence Force must be paid.  The concept of unpaid activities must be abolished and we must move the Reserve Defence Force into this century.  That can only be done by addressing that issue along with many others.  An hour for hour<i>pro rata <\/i>system should be introduced and all allowances available to the Permanent Defence Force should be available to members of the Reserve Defence Force for undertaking certain categories of activity as well.<br\/><br\/>While this is an important step forward in addressing some of the many challenges within the Defence Forces, particularly the Reserve Defence Force, I am under no illusions.  There is much more work that must be done.  It is incumbent now on the Minister to use this as a catalyst to progress matters and start addressing some of the many challenges facing our Defence Forces.  I said yesterday that morale within the Defence Forces is at an all-time low.  The Minister challenged me on that but I hope he has gotten to see the contribution RACO made at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence yesterday afternoon.  I will not repeat what its representatives said word for word but their contribution was very damning about where our Defence Forces stand at this point.  The Minister must move now.  He has, I hope, the support of the House on these amendments but he must move to ensure our Defence Forces are fit for purpose going forward and that the right protections are in place for all their members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000059#OOO00500","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625074320,"counter":418,"content":"<p>I have three brief points to add to the contributions I have made over the past couple of weeks.  First, I very much welcome this legislation.  This is a historic day for the Reserve Defence Force.  Its members have been screaming for this Bill for literally decades and it is finally here.  It really is a defining moment for the Reserve Defence Force.  It is 60% below strength but I see that as the low watermark for the Reserve and it can only get better from here.  I would of course like to see employment protection legislation included, but we should certainly lock in our gains tonight and look towards drafting suitable employment protection legislation in future, particularly after the Commission on the Defence Forces reports later this year, most likely in December.  We can take it from there.<\/p>  <p>  My second point is that this proves the problems in the Defence Forces are not insurmountable in any shape or form.  In fact, even long-standing issues like this can be completely fixed and this is a classic example of that.<\/p>  <p>  My third and final point relates to the Minister.  I got some excellent advice on the day before I took up my seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann from a gentleman in Portarlington called Matt Moore.  He said if the Minister wants it to be done, it will be done.  This legislation is a classic example of that.  The Minister took a personal interest in this project and within a short timeframe, we have had a very swift and very positive outcome.  The Minister should be commended for that.  However, I now ask that the Minister switch his focus from this Reserve Defence Force legislation onto the other issues raised by PDFORRA and RACO in the last few weeks at the joint committee.  Again, those issues are eminently solvable.  I very much look forward to engaging constructively with the Minister in that regard.  In summary, I welcome this historic Bill and look forward to supporting it later this evening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000060#PPP00200","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"speech","time":1625074320,"counter":419,"content":"<p>As has been said by others, this is very important legislation.  It is something that was badly needed and which people have been waiting on for years.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to respond to some of the points made by the Minister earlier and yesterday about morale and where we are now with the Defence Forces.  Last week, I spoke to a member of the Defence Forces who was just back from the Lebanon.  He is a man with a young family and he has been asked to go back out.  He was away seven months, between his deployment and the Covid-19 restrictions.  The Defence Forces are so badly stuck for trained personnel - and it ties into what is in the legislation about having the training and right personnel there - that they are looking for members who have just been out in Lebanon and Syria for seven months to go back out there because the personnel shortage is so bad.  These are the facts.  These men and women are happy to do their job and are happy to represent Ireland as peacekeepers and to go out to these areas.  However, it is very unfair to expect a man to be away from his family for so long because we are short personnel.  The reason for that, as we have known for years, is the terms, conditions and pay.  I know another member of the Defence Forces who is currently in the Lebanon.  For the last number of years, that person has had to work delivering pizzas so he and his partner could afford to get a mortgage.  Those are the facts.  A member of the Defence Forces could not get a mortgage until he got another job delivering pizzas at night and at the weekends, all because he and his partner wanted to buy a house.  That is where we are and that shows what the level of pay is.  It cannot be right that two people in good jobs, one of those being in the Defence Forces, could not get enough money for a mortgage.<\/p>  <p>  This legislation is important but we must go further because the people I am talking to want to stay in the Defence Forces.  They are proud to be in the Defence Forces but they do not feel they are appreciated or valued.  The Minister made a point yesterday about the private sector coaxing people out of the Defence Forces.  In my experience, from the people I speak to, the vast majority of them take the decision to leave the Defence Forces because they are looking for jobs that pay better money so they can get mortgages and look after their families.  It is all because they do not get paid enough.  Maybe some of them are being headhunted because they have very sought-after skills but the vast majority of people I speak to do it because they have to do it for their families, so they can have a good quality of life.  That is something we must now work on.  Today is a good first step but we have a long way to go because I remember being out protesting with families of Defence Forces members who are crying out for support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000060#PPP00300","speaker":"1453"},{"type":"speech","time":1625074320,"counter":420,"content":"<p>I thank all Members for their contributions.  The one common theme is that everyone contributing to this debate values our Defence Forces, their skill set, the quality of the training they have and the role they play both at home and abroad.  I put on record the extraordinary contribution and service of the Defence Forces through the 16 months or so of the pandemic.  They have been invaluable, be that with mandatory hotel quarantine, providing transportation, taking test samples to Germany, setting up vaccination centres or indeed helping to run such centres.  I got my second vaccine this morning in Cork City Hall and the first person I met when I entered the building was a member of the Defence Forces.

I hope this legislation is a reminder to people that not only do we want to maintain and protect the Reserve but that we want to grow the numbers in the Reserve significantly until it reaches a strength of more than 4,000.  It is where we would like to be, despite the fact we are at just under 2,000 currently.  This is sending a very clear signal that we would like to see the Reserve involved with more activity overseas as well as at home.  We are removing the legal restriction that has been in place for decades that has prevented this.<\/p> <p> There will be a series of recommendations relating to the Reserve, its future and its role with the Permanent Defence Force coming from the Commission on the Defence Forces in a few months.

I will speak to the amendments tabled by People Before Profit.  They relate to the Title of the Bill and, essentially, the setting out of its purposes and the purpose of the Land Development Agency, LDA.  In some ways, the amendments in this group are a summary of many of the problems we have with the Government's plan for the LDA and what it should do.  I will try to summarise them briefly.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA should be an agency that assembles land and, in particular, land that might be hoarded or speculated upon by private owners and developers or property that is being sat on that could be used, if suitable, for the housing we need to address the dire housing crisis.  That is what the LDA should be.  Its sole purpose should be to try to assemble land that may be in the ownership of other State agencies for the purposes of delivering public and affordable housing.  A failure to do this is the reason for the dire housing and homelessness crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA's purpose, as set out in this Bill, amounts to a means through which private finance, developers and property investment entities and so on will gain access to the entire public land bank.  The latter should be used to deliver public and affordable housing but will instead be used to make profit for some of those interests.  This, in turn, will affect the ability of the Government to use the public land bank to deliver public housing of the scale we need and to ensure that it is genuinely affordable instead of the price being set by private developers or financial interests which now might gain access to that land bank.<\/p>  <p>  In the Title to the Bill, there are references to designated activity companies, DACs, and the Bill will allow the public land bank to be parcelled into companies that will be taken from local authority control and these will, in effect, control the land bank and dictate what is done with it.  There are also references in the Title to market price with respect to the delivery of affordable housing.  I see the Minister shaking his head because the term has been changed with a reference to the affordable housing legislation.  When we cross-check the new wording inserted via the Minister's amendment and the affordable housing legislation, we can see it does not set out in any clear terms how it can be guaranteed that the public land bank will be used to deliver genuinely affordable housing.  It will all be prescribed by the Minister and there are also references to the market.  This is the fundamental problem.<\/p>  <p>  In the amendments we have tabled, we are seeking to ensure that the LDA will only be about the provision of public and affordable housing.  We also want to ensure that affordable housing will always remain affordable.  We will explain later how that should be done but, essentially, we suggest that a property cannot be sold to the market but rather that it must be sold to local authorities.  The proportion of affordable and public housing should be decided by local authorities and there should be public consultation on that.  The land should not be parcelled up for use by DACs, it should remain in the hands of the local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  Our amendments rule out the use of public private partnerships, thus protecting the public land bank from the invasion of private investment funds, speculators and so on that would drive up the price of the affordable housing.  Such partnerships might privatise potentially significant parts of the public land bank and make it almost certain that much of the supposedly affordable housing would be unaffordable.  The Minister has infamously spoken about affordable housing in certain parts of the country, notably in Dublin, reaching a ceiling of &euro;450,000 and &euro;400,000 and &euro;350,000 in other areas.<\/p> <p>That is not affordable at all for the vast majority of people.  We do not want private finance or private investors to have anything whatsoever to do with setting the amount of public and affordable housing, the price of the affordable housing or the rents in the cost-rental housing.  We want stripped out of both Bills any references to the benchmarking of affordability against market conditions or the diktats of private finance.<\/p> <p> That is the summary of the first 12 of 63 amendments we have tabled to the Bill.  The broad thrust is very simple.  Keep the public land bank public, use the public land bank to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing and have no privatisation whatsoever of the public land bank, which we believe the Government's Bill in its current form will facilitate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000061#QQQ03600","speaker":"1478","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625075520,"counter":458,"content":"<p>I am very glad of the opportunity to speak on the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  This is terribly important work.  It is also terribly important that we strike a balance.  On a personal basis, Deputy Boyd Barrett knows that I like him as a person, and he always cheers me up when we meet each other, but I have to say I would hate to rely on him to build even a henhouse.  If we were relying on him, the henhouse would never get built.  I do not like to personalise but while a lot of what Deputy Boyd Barrett has said is correct and right, we cannot have the demonising in this House of the whole public-private issue as if there is something wrong with developers, those who want to build housing and those who want to work in that sector because that is not the case.<\/p>  <p>  What I dearly want to see for our publicly-owned land is that, in as big a way as possible, the Government, the Department and local authorities would build affordable housing to try to address the massive housing need we have.<\/p>  <p>  I attended a very important meeting yesterday where projected statistics for the whole population for the next 12 months, two years, three years and ten years were looked at very closely and analysed.  When I studied this to understand it and get it into my head the enormity of the problem facing us, I have to be honest that the projected need for housing frightened me.<\/p>  <p>  I do not doubt that Deputy Boyd Barrett is 100% passionate about what he is saying.  He is right in his own mind about what he is saying but it seems to be all anti private involvement in anything and that we should be doing it.  The message I have is that we are incapable of doing it.  I would love if we were able to do it.  I would be so proud.  I am not blaming the Minister, as he knows, when I say this.  It does not matter if it was this Minister in this Government, the previous Government, the one before that, or the Government of ten or 20 years ago.  We must have public and private working together.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right about certain things but it must be remembered that people have to make a profit.  There has to be a profit margin made in anything a person does in life.  If you buy a cow and want to keep it for 12 months, the cow has to have a calf, must produce milk and you have to make money, even if it is a marginal amount because there are costs to be met.  It is the same for employers who are involved in delivering housing.  They have to provide the housing and it has to be sold at an affordable price.  I could not agree more.  When I see the exorbitant prices of property and the enormous rents being charged in certain parts of the country, my goodness, we have to do something to try to rein this in and bring control to the situation.<\/p>  <p>  Does the Deputy realise what is happening tomorrow?  Does he know about tomorrow?  Maybe he would not mind too much about it.  Timber prices are going up 10%, 15% and 17% tomorrow.  Does the Deputy realise that in the past 12 months alone, the prices of steel and timber have gone up enormously?  One cannot pull that money out of the sky.  It is not Monopoly money; it is real money.  This is what is affecting the price of housing so detrimentally, whether it is in the private market, the public market or whatever market.  That is the reality.  The costs of one metre of concrete and concrete blocks have gone up, as has the price of steel.  Does the Deputy realise that?<\/p>  <p>  These are the considerations we must take on board in a practical and common-sense way, rather than demonising all the time and shout about there being absolutely no private involvement and about not letting these people come in on our land.  I would love to see that happening and I would love it if we could do it all ourselves, but we cannot.  We must work together and try to ensure that, at the end of the day, we are providing the maximum amount of properties, available at affordable money to our young families to get them off the housing waiting lists.  Every day of the week, I deal with the housing list in Kerry.  I would dearly like to see our local authority starting to build single rural cottages, schemes of houses like it used to do long ago when John O'Donoghue from Farranfore would go into a field on behalf of the council and set out a housing development, and then go in to build five, ten, 20, 30, 40 or 60 houses.  Was that not great work?  There is not enough of that happening now.  We must ensure that if we cannot do it ourselves, we bring brains, skill and ability together in conjunction and to partner up, to try to ensure we provide the housing one way or another in the best and most affordable way we can.<\/p>  <p>  We have had excellent people working in our local authority in Kerry over the years.  It is not that we do not have the people now - we do - but we must pool our resources.  Rather than criticising the Minister in this House and saying, \"Damnation on you and all that is there with you\", it should be the exact opposite.  We should be saying to the Minister that there is a very serious problem with housing in this country.  Rather than the Opposition knocking that and fighting about it, we should be asking how can we collectively put our shoulders to the wheel and work together to ensure the money is made available and we can do this in an affordable way.  There seems, however, to be very little we can do about the massive increases in the costs of raw materials.  It is a worldwide issue at the moment.  The prices for materials have gone up dramatically in the last 12 months.  This is a massive problem.<\/p>  <p>  There is a responsibility on every one of us to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Minister and the Department, not knocking but working together in trying to address the problem.  We must use our imaginations and the brains that God gave us to try to work together in a positive way to address the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000062#RRR00200","speaker":"1487"},{"type":"speech","time":1625075520,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The Green Party firmly believes that the primary remit of the Land Development Agency should be to utilise public land for 100% public housing.

Today, on foot of my amendments to the Bill, the Minister has agreed to ensure that all housing in Dublin and Cork will be 100% public, including cost-rental, social and affordable homes.  The provision of public housing on public land will assist in increasing the number of cost-rental units the State will provide.

A grouping list has not been circulated.  Not that it is essential but if there is one that could be made available to members, it would be of great help.<\/p>  <p>  One of the perplexing things about the Land Development Agency is why, under its Fine Gael proposition and now under the proposal in front of us from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, it is proposed in the way that it is.  There is no doubt we need public agencies to build increasing numbers of social and affordable homes.  Nobody in the House disagrees with any of this.  The difficulty, of course, is we already have many of these agencies.  There are more than 30 local authorities, many of which, for decades, had a sterling track record in delivering large volumes of very good quality homes.  The difficulty is that since the 1990s under Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments, then under Fine Gael and Labour Party Governments, then under Fine Gael and Green Party Governments and now under a Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Green Party Government, those local authorities have been asset-stripped.  They have been stripped of staff and money and, crucially, of the authority to deliver the homes working people need.  In fact, when Fine Gael was last considering how to fix the housing crisis, rather than proposing a land development agency, which is a State agency that would take up to five years to build any homes, what it should have done was resourced with finance and staff our local authorities to build the tens of thousands of social and affordable homes for working families.  Fine Gael's original proposition was a very bad one.  It wanted to have large volumes of new homes but it did not want to pay for them.  It had the idea of leveraging, as Deputy Duffy said, up to 60% of the homes delivered on public land to the private sector to ensure 10% social and 30% affordable housing.  Of course, this produced a huge backlash and, in fairness to the current Minister, he was very critical, as were those of us in opposition, of that particular usage because at a time when public land is so scarce and the need for social and affordable housing is so great there should of course be 100% affordable housing on public land.<\/p>  <p>  The current version of the Bill has moved some way and I want to acknowledge a number of changes the Minister has made to the original draft of the Bill and during the course of the Bill's passage through the House that have improved it somewhat.  However, it still contains the fatal flaw that, notwithstanding the fact the Minister has introduced an amendment that allows him to set up to 80% of a development as social and affordable housing - and I presume the remaining 20% would be covered by Part V - it does not guarantee it.  It is not the case, contrary to what Deputy Duffy said, that the Bill guarantees all homes on public land in Dublin and Cork would be affordable.  That would be at the discretion of the Minister.  Yes, it is better that the Minister can designate up to 100% than up to 50%.  However, if he chooses not to do so and decides, for example, that it will not be 100% on the Central Mental Hospital site in Dundrum, there is nothing anybody in the House can do about it.  Likewise, for example, because the power of local authorities and elected members to determine what happens on their land is being taken away by the Bill, if the Minister decides, for example, in direct opposition to the democratic will of a majority of councillors on Dublin City Council, to transfer the Oscar Traynor Road site to the LDA, there is no guarantee we will not revert to the Glenveagh deal that would have seen 50% of the homes sold at unaffordable open market prices of more than &euro;400,000.<\/p>  <p>  My fundamental objection to the Bill, and the reason I support this list of amendments, is not that I do not want public homes built on public land.  I do.  However, I believe the best agency to do this is our local authorities, led by local authority councillors supported by approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.<\/p>  <p>  I will directly respond to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, because I absolutely agree with one of his central points.  Every home built in the State today is built by a private build contractor, whether it is a social home, an affordable home or a private home.  Certainly on my side of the House there is nobody objecting to this.  In fact, the only way we will get large volumes of homes built is if we release public land, with local authorities or the approved housing bodies being the developers, and employ as many of those building contractors as possible to build as many good quality homes as possible at the fastest possible rate.<\/p>  <p>  What I understand Deputy Boyd Barrett is objecting to, and I share his objection, is not to individual tradespeople being employed in those sites.  It is to when land is transferred or the Land Development Agency enters into partnership with private developers, which is a very different thing from a private building contractor, as I am sure the good Deputy from Kerry knows.  When a private developer is brought onto the pitch it changes the overall financing of the project and, therefore, the development costs go up.  This means the rent and the purchase prices are also higher for working families, whether in Kerry, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Rathdown or my constituency of Dublin Mid-West.<\/p>  <p>  What many of us are essentially saying is that where we have public land it should be developed in the first instance by public authorities, local authorities, approved housing bodies and community housing trusts.  They should, of course, employ tradespeople and building contractors to build those homes, although some of us would like to see a return, at least in some local authorities, to direct build by councils.  While we are arguing for this, we will have the private building contractors build as many of the homes as possible.<\/p>  <p>  The great tragedy of using the particular model the LDA will use is that the rents will be too high.  I fear the house prices will also be too high.  Unlike local authorities and approved housing bodies, where the rents that will be charged or the house prices will be on a full cost recovery basis, the LDA will operate like a commercial entity.  I accept it is publicly owned but it will be like a commercial entity.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister has made positive amendments to the legislation so the LDA and all of its designated activity company subsidiaries will be fully covered by freedom of information.  I presume the Minister will give us an update later on what is happening with the lobby register, and we expect the LDA's officials will become designated officials under the lobby register legislation.  However, because it is a designated activity company it will be able to conceal its activities behind the smokescreen of commercial sensitivity and we will not get the same opportunity to scrutinise it as other bodies.<\/p>  <p>  I support the amendments because I want to see the maximum volume of social and affordable homes delivered on public land but at genuinely affordable prices and the Bill does not provide for this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000063#SSS00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1625076120,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will speak in support of the amendments.  I start with the point on the delivery of homes on public lands, who does it and whether private builders are involved.  There is a key distinction that needs to be made and Deputy &Oacute; Broin has made it.  In terms of delivering homes, there is a huge difference between contracting tradesmen and private builders and having a private developer leading the project.  There is a difference in cost to this.  If private developers are involved, they have higher financing costs than are available to the State or to not-for-profit bodies borrowing through State or European funding mechanisms.  This pushes up the cost of delivery, which means the price of the affordable purchase, or the rent if it is cost rental, will be more expensive at the end when someone is coming to buy or to rent.<\/p>  <p>  If we look at the &Oacute; Cualann model, and I have referenced it often in the D&aacute;il, we see two-bedroom apartments available in Dun Emer in Lusk for approximately &euro;166,000 and three-bedroom semi-detached homes being available at &euro;258,000.  They are being built by private builders and private contractors but &Oacute; Cualann, a not-for-profit housing co-operative, is the developer.  It has a margin that it takes to reinvest in future schemes but it is not taking the type of profit margins from it that a private developer would.  This makes a huge difference to the overall delivery cost because its aim is to deliver homes at the most affordable amount it can achieve.  This is what it is trying to do rather than private developers trying to maximise their returns and profits, which is their right and business.<\/p>  <p>  Private developers play a huge role in housing delivery in Ireland and will continue to do so.  The question here is whether we can maximise the amount of affordable, social and cost-rental homes on public land.  This is the question.  It is true that progress is being made on this.  The Bill is much better than previous proposals from the previous Fine Gael-led Government.  It is welcome that the Minister is speaking about, and giving commitments to, 100% social, affordable and cost-rental housing on public lands in Dublin and Cork.  The Bill does not guarantee this.  It allows for it.  It does not prohibit it but it does not guarantee it.  If the Minister changes his mind, there is a different Minister in office, different circumstances are cited or agreement on financing is not reached at government level, the Bill allows for 40% of homes on public lands to be sold at full market cost.<\/p> <p>Why would we do that at any time, especially in the middle of a housing and affordability crisis?  Why are we presented with a Bill that allows for that, notwithstanding the improvements that have been made?  I do not think it makes sense that the Bill allows for that.<\/p> <p> I have another concern regarding the delivery of affordable housing under this Bill.  The vision given so far of affordable homes that will be delivered means many of them could be set at a price beyond the reach of people on average incomes.  There is no definition of affordability in the Bill or in the Affordable Housing Bill that would set affordable homes within reach of people on average incomes.  There is talk of affordable homes but how affordable will these homes be?  There will be homes available for people at a discount from full market price, so that will help some, but will there be housing available for people who do not qualify for social housing and have the ability to pay a mortgage up to around &euro;250,000?<\/p> <p> There is a significant risk that the cost rental homes mentioned in the Bill will not be delivered at fully cost rental because the Affordable Housing Bill, which is related to this, includes references to equity returns.  If there are equity returns on the delivery of cost rental, it is not at cost.  It is cost plus equity plus equity returns.  The entire point of the Bill should be to ensure there is the maximum amount of affordable, social and cost rental homes delivered on all public lands, rather than some or some parts of public lands.  That should be what we are trying to achieve.<\/p> <p> The other thing missing is the ability to build up a pipeline of land that could be used to deliver affordable and social homes.  The strong compulsory purchase order, CPO, powers that should be in this Bill are not there and it is a major weakness.  If the Land Development Agency is not being set up to buy land at existing land-use value before it is rezoned to create and capture the value of land rezoning to help deliver infrastructure and housing affordability, then what is the agency about?  Is it not missing a key role in strategic land assembly that should be to the forefront of this? Recent reports from the executive in Meath County Council, for example, have said it is having difficulty buying land that can be used in the future for social and affordable housing because it is competing with developers who are paying higher prices, including for agriculturally zoned land.  When the executives of councils and local authorities try to do this, the CPO powers which they lack and which the Land Development Agency will lack mean there is no solution.  We should be ensuring that land value capture, which is done well in other countries to deliver affordability and pay for infrastructure, is done by an LDA with CPO powers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000063#SSS00200","speaker":"1550","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625076720,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I do not think there is one person in this House who does not want social and affordable houses to be built for people of different generations so they can begin their lives.  What I have against the way the LDA is set up is it caters for population centres of 30,000 or more.  I was elected in Limerick county and there is not one town in Limerick county with 30,000 people living there.  While I welcome any houses coming to Limerick city, Limerick should be treated as a whole.  The Land Development Agency is only delivering for cities.<\/p>  <p>  Successive governments for 33 years have promised to invest in infrastructure in County Limerick.  I have said on more than one occasion that infrastructure, sewerage systems and adequate water are waiting for investment promised by Minister after Minister.  At every election that comes our way, they promise they will put funding into infrastructure.  Askeaton is one example that is 33 years waiting for a sewerage system upgrade.  Drumcolliher and Hospital are others.  A report done during the year showed the biggest polluter in Ireland is a local authority because of the lack of infrastructure and raw sewage being put into the waterways.<\/p>  <p>  The Minister is capable in the job he is in and I have faith in him.  However, this does not deliver outside population centres of 30,000 or more.  It does not deliver for the people of County Limerick.  The Minister's party has been in government going back decades and still has not delivered on promises through all the elections to put in infrastructure and give equality to the people in cities, towns, villages and rural areas.  That would mean people could live in local areas, whether towns, villages or rural areas, and they would support locally.  We would have our own infrastructure and it would bring businesses to our areas to support locally.  How can anyone be expected to open a business in an area where they are told there is a cap?  People are told: \"You have what you have now and what infrastructure you have we are going to upgrade but that it will not mean you will have extra houses\".  They are told the infrastructure will be upgraded it so it does not pollute the area as much.  Any businessperson will say that to get people into an area and to support people and businesses in the area, basic infrastructure is needed.  Limerick has been crying out for investment in infrastructure for 30 or 40 years and it has been failed by governments. <\/p>  <p>  Limerick 2030 was set up.  I was on the board before being elected here and now my brother John is on it.  There are executives from Limerick City and County council and local councillors from around Limerick county and city on it.  They are trying to deliver for the people of Limerick city and county.  Unless the LDA works with the likes of the local authority and Limerick 2030, Limerick county will not get investment.  Traditionally, Deputies have been promised that but now we know that, even with the LDA, the Government will not invest in our areas.  When people want to build their own houses, put in infrastructure, septic tanks and water supply, the Government votes against amendments for that.  It will not even allow people build in their own areas or put in infrastructure to support those areas.  This Bill needs to make sure the number goes down to 1,500 or lower to ensure the LDA covers city and county.  It is called equality.  Not everyone wants to live in the city.  I am a culchie and proud of it.  That is where I grew up and what I support.  I support locally.<\/p> <p> I have been listening to Deputies talk about developers and contractors.  I have been a building contractor all my life.  I have been in the building trade since I was 15 years of age.  I have seen all the different elements of building and how difficult a job it is.  The price of housing has increased by &euro;40 per square foot in the past 12 months.  While it is a global issue, the Government could have helped by issuing felling licences and easing restrictions at ports so that we could bring in material and prevent extra costs.  The price of a house has been added to by &euro;40 per square foot, yet the Government talks about social and affordable housing.  The increase means that the price of public sites, which would normally be approximately &euro;17,000 per service unit on a housing estate, has jumped to approximately &euro;27,000 per service unit.  There is nothing affordable about that.<\/p> <p> I ask the Minister to consider the counties and dropping the population threshold from 30,000 people to 1,500 people to ensure that houses are built in rural areas and everyone can have equality and avail of social and affordable housing.  The councils in our areas cannot build houses at the moment.  They need contractors to do that, but there are no contractors.  We need help, investment and infrastructure to do this work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000064#TTT00200","speaker":"1499","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625077320,"counter":465,"content":"<p>I wish to speak against this group of amendments.  There is a fundamental difference between the Opposition and the Government in how we want to deliver homes and what we want the LDA to do.  It is clear from Committee Stage that those in opposition want it to be a land amalgamation agency and local authorities to then construct homes on that land.  The Government wants all parts of the State firing on all cylinders.  Using the Affordable Housing Bill, we want to ensure that councils build social housing and housing for affordable rental and affordable purchase on council land.  We want the LDA to build social housing and housing for affordable rental and affordable purchase on its public land.  We want approved housing bodies to build social housing and housing for affordable rental and affordable purchase.  We want every arm of the State building and developing homes for people, including families.  We do not want a quango that amalgamates land.  We want an agency that delivers homes.  That is a fundamental and important policy difference between the two parts of the House.<\/p>  <p>  I will also speak against these amendments because of an attempt to put in place the narrative that this Government is somehow trying to siphon off homes to developers so that we can fleece the people of Ireland.  Deputy Cian O'Callaghan asked us why we would do that, but I will put the question back to him - why would we do that?  The Minister has been clear from the beginning that there has been no attempt to do that.  His amendments ensure that in places like Dublin and Cork, we have 100% public housing on public land.  They give a legislative basis to what we have talked about, called for, marched for and voted in councils for.  Here we are with a Bill that allows for 100% public housing on public land.<\/p>  <p>  This happened because the people of Ireland voted for parties that wanted to ensure a change in the direction of housing policy.  It happened because those parties came together to compromise, put together a programme for Government, form a Government and then work on, amend and perfect legislation to deliver for the people who voted for them as well as those who did not.  To the people who voted for me, the Minister, Deputy Duffy, Deputy Higgins, Senator Cummins, Senator Fitzpatrick and the many other Members who have worked on this Bill, I say that their vote in February of last year has ensured a change in the direction of housing policy so that we have 100% public housing on public land in those places where it is needed.  That is delivering.  That is the difference between the Opposition and the Government in this regard.  We have a real ambition to deliver homes for people.  It is not about siphoning off land to developers.  In the words of the Opposition, why would we do that?  Instead, it is an attempt by the Minister to ensure that we can deliver homes for people.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill has been described as the Minister taking a second-hand car and giving it a coat of paint.  I have heard Deputies in the House acknowledge the changes that he has made to the Bill.  Last week, however, Opposition Deputy after Opposition Deputy stood up for his or her little one-minute speaking slot on the extension of tenancy protections and said that this Government was doing nothing for housing.  It is time to admit that in the space of 12 months, we have passed substantial legislation on housing and put in place significant tools that will shape public housing policy for the next 30 years.  We have put in place tools that councils can use to build affordable homes and mixed communities on their lands.  The LDA, approved housing bodies and organisations like &Oacute; Cualann can do the same.  It is important that we acknowledge this, as these measures will take some time before they are delivered and the public has to know that a real change was delivered after the message sent at the general election.  We are being honest by saying that it will take some time to build the homes because we know that building homes takes time.<\/p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing project after project in my area.  I am referring to sites in Kildonan, the multiple sites in Ballymun that make up the Ballymun local area plan, and sites in Whitehall and on Oscar Traynor Road.  I am looking forward to seeing homes that people can afford.  I am looking forward to people coming to my office and being able to ask me how to apply for the new homes that the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il and this Government are building.  That will be the proof of the pudding.<\/p>  <p>  We have a long way to go.  We must ensure that the review of the national development plan reflects the ambition of this Bill, that there is significant investment in housing and that we put our money where our mouth is.  We must ensure that councils across the country grab the Bill's ambition and do not allow council officials to delay it.  Councillors must drive the delivery of homes, including public housing, and ensure that the sites their councils own are turned from empty sites, which the Minister and I visited many times while Fianna F&aacute;il was in opposition, into building sites and then into communities where people live.  We must ensure that council officials realise that there has been a change and that the delivery of housing for affordable purchase has to be the core of what they do.  I join my colleagues in saying that local authorities should publish targets for the delivery of housing for affordable purchase on all of their sites.<\/p>  <p>  Communities like Ballymun and Finglas have been let down by previous housing policies because we have not put in place infrastructure, services or mixed income and mixed tenure housing.  We must ensure that the projects we deliver benefit these communities.  I look forward to the end of the strategic housing development, SHD, legislation, as it bypassed communities.  I look forward to us making another change in housing policy, thereby recognising the message that we were given by people in February 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Substantial changes and amendments have been acknowledged but equally opposed by the Opposition.  There will be substantial delivery of homes for families and young people with real actions and real results.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000065#UUU00200","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speech","time":1625077320,"counter":466,"content":"<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important topic.  Many Deputies have done a great deal of talking and it is time for action.  I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best in the position he now holds and I have confidence that he will continue trying to do that.  We disagree about certain matters.  I am worried that, down the line, this legislation will erode the powers of elected members and local authorities.  I am also worried that the LDA might be accountable to no one.<\/p>  <p>  Publicly owned land should be used 100% for social housing.  Making some parts of a development private and others affordable and social will not work.<\/p> <p>Each development on public lands should be publicly owned.  Houses should be built to be rented.  Affordable houses should be built to be sold.  If possible, sites should be sold to couples or individuals who want to build a house.  If they qualify for social housing, they should be allowed to buy a site.  I am very worried about the publicly owned lands we have in Killarney, like the very valuable St. Finan's site.  I have been striving for many years to ensure this land is transferred from the HSE back to Kerry County Council, from where it came from in the first place, and that local authority houses would be built on that site.  We need them in Killarney.<\/p> <p> Builders and developers are doing a great job where they can, but they are up against it at present with the cost of materials, especially timber.  If a person is looking for timber for a house in Kerry, there is a six-week waiting time and suppliers will not say how much it will cost until it arrives.  At the same time, we cannot fell trees in our forestry.  In Ireland, no one can get a felling licence, yet in Germany and other countries, there is no such thing as a felling licence.  It is well known that when one plants a forestry, it has to be cut down when it is mature and available.  Now we are importing timber.<\/p> <p> The regulator we have is against one-off houses, people who are trying to build houses themselves.  Those people should be supported in every way.  There are several designations preventing them from building at this time.  It is difficult to get planning in many parts of County Kerry.  That is not right because all people want to do is to put a roof over their heads and make a home.  They should get every assistance in doing that from us, as elected Members of the Oireachtas, and from the Department, the Minister, the Government and the local authorities.  They are finding it very difficult at present.<\/p> <p> We have been told that money is no object, that houses will be built and that there is no problem, yet we have major problems with sewerage infrastructure as there are places with no facilities.  There are 32 settlements in Kerry that have no sewerage treatment facility.  There are 17 towns and villages waiting for extensions to their plants.  People cannot build in the town of Kenmare.  They can get planning permission but they cannot build there until the treatment plant is extended.  Zoning and dezoning designation is what is happening in Kerry.  The local authority members have been told they can increase the amount of land zoned around Killarney, but they must dezone land in places like Rathmore and outside of that area.  That is not fair, nor is it right because people want to live in their areas.  They are being denied that right by two things - zoning designations and the non-existent sewerage facilities.  It is a problem in places like Beaufort which is a large village that could expand but has no treatment plant.  There are two housing estates there that are in a terrible state.  The local authority has to draw the sewage out of the estates every week and bring it into the Killarney treatment plant.  Things like that are happening in Currow.  There is no treatment plant in Scartaglen or Asdee.  There are honest good hardworking people from those places and they deserve to be able to put a roof over their heads.  It is not right, and I appeal to the Minister to deal with that issue.  The Government says money is not a problem.  It may not be nice to speak about sewage in this House, but if people do not have proper facilities, they cannot build homes.  It is very important that we raise this matter.<\/p> <p> Small-scale builders and developers are finding it very difficult to continue because of the levies, regulations and VAT.  They have all those things to deal with while they have to carry the costs.  It is very difficult to get money from the banks.  The Minister must consider this issue.  They have to carry the cost to the very end because stage payments are not allowed anymore.  There are many small-scale builders and developers who are going out of business because they cannot continue.  If you have no money, you have no fun.  That is the situation with small-scale builders and developers now.  They cannot afford to carry the full costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000065#UUU00300","speaker":"1580","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625077920,"counter":468,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat a Theachta.

I will speak about housing, an issue I have spoken about since 2016.  I do not point the finger at the Minister because he has been most helpful with housing issues in west Cork that I have approached him about.<\/p>  <p>  I raise urgent issues which need to be addressed in relation to the provision of homes for young people and people of all ages who call me daily.  It was said earlier that it was unfair to say that nothing is being done on housing.  I hear about the problems in my constituency clinic.  For every ten people who come into me, six of them have housing issues.  I know of the upset and torture some people are going through because they cannot get started in life.  Some of them cannot get a house or a mortgage.  They have a good average job but it is not good enough to get a mortgage.  They are then pushed into the trap of having to apply for social housing.  They find that social housing is not available.  Regarding renting a house, often HAP is not available to them.  They are in a trap and they cannot get out of it, and this causes upset and difficulties.  There are solutions out there.  The Land Development Agency Bill seems to deal with a population of 30,000 or more.  That exempts most of my constituency unless we bottle it all together.  The Bill must look at areas in my county and others, like Clonakilty, Skibbereen, Bantry, Bandon, Kinsale and areas like those that continue to have a housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  One good thing I notice about people - they are the people I listen to a lot - is that some of them try to come up with solutions and get over the issues themselves.  Many young people come to me to see whether I can help them get planning.  Some of them had already applied and had thought it was a fair system.  They thought they would get a fair answer but they come up against stumbling blocks.  More people come to me before they apply for planning permission.  The stumbling blocks that are put before them are terribly unfair.  We are pushing people down one road, and that road is social housing.  We have a T&aacute;naiste who dreams that he will build 40,000 homes a year.  I do not know what side of the bed he got out of that morning when he announced that.  RT&Eacute; gave him as much coverage as he wanted for two days to talk about 40,000 homes.  When he was in office, he was only able to build a few thousands.  All of a sudden, he is dreaming that he can build 40,000.  Perhaps he has them in the back of the car and he can open them up.  Perhaps they will be built with toy bricks.  In reality, that is not going to happen and he has to be honest.  He should not put a false belief out there that we are going to get 40,000 homes built.  The problem is with the trap this country is in.  It will have to keep building and building.  It will dream that it will keep building, that there will be cities and skyscrapers built and that people will be living in apartments.  Living in an apartment is a terribly difficult life, and I know from looking at some of them around the cities.<\/p>  <p>  A solution to much of this can be found in rural Ireland and it is not being looked at.  There is a fear of God out there in case we were to build and start a rural community.  A number of years ago, county development plans contained village nuclei.  That was when county development plans worked with the people.  Now they work against the people.  A village nucleus is one where if there were a shop, a pub or a church, planning permission would be allowed around them thereby building a community.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>If people mention that now, they are thought to be off their rocker because it is rural Ireland and people cannot build a house in rural Ireland anymore due to all these dreamed-up scenic landscapes and other nonsensical rubbish.  It is not architectural or percolation issues, which have to be adhered to, but nonsensical rubbish.  That is all it is - some collar-and-tie pencil pusher dreaming up ideas to ensure that nobody gets to live in a rural community and nobody can build a rural community.  We have the facilities and the capabilities, be it in west Cork or any other county in Ireland, to help solve, not fully solve, this problem.<\/p> <p> There is another issue.  In the towns and villages of west Cork there are many derelict houses.  There must a serious focus on over-the-shop living or something along that line, with proper funding made available.  There are fabulous community centres and massive, brilliant schools in west Cork.  There are fabulous facilities in the towns and villages for young people who are struggling to survive in the cities.  They could have a good and healthy lifestyle.  We blame Covid-19 for not being able to build houses all along.  However, it has not happened.  I keep referring to the 40,000 houses dream that the T&aacute;naiste woke up to one morning.  That is not going to happen either.  We know that, and it is scandalous that national broadcasters would give somebody so much air time to talk so much rubbish.  Is there nobody there to say: \"Hang on a minute, what are you talking about?  That is not going to happen and you know it is not going to happen\"?<\/p> <p> I want to return to the issue of people who look for planning permission.  I am very focused on that and I believe it will be the subject of the next big protest that will happen in this country.  We are inundated with people in my county who are continually being refused permission.  We need to drop this carry-on about having to have a connection to the area.  Of course, if somebody is looking for planning permission, the person obviously has to prove he or she has a job there.  Surely to God that is good enough to give the person planning permission.  The person does not have to be living so many kilometres from the site.  The person should not have to prove he or she cannot live there because it is a scenic landscape.  We are forcing people into a situation.  I see it when I go to clinics in Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen and Bantry.  They are no-go areas for housing.  It is a struggle both mentally and physically for people.  I have had people crying their eyes out in my office, as I am sure other Deputies have had, asking why I cannot get them a house.  I had somebody on the telephone today threatening to put me on the radio because I could not get the person a house.  What can I do?  I do not have them in the boot of the car.  The T&aacute;naiste must have plenty of them, but I do not.<\/p> <p> Will the Minister work with the rural communities to create a solution, regardless of whether it is in this legislation or in future legislation, with regard to planning permission and rural living in towns and villages?  There is a solution there.  It is not a magic wand and it will not cure all, but it is certainly well worth exploring.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000066#VVV00400","speaker":"1461","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625078520,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I support these amendments.  They go to the heart of the issue.  I acknowledge that the Minister has moved some way in respect of 100% public homes on public land, but that is not guaranteed.  It is as if he is taking baby steps forward.  We, and particularly my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, have been putting forward solutions to tackle the housing crisis.  In this Bill, it appears that the Minister has taken a small amount of Deputy &Oacute; Broin's proposals on board, but we invite the Minister to look at our strategy because, ultimately, the housing crisis affects every community and we must work together.<\/p>  <p>  I hear talk about local authorities setting targets and local authorities doing more.  Let us be very clear here.  Previous Ministers and the Department have driven local authorities out of house building by cutting their staff and their funding and by not resourcing them to build homes.  Will this Minister commit to giving local authorities funding so they can have their own direct builds?  I welcome the fact that local authorities are hiring private developers to build developments, but local authorities are also buying developments that private developers have built separately.  There are big issues here.  Deputy McAuliffe spoke earlier about infrastructure.  We are also looking at the types of houses being built.  Are we building houses that are of universal design so they can be used by people with disabilities and older people?  Are we building one- and two-bedroom homes?  Are we building four- or five-bedroom homes?  What we need is a plan.  Just using the private sector, which appears to be Fianna F&aacute;il's and Fine Gael's mantra, does not work.<\/p>  <p>  With hindsight, when the Minister and his Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies sit down and consider the four years they supported Fine Gael in government, do they regret allowing Fine Gael to make the housing crisis worse when its Minister was responsible for housing?  Deputy McAuliffe and the Minister spoke earlier, but it must be remembered that they supported Fine Gael driving us into the worst housing crisis ever.  To explain how bad things are, this week reports have emerged which show that house prices in Munster have risen by 16%.  That is under the Minister's watch because it was Fianna F&aacute;il who supported Fine Gael.  We hear the T&aacute;naiste talking about building 40,000 houses.  He should hang his head in shame.  He was the Taoiseach and he did not deliver.<\/p>  <p>  I wish to make a few more points.  I want to see local authorities build houses, buy houses and have a combination of direct build and using private developers, but to build the developments that local authorities need, not what private developers want to build.  We are committed to having 100% public housing on public lands.  That is the fundamental difference between us and what is in this Bill.  The Bill does not guarantee that.<\/p>  <p>  The other issue is affordability.  When the Government looks at affordability, it looks at a reduction related to the market price.  We believe affordability should be based on income and what people can afford to pay, not inflated market prices to tell us what the reduction should be and deem that affordable.  That is not affordable.  When I was a member of Cork City Council, I, other Sinn F&eacute;in councillors, Independent councillors and councillors from left-wing parties put forward solutions to resolve the housing crisis in Cork.  As I stand here speaking on housing, I can say that the housing crisis has never been worse than it is tonight.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been in government for decades and they must accept responsibility for that.<\/p>  <p>  A lady contacted me yesterday.  She and her partner have been on the social housing list for eight and a half years.  She was taken off the housing list this week because she is over the income threshold.  Her partner is in the Defence Forces.  She works for 12 hours per week.  How is it possible under this Government that a family with one full-time income cannot qualify for social housing?  They cannot get a mortgage from the banks.  This family is now left in limbo.  If their housing assistance payment, HAP, is cut off, and it is currently under appeal, they will have to come up with a rent payment of &euro;1,400 per month.  I was discussing with the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, the salaries and income of members of the Defence Forces.  There is no way an ordinary member of the Defence Forces could come up with &euro;1,400 per month for rent.  That is under the Government's watch as well.<\/p>  <p>  We want solutions.  We recognise that the Minister has taken baby steps forward here, but it must be much more dynamic.  We need to look further and deeper to see how we can solve the housing crisis.  I will leave the Minister with three simple things if he really wishes to solve the housing crisis as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>What are we doing with derelict sites?  Tens of thousands of houses and sites are lying idle throughout the country and we are not tackling them.  There are 90,000 vacant properties not being tackled.  Where is the money required for the local authorities to compulsorily purchase these properties and to take the owners and landlords of derelict buildings and vacant sites to task?  If the Minister is serious, he will fund the local authorities to do this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000067#WWW00200","speaker":"1453","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625079120,"counter":474,"content":"<p>I am also glad to be able to address these amendments.  There is an ideological argument here about parties on the left and on the right.  The sad part about all this, however, is that there is a logjam in the delivery of housing.  Many parties have been involved.  When the Labour Party was in government, Deputy Kelly was the Minister responsible and he promised us more houses.  I told him then that he would not build a henhouse from Toomevara to Carrick-on-Suir, and he did not.  We must get real here.  I am not in favour of the Land Development Agency because we have had a bad experience with these big agencies.  We previously had the National Roads Authority, NRA, for instance, which is now Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  It is now necessary almost to get permission to pick a blackberry briar away from a sign.  It is just not possible to do it because these agencies are a law unto themselves.  I said many times, when Fred Barry was there, that we were able to decommission the IRA but we could not decommission the NRA.  Now, we have TII.  It is just impossible.<\/p><p>We also have the new Office of the Planning Regulator.  Why do we need that?  It is another person with a great deal of experience in planning, that is true.  I am sure he has an office in Dublin and perhaps a regional one as well, with brass plates on the door, fancy furniture and a team around him.  Our group of rural Independents will not meet him, but he wants to make himself feel relevant.  Big is not better, and an example of that is Irish Water.  When we had the group water schemes, the good men and women and council workers dug out those schemes with picks and shovels.  I remember going to help them out myself when I was a young man with a JCB, and such a machine was alien to them.  They were doing their work with picks and shovels and sweated blood to do it.  Now we have Irish Water, which does not even know where the towns are, let alone the pipes.<\/p><p>We must get rid of the existing logjams in this regard.  I worked with the Minister when we were in opposition and I have some faith in him.  We have all these agencies to get development, but it is not happening.  I was a board member of the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, for about ten years.  I was also the chair of a voluntary housing scheme and we built 17 houses.  We had a lovely team of volunteers and we built those houses.  It took the county council six years to build the same number of houses in the same field.  We built our houses in 15 months and we were told it could not be done.  There was not a professional person among us and we had to hire in any expertise.  We did have common sense, however.  The council houses were built with 11, 12 or 13 steps going up to them.  It is scandalous.  The houses we built were in the same field and do not have a step going up to them.  We have a flat complex.<\/p><p>Therefore, there are many issues.  I refer to bad management, inadequate training of senior officials in the council, reports and applications concerning building houses go up and come back down and six months later they go up again and the merry-go-round continues.  One application had to go to seven different offices throughout the country.<\/p><p>Turning to the issue of planning and rezoning, there is talk about having landbanks.  Perhaps it is fine for the cities but not for the rural areas.  People who want to build their own houses in rural Ireland are not being allowed to do so.  In addition, we have An Taisce, which is a prescribed body.  I ask the Minister to please derail, debunk and defund that body.  It has outlived its usefulness and it is a hindrance to people building houses now.  We had a meeting with the organisation, which was limited to an hour, unfortunately.  Our group was waiting for ages.  We want a follow-up meeting but we cannot get it.  An Taisce is just a menace.<\/p><p>I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, about Knocklofty House and hotel this evening.  It is a wonderful period house which is being ravaged and plundered and An Taisce does not even want to know about it.  Yet that body wants to stop people building houses in rural areas.  It also wants to stop, for ideological reasons, a wonderful cheese plant from being built in Kilkenny because that facility got planning permission, approval from an Bord Plean&aacute;la and an emissions licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  An Taisce, though, is taking a court case in regard to the facility, and it is doing that with taxpayers' money.  This would not happen in an asylum.  The taxpayers are funding An Taisce to the tune of &euro;6 million each year.  The organisation states that it does not use those funds for legal cases and that it gets all its barristers to work <i>pro bono<\/i>.  I do not know many barristers who work <i>pro bono<\/i>.  I have not met many of them anyway, so I doubt if they take cases to the High Court on that basis.  This is a rotten, stinking racket and it should be stopped.  These people must be removed from the equation and people should be allowed to build their own houses, within reasonable guidelines.<\/p><p>Moving on to zoning, and dezoning and the famous regulator, the Cahir town area plan was passed in recent months.  The residents of Mountain View Drive fought against it.  They have now been told that 60 ha of zoned land has gone down to 10 ha.  Hey presto, the council is coming along now.  I want social housing and council houses because we have a housing list as long as your arm in Tipperary, with 3,500 people on it.  Along with some farmers and landowners, I had been trying to get planning permission for a small development, a cluster of houses, a nursing home scheme and a retirement village, but the answer was &quot;No&quot;.  Nothing could happen unless Mountain View Drive had a new road.  That stipulation had been in a development plan, but now it has been removed.  The council has now stated it wants to build 43 under Part 8 on what are now playing pitches and a green area in a housing estate which is already densely populated.  Who is making these decisions?  There is a public meeting tomorrow night which I must attend and I have been invited to it.  The people are up in arms.  They made submissions to keep this green area and now the council is going to build on it, after it has dezoned 50 ha in the rest of the town.<\/p><p>Turning to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, I have a problem regarding masts for 5G.  Planning applications were submitted for one in Gortnahoe and another in New Inn, and there have been 120 and 86 objections respectively.  I refer to building on top of a person's home.  There is already an Eircom mast where the family of the late Jack Moloney gave the site free of choice, and the same happened in Gortnahoe, to the forerunner of Eircom, the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs, to get telephone lines to people.  They were great people.  Now, however, poles with masts on them have been put up.  The company wants to erect masts that are 25 m and 30 m high to put all the antennas it wants on them.  The council will probably refuse permission in this regard, and many such applications have been refused around the country.<\/p><p>I am told by activists, however, that 80% of those refusals of planning permission are being overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Does it care about the health of people, the visual intrusion, the Tidy Towns competition and the aesthetics?  The proposed mast in New Inn is near four listed properties.  I have again contacted An Taisce.  We must remember these requests for planning permission must, by statute, be sent to An Taisce.  The body was told about this matter via correspondence and the response was to offer thanks for being made aware of the situation.  It was not interested, though, in people's livelihoods or health or in small villages and communities.  It is interested in the nice dandy stuff, though, such as stopping factories and having all these meetings on ecology and climate change.  This is scandalous blackguarding.  I wish the Minister well, but none of these plans are going to happen unless he takes out all these logjams.  He must get rid of them.<\/p><p>It is necessary to deal with TII to come out from a site onto a regional road, for example.  I told the Minister that we decommissioned the IRA.  I refer to the work of the late Fr. Alex Reid, Dr. Martin Mansergh, Bertie Ahern and others in that regard.  We are left though with the NRA, which is now the TII.  These are just self-empowered people who are answerable to no one.  They are not accountable to this House, to the county councils or to anyone.  By hell, we are not to question them.  Those people are above that.  They are like the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, that we have now, in that they are untouchable.  We have really undermined our democracy and vested power in these people.  They should not have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000068#XXX00200","speaker":"1612"},{"type":"speech","time":1625079120,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for reminding me that An Taisce is a prescribed body in respect of planning regulations.  It would be a good move for the Land Development Agency to also become a prescribed body to enable it to be made aware of the submission of planning applications which may border or impact public lands.  It is something I will discuss with the Minister, and it is an aspect which may be introduced under planning rather than within the remit of this Bill.<\/p>  <p>  I will not be supporting the amendments put forward, but I thank the Deputies for giving us the opportunity to discuss further the Land Development Agency Bill 2021.  It is important we listen to the Opposition and that we listen to all sides of a discussion.  However, I have heard nothing here this evening to convince me other than that this legislation is one of the most significant and important housing Bills we have seen in a long time.  Coupled with the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which I hope to see passed shortly, these will be two major Bills which will deliver affordable housing at scale.  It is a challenge and it will not happen overnight, despite claims from many in the Opposition that they can deliver houses and magic them up out of nowhere.  This will take time and proper Bills, such as this one, must be passed to empower and enable us to do this.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the Minister and his Department for the incredible amount of legislation being produced.  I refer not just to housing but also the discussion we had yesterday in respect of flexibility concerning the planning process to enable us to make the changes as we see fit in the context of the impact of Covid-19.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Noonan and Peter Burke, attended the Committee Stage of this Bill.<\/p> <p>We had 269 amendments and every single one was addressed by the Minister or the Ministers of State.  Any amount of time was given to Deputies who appeared at that committee and I thank the Minister for that.  I also acknowledge that the Minister took on board a number of amendments and agreed to come back on Report Stage with changes.  I thank him for doing that.  <\/p> <p> The LDA vision is for cost rental housing at scale and we know that because the LDA appeared before the committee to discuss the Affordable Housing Bill at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  We know the objectives of the LDA.  The Green Party has been calling for the delivery of cost rental accommodation for a very long time and for the establishment of an agency such as the LDA.  It is not just the Green Party that has called for it.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, issued a report, No. 150, on housing policy which called for the establishment of the LDA on a statutory footing as a matter of urgency with an enhanced mandate to provide land for social housing.  It said that the agency should be equipped with a planning role and given the tools to assemble land.  It should also be given the land management expertise required for complex, large-scale building projects to engage in direct development, including through compulsory purchase orders, CPO.  I heard the CPO powers being criticised this evening but the CPO powers given to the LDA will be quite adequate.  Often the threat of CPO is all that is needed, rather than having to go down that route which can take a long time.  The LDA will also be tooled up to engage in master planning and the land value capture that is needed.  This is the view of NESC, which is a very respected think tank in this country.  It has produced some really significant and important reports over the years.  It talks about creating specialist teams to assist local authorities to undertake the necessary complex tasks around unlocking land and sites.  That is exactly what this Bill does and it brings about the urgency that NESC talked about.  NESC also talked about establishing a cost rental programme at scale, to ensure access to land at favourable terms and homes and rents that are affordable.  The LDA is focused on that and it told us so at the committee.  <\/p> <p> In terms of its objectives, the LDA is also tasked with creating sustainable and well-planned communities.  It will be able to operate at such scale and vision that it will be able to pull together developments.  Often what we see in the planning system is isolated developments with no cohesion between them.  That is all the planners can judge because we lack county architects to bring that together.  The LDA will be able to operate at that scale with that architectural vision of how places should develop and the linkage between communities.  The focus is not on isolated, high-density communities but on building homes and not just houses.  That is critically important.<\/p> <p> Significant funding has been put in place for the LDA and the Minister has indicated that funding will increase further in order to develop affordable, social and cost rental housing.  We need to match that housing funding with transport services.  It is no longer acceptable for large-scale developments to indicate that public transport is \"nearby\" or that a development is \"served\" by public transport.  That transport must be reliable, high frequency, comfortable and affordable.  We need to see a commensurate increase in funding for public transport as we have seen for housing.  <\/p> <p> We also need to see the creation of public open spaces; amenity spaces that people can enjoy.  If one looks at the European model of high-density developments, one always sees public open spaces that are well managed.  High density development requires that and the LDA will focus on it.  It was stated by Deputy &Oacute; Broin during the Committee Stage debate, which I chaired over seven sessions, that we should \"direct the LDA\", or words to that effect, away from residential development.  That is the most incredible statement for an Opposition housing spokesperson to make, that we should direct the LDA away from creating residential development.  It was an incredible statement and I hope Deputy &Oacute; Broin gets the opportunity to elaborate on it.  We have seen Sinn F&eacute;in members on various councils objecting to housing.  The Opposition is concerned with this Bill not because there is anything wrong with it but because it is good legislation, as is the Affordable Housing Bill.  These two Bills will deliver housing.  This is the Government that will deliver housing at scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000068#XXX00300","speaker":"1626","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625079720,"counter":477,"content":"<p> I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on these Report Stage amendments.  I support the LDA because anything we can do to speed up the development of housing is welcome.  I ask the Minister to clarify a number of issues.  I have received a lot of phone calls today about stuff that is on Facebook and I ask the Minister to clarify matters on the record of the D&aacute;il.  It is being said that from next February in rural Ireland, if one's sole income is not from farming, one will not get planning permission.  I would like the Minister to confirm that this is not correct.  It is flying everywhere at the moment and rural Ireland must be thought about.<\/p>  <p>  The set up of the LDA is going to be vital.  I have said previously that I do not believe civil servants should be in it.  The Minister needs to bring in people from the private sector and I am on record as saying that.  It is not that I have anything against civil servants but we need people who have proven they can deliver.  I would have people on bonuses to deliver and not on salaries where it does not matter whether they deliver one or 101 houses.  <\/p>  <p>  Those in charge of the LDA and the Minister must do something to address the ferocious logjams that exist at the moment because of judicial reviews, with approximately 10,000 to 15,000 houses held up in Dublin.  An issue arose before the Minister's time related to architects.  An architects alliance was formed because people were pushed outside of the system, even though they have years of experience.  I ask the Minister to deal with them.  I understand the Department is trying to resolve the issues.  We need as many skilled people as we can get.  There is a scarcity of hands, of skilled people.  I urge the Minister to work on getting people to come back.  There are people in other countries that we need here.  They went to England when this country closed down.  I refer to digger drivers, pipe layers, plasterers, brick layers.  These are top-class, skilled people.  A few years ago the Minister for Health offered incentives to healthcare staff to come back to the country.  If one returns here from America or Australia, one cannot drive straight away.  There must be joined-up thinking on ways to make it easy and attractive for people to come back to this country.  We need to dangle some carrots, as well as making all of these other important things work.  In order to get to work in Ireland, one needs a car because it is not always feasible to travel by bus.  <\/p>  <p>  Someone must call a halt to housing bodies, local authorities and the LDA all bidding for the same parcel of land.  That cannot happen because if we keep at that, it is up that the price will go.  If there are 35,000 sites in this country that are owned by the State and we put roads, sewers and footpaths in and we fully service those sites, there might be a 5% to 10% difference between building a house in Dublin or in Galway but that is it.  An affordable three- or four-bedroom house is between &euro;200,000 and &euro;250,000 and not the figures I see printed everywhere at the moment.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this works.  In fairness, as the previous speaker said, a lot of legislation is being introduced.  However, the bottom line is that we must attract the skilled labour that we need.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste talking about 40,000 houses per annum and it would be mighty if we could get to that figure but at the moment one could wait six months to get a plumber in some rural areas.  We also need to tie in with the likes of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to address the class issues and the belief that brickies and plasterers did not spend very long in school.<\/p> <p>We must appreciate that those people who are able to use their hands in building are the most skilled people.  They are artists and we need to put them on a pedestal in the line of qualifications.  Once a year, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>or other newspapers detail what colleges students go to.  Someone can have all the brains in the world but if he or she is not able to use them they are not worth a damn to him or her.  These skilled people who can use their hands are as important to a country as any other person and if people cannot drive the digger, lay the pipe, plaster the house or lay the block, the steel structure for an office block or a roadway that can get the people who want to work into work, be it an accountant, a solicitor, or whomever, cannot be built.  We need to make sure we appreciate those people.  We also need to make sure that the cycles of bang and bust and high and low stop and that we try to do things on an even keel.<br\/><br\/>The Minister has a job ahead of him and I wish him the best of luck with it.  I hope this works out but the Government should not go down the route of the likes of Irish Water.  Irish Water needs more funding because it needs to plan ahead to put in the water and sewer infrastructure required for three, four or five years into the future.  This Government will be gone and another Government will enter office.  Regardless of who is in power then, Irish Water needs to be planning four, five and six years ahead for what will be needed for housing on sites.  If that is not done there will just be a complete bang.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000069#YYY00200","speaker":"1508","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625080320,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I have not moved amendment No. 13 yet but I might address some of the points raised on it and also address amendments Nos. 1 to 12.  Deputy Boyd Barrett moved all 12 of those amendments and I will address them first.  I thank Deputies for taking the time to table amendments and for a comprehensive debate, both on Second and Committee Stages.  As the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Matthews, mentioned, we went through 268 or 269 amendments and myself, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, addressed every one of them.<\/p>  <p>  There are still some fundamental differences of approach on the LDA.  That is why I could not accept the amendments to the Long Title that have been put forward in amendments Nos. 1 to 12.  I do not accept the narrative from some Opposition Deputies that there should be a land development agency that does not build any homes.  That is something that has been argued by the main Opposition spokesperson on housing.  I do not know whether Deputy Gould has argued that at all but, in general, we need our State-owned land to be utilised productively and we need an agency that will supplement and not supplant the local authorities.  I want the local authorities to be the main deliverers of local authority homes and social and affordable homes.  That is why I have provided them with more money this year than ever and I have asked them to go out and buy more land to deliver more.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to the points that have been raised.  There may have been an issue in that I made some changes to the Bill moving forward.  I acknowledge that Deputies in the opposition have also recognised that.  I have tried to take on board as many of the valid points that were made on Committee Stage by Members from all parties and none as possible to frame them into legislation that will work.  This is a cornerstone Bill that will be in place for years to come.  We need an agency that will deliver social and affordable homes, both for purchase and cost rental on State land.<\/p>  <p>  I refer to amendments Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, and then I will address No. 13 because it is important in the context of our discussions.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 12 are tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues in his grouping, including Deputy Barry.  I cannot accept the amendments, which seek to amend the Long Title to reflect other amendments tabled by the Deputies.  While I genuinely appreciate the consideration that they have given to this Bill and the detailed amendments they seek to bring, I cannot accept these amendments to the Long Title as they do not reflect the intent of the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to establish a land development agency and make appropriate arrangements for the utilisation of relevant public lands for housing.  That has to be the fundamental difference and if that is the difference between this Government and many of those in Opposition, I will take that every day of the week.  The idea that we would have an agency that does not build homes - and Deputy &Oacute; Broin went even further on Committee Stage and said that it should not even plan to build homes or masterplan - just beggars belief as the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Matthews, said earlier on.  Having said that, Deputy &Oacute; Broin is entitled to his view and I respect that while disagreeing with it.<\/p>  <p>  This Bill is not legislating for privately owned land.  Levies are in place to activate private and public lands, which can be improved upon, and I want to see that happen.  I will consider further measures as appropriate for private land activation.  When the State activates a lot of the idle land it has, it will have a dramatic effect.  We need to get on and get this agency up and running, get it capitalised and get it building.  It is not appropriate to include such references as are in the amendments in the legislation.<\/p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to increase the supply of housing, particularly affordable and social housing, by ensuring that public land that is not being utilised or that is underutilised is made available for housing.  That is a simple but important concept.  It also provides for the establishment of the LDA as a commercial semi-State body to deliver that housing.  It is wholly appropriate that the LDA will be established as a designated activity company under the Companies Act 2014.  This is in line with other commercial semi-State bodies that we all know.  The Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform will be the only shareholders.  This will ensure that this body is publicly owned.  Regardless of what some Opposition Deputies continue to say, this is a publicly owned, commercial semi-State body that will deliver homes on State-owned land.  It is necessary that the LDA has a shareholding as it facilitates &euro;1.25 billion in investment from the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  I have not heard anyone argue against that yet but that may come in time.<\/p>  <p>  Under the programme for Government, the LDA is being assigned a key role in housing delivery and will work as an additional resource providing services to assist local authorities in their core role as housing authorities.  The committee members may be tired of me saying this but I want to restate that the local authorities will deliver the vast majority of social and affordable homes in this country.  The LDA will activate other land that is not being used heretofore.  We have provided those local authorities with the funds to do so and we have provided the individual targets per local authority.  The LDA will also be a development authority for the relevant public lands and lands owned by the agency.  This is appropriate and is in line with the other State bodies that have a development role, such as IDA Ireland or the Grangegorman Development Agency, for example.  However, it will not have the full development agency role involving planning powers that the local authorities have and appropriately so.  I respectfully state that I cannot accept amendments Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, and I will address amendment No. 13 when I move that.  I thank the Deputies for tabling their amendments and I hope I have addressed them as best I can.<\/p>  <p>  There were many other points raised and it is not that I am ignoring them but they were not relevant to these amendments.  I am happy to discuss rural planning, wastewater treatment and the lack thereof and various other issues that we can address on another day.  I have noted the Deputies' comments in that regard but I have not been able to address them in the short amount of time I have while speaking to these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000070#ZZZ00200","speaker":"1561"},{"type":"speech","time":1625080320,"counter":480,"content":"<p>As the mover of most of the amendments in this group, I will respond to the Minister.

What is the problem we have to fix?  Is it that local authorities just did not bother to build council housing for the past 20 years or is it that central government did not give them the money and support to do it?  The answer is the latter.  The councils and elected councillors knew and were pushing all the time.  I did nothing else before I was a councillor, when I was a councillor and now as a Deputy other than constantly campaign for council housing.  Central government would not provide the money to do it.  The Minister said the LDA is not going to usurp the role of local authorities.  The first development likely to be produced by the LDA, Shanganagh Castle, is in my constituency and should have been developed by the council a decade ago but central government did not give the council the money and the development has now been handed over to the LDA.  It has already usurped D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and, as a consequence, we do not know if the affordable housing built on the site will be genuinely affordable.<\/p> <p> I have only a few seconds left to speak to this group of amendments so I cannot elaborate the points.

For four decades, housing policy expert after housing policy expert has been calling for an active land management agency, a strong State agency with a significant budget and comprehensive CPO powers.  The job of that agency would be to amass land holdings and, working in partnership with the appropriate State agency, assist those being developed.  That is what we should be debating here today.  Unfortunately, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, as parts of government after government, have refused to do that.  The reasons are unclear but that is the central flaw of this Bill.  The problem is that because the Government is also ensuring that this land management agency, weak as it is, will also be a commercial residential developer, the LDA cannot have strong CPO powers, cannot be involved in active land management as is required in this State and therefore does not fulfil the central demand of the NESC for such an agency or for other agencies.<\/p>  <p>  This agency is usurping our local authorities because what we will see, as has happened in St. Teresa's Gardens in Dublin city, is that rather than funding a local authority to do a large social and affordable housing development, the responsibility will be transferred to the LDA.  In fact, all local authorities will be left doing is small volumes of social housing, nowhere close to the volumes that are needed, and affordable rental units and houses for affordable sale will be left to the LDA.<\/p>  <p>  The level of capitalisation the Minister is talking about is embarrassingly small.  Spending &euro;1.25 billion and borrowing another &euro;1.25 billion would not even be enough expenditure to deliver appropriate volumes of social and affordable housing in a single year, let alone over the lifetime of the Bill.  This Bill will not do what Deputy McAuliffe said it will do.  It is not going to provide the homes that people who vote for him, me, the Minister and others urgently require.  We will not see a single LDA home until 2023 and will not even hit 1,000 homes until after 2025.  That is the reason we are opposed to the Bill and we want the Government to stop talking about housing and fund our local authorities to build tens of thousands of social and affordable homes annually.

Without strong CPO powers to allow the LDA to buy land that would be suitable for housing but is, for example, zoned for agriculture at the moment, and without the opportunity to assemble that land bank, we will not have a sufficient pipeline of land at an affordable rate which then brings down the cost of delivery to ensure we can provide affordable homes for purchase and cost rental.

Deputy Boyd Barrett did and I am addressing those amendments.  I have addressed in some detail why I will not accept them.  I say to Deputy Boyd Barrett, however, that there is a fundamental difference.  I want a Land Development Agency that builds and plans to build homes on State-owned land.  It will not usurp the local authority.  The Deputy made reference to Shanganagh, which will deliver hundreds of homes.  This is where Deputy Boyd Barrett's local authority is working in partnership with the Land Development Agency.  No land was transferred over to it in that; it is a partnership approach.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan raised a good point, which needs to be addressed.  He made a reasonable point, unlike some others that have been made, with regard to land assembly.  I remind Deputy O'Callaghan that any State agency that sells land will have to offer that to the Land Development Agency first.  I want the LDA to get on with and deliver on the initial nine sites it has.  Before this year is out, however, I would expect it to have significantly more land to develop.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I will respond to a comment made by the main Opposition spokesman on housing, who bemoaned the fact there will only be &euro;1.25 billion worth of Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, funding plus an equivalent in borrowing of &euro;1.25 billion.

We welcome the fact that the reference to market price, which was one of our amendments, has been removed.  Then, however, it refers it on to the Affordable Housing Bill, in which there is no clear definition that ensures \"affordable\" will genuinely be affordable in terms of rent or affordable purchase based on people's income.  Instead, it will be specified by the Minister and references to market price, market conditions, and indeed, local market conditions still continue to litter the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In the one minute and 40 seconds I have left to speak to eight or nine amendments, I must correct a factually terribly important point made by Deputy Duffy about the Minister's commitment.  Deputy Duffy is correct.  The Minister made a commitment on Committee Stage that LDA sites in Dublin and Cork would develop exclusively 100% public and affordable housing as we, Deputy Duffy and others asked for in amendments.  The Minister did not follow through on that commitment and it is not in this Bill.  I will quote the section if the Minister wants.  Amendment No. 120 is the Minister's and amendment No. 122 also relates to it.  He said that in areas with a population of more than 150,000 people, he may prescribe up to 80%, which, when one takes in the Part 5 and Part 10, means it is possible that it could be 100% public and affordable but he can equally do far less than that.  There is absolutely no hardwired obligation to deliver exclusively public and affordable housing on public land and that is our fundamental problem.  By the way, the issue of a land assembly or land development is in the next grouping, not in this one.  In this grouping, we are saying that the exclusive objective of the Land Development Agency should be to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing.<\/p><p><i>10 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>In this amendment, we are saying that the exclusive objective of the Land Development Agency should be to deliver public and genuinely affordable housing.

We discussed much of this subject matter in the previous, more general, discussion, which concerned the Title, but this is the group of amendments dealing with us setting out the alternative approach that we feel should have been pursued with the Land Development Agency.  This is to make it a land assembly agency that could create a pipeline of land necessary in order to ensure the supply of public and affordable housing by local authorities primarily, approved housing bodies and not-for-profit bodies.  It would leave the development of those lands to local authorities and, in an important point, prevent the Land Development Agency from essentially operating as a commercial entity.<\/p>  <p>  This speaks to a major concern that we have about the conception that the Government has about the Land Development Agency.  I remember the debates about the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, what the agency would achieve and why it was such a good idea.  As time went on, it became increasingly apparent that NAMA had a problem with delivery.  Some of us did not like the idea of NAMA in the first place but we thought it could and should have helped to deliver public and affordable housing in its large property portfolio.  When representatives of NAMA came before the finance committee, they used to say, basically, that was not their mandate.  It may have been a subsidiary objective way down its list of priorities to identify some houses for public housing and in the end only approximately 2,000 properties were transferred to local authorities.<\/p>  <p>  By and large, NAMA's mandate was set from the outset and it was to recover the money put into it.  Therefore, it had an interest in reinflating the property market.  The consequence of that has turned out to be quite disastrous.  NAMA can now turn around and say it has generated so many billions of euro, with a surplus over and above what was projected.  Taking this in the round, however, what has the consequence been?  Much of the land it disposed of has been handed over to private agents with no interest whatever in developing the public and affordable housing we need but they have played a very significant part in driving up the cost of housing to the current unaffordable levels.  That was hardwired into the mandate set down in the first place and to my mind there is a similar problem with the Land Development Agency.  What goes into or does not go into the legislation will, essentially, determine the outcome of the Land Development Agency.<\/p>  <p>  This relates to the debate we had earlier about the guillotine and so on.  Deputy McAuliffe has said we discussed these matters on Committee Stage and it therefore does not matter that there is a guillotine on Report Stage.  I am sorry but there is a legislative process.  The entire point of the discussion on Committee Stage is to take on board each other's points about amendments and different sections in the Bill before formulating further amendments on Report Stage based on that discussion.  Most of our amendments will not be reached, although all the Minister's amendments will be accepted once the guillotine comes down.  That is truth.  Some of the key matters that should be scrutinised will not be examined.<\/p>  <p>  Many of us want to ring the alarm bells about this.  There has not been enough digging into the detail in public discourse and debate on this.  We did this on Committee Stage to some degree but to be honest there is still much confusion about what the Land Development Agency is going to do.  One of our key concerns, which some of the amendments are trying to nullify, is the possibility that the Land Development Agency will engage in commercial activities.  That is not its job but the legislation allows it to do it.  It is just like NAMA ended up essentially operating as a sort of business that was trying to recover its investment and generate a surplus, despite that having quite dire consequences in the wider housing market.  It essentially handed back control of the land bank suitable for development of houses to the big investment funds that bought up all those portfolios from NAMA.<\/p>  <p>  This group of amendments also requires that the purpose of the Bill is to deliver solely public and affordable housing, limiting the role of the agency to making land available to local authorities in order that they can provide public and affordable housing.  The amendments would ensure the LDA will be fully publicly owned and controlled.  Currently it would be publicly owned but not publicly controlled.  The problem with many quangos is they are publicly owned but not publicly controlled.<\/p>  <p>  There are questions of commercial sensitivity because of deals with private finance and so on and we cannot find out what is being done when such bodies operate to a different set of objectives and priorities to what might be set by local authorities or communities according to their needs.  They are always looking to the deals being done with private finance, which completely distort what the objectives of such an agency should be.  This moves the purpose of a body like this away from what it could and should be doing, which is to aggressively assemble the land we need and servicing local authorities in delivering public housing, as they have always done in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000075#EEEE00400","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083020,"counter":571,"content":"<p>We are happy to support this group of amendments.  It seems to me from listening to a number of Government backbenchers that they just do not understand the reason we need an active land management agency, despite the fact that for 40 years, report after report, including Government reports, have explained why it is needed.  Unless there is an active land management agency whose sole function is in the public interest to acquire strategically important pieces of land, either from other State agencies who are not using it or are not using it for the correct purpose or from private interests, how can we ensure that land can be transferred to the relevant State agency for development?  That may be IDA Ireland for industrial development or local authorities for residential development.<\/p>  <p>  It is not the case, as one Government backbencher has said, that the compulsory purchase order powers in this Bill are adequate.  They are not.  The only compulsory purchase order power in this Bill is for ransom strips, which are small strips of land that the LDA will need to get access to its own sites and for the purposes of servicing.  One of the crucial powers of an active land management agency - comprehensive compulsory purchase order powers to ensure every bit of misused strategically important land is put to a proper purpose - is absent from the Bill.  It is a simple statement of fact.<\/p>  <p>  Why is the Bill constructed in this way?  If an active land management agency was to be created properly with strong compulsory purchase order powers and a strong budget, it would be able to force other public agencies or private interests to release land.  For example, Donnybrook bus garage or the Pearse Street bus station could be acquired for proper mixed-use, residential and amenity development.<\/p> <p>Privately owned land that is hoarded and underdeveloped could be acquired if necessary.  Because the Government has not done that, it means those agencies such as our local authorities that are better placed to plan and to develop will be sidelined once again, as they have been for the past four decades by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.<\/p> <p> There is a consequence to that.  Government Ministers and backbenchers keep talking about delivering affordable homes but the consequences of going down the route of a publicly owned commercial residential developer will be higher development costs.  Land would have to be acquired at above existing use value.  Yes, there would be some discounting of that existing use if it has a mixture of social and affordable, but it will be more expensive to acquire than an at existing use value.  Because the Government is underfunding the Land Development Agency, LDA,  it is going to have to go out to secure additional private equity and private finance.  There is no other way of it meeting anything close to the targets the previous Government set for it.  That would push up development costs.  This is why on the first LDA-led project, which is Shanganagh Castle, we do not know what the purchase price of the affordable homes will be.  I suspect they will not be affordable.  This means the Government would have to put in a serviced sites fund to bring the prices down, or they will be sold as the so-called affordable homes in O'Devaney Gardens at &euro;310,000, plus a &euro;50,000 equity stake that has to be returned to the State.  I put it to the Minister that &euro;360,000 is not affordable.  This is why the affordable rents in the Shanganagh Castle development will not be affordable for key cohorts of people who need them: those households whose income is just above the thresholds for social housing and who need rents at below &euro;1,000, preferably between &euro;700 and &euro;900 per month.  Instead, their rents will be &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,300 per month.<\/p> <p> The way this legislation is constructed will not only undermine the active land management function, which we need, it will lead to a development model that is primarily commercialised, albeit publicly owned, pushing up development costs and making these homes unaffordable to many of the people who need them.  This is why the Bill is fundamentally flawed.  I make no apology for not wanting a centralised State agency to deliver homes commercially or to be involved in planning.  It has no purpose doing that.  We have local authorities.  They have statutory responsibility for housing and planning.  They have the skills and the ability, notwithstanding the asset stripping by previous governments.  If the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was really serious about delivering the tens of thousands of affordable homes annually that the State needs, he would not be wasting his time with this legislation.  The Minister would be doubling direct capital investment by the State and ensuring local authorities have the funding to deliver the 20,000 public homes a year he promised during the general election but which he then very quickly abandoned when he realised the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was controlling the purse strings and he was never going to get the money.  Local authorities should plan and deliver, and the Land Development Agency should assemble land and ensure local authorities have a sufficient supply of land into the future.<\/p> <p> I will raise another genuinely concerning point.  A lot of our talk has rightly been about affordable housing, and that is not a problem, but I am really worried that delivery of social housing would be far too small on the sites that were not originally local authority sites.  The Government keeps talking about this in the context of Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  In general, the non-local authority sites are likely to have only 10% social housing.  That would be an enormous mistake at a time when the current output of social housing is way below the level that is needed, even if targets set by Government are met.<\/p> <p> I will conclude on the issue of amendments.  We spent 14 hours in seven committee sessions.  I thank the Minister, the committee clerk, the Chairman, and the officials in the Bills Office and the Department for this.  The Minister will be aware Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled more amendments to this Bill than anyone else, at almost 170 amendments.  I took a decision, which was the right decision, not to table amendments on Report Stage, in part because the Minister had given a commitment to look at amendments and come back.  Unfortunately, we will not get to discuss some of those today but I acknowledge that.  Make no mistake, this Bill is not over.  There is another round of the legislative process in the Seanad.  We will table other amendments on that small number of core issues we believe the Bill still does not address.  I will be very clear: this is flawed legislation.  It is a bad idea for this kind of agency.  It will not do what the Government is saying it will do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000075#EEEE00500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":573,"content":"<p>The time is up Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00200","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":574,"content":"<p>My big fear is that, just like NAMA, in years to come-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00300","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":575,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00400","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":576,"content":"<p>-----we will be sitting at a Committee of Public Accounts with serious controversies-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00500","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":577,"content":"<p>There is a time pressure now, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00600","speaker":"1490"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":578,"content":"<p>-----because of the bad way this was developed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00700","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1625083620,"counter":579,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  He and his officials have produced very important and stellar legislation which I believe will stand the test of time.  I thank the committee, chaired by Deputy Matthews of my party and whose office is down from mine in Leinster House.  I have seen his dedication and hard work on this over recent months.<\/p>  <p>  In this debate so far we have not touched on one of the more important reasons we would have a Land Development Agency as conceived by this legislation.  At the outset of this Government 12 months ago, the Taoiseach said the three priorities of Government would be health, housing and climate.  We are in danger of looking at these three issues in a very siloed way, but in reality they are very connected.  I will draw a link between this Bill and climate, which is my own particular interest, and I chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  The Minister will be aware we have gone through some significant work in recent months.  We expect that the climate Bill will pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas and into law in the next few weeks.  Housing and climate cannot be separated.  Housing as it is currently configured in Ireland is very linked to our greenhouse gas emissions.  We have a commitment in the programme for Government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7% per year, which is about 51% through to 2030 and down to net zero by 2050.<\/p>  <p>  In my committee we did a series of sessions in recent months on transport emissions, which are generated by bad planning and by putting houses, commercial developments and office developments far away from each other such that people need to drive.  The LDA recognises this and the importance of good planning and good spatial development so that we do not need to depend on the private car and we do not need to generate greenhouse gas emissions.  It is a very significant step in Irish planning and in governance that we now have a national agency that will embrace the concept of compact growth such as the 15-minute city and the ten-minute town.  These concepts are critical to the development of our society as we go forward.<\/p>  <p>  In my city of Limerick, the LDA has engaged on a significant piece of work to develop high-density, high-quality, housing on the Colbert Station lands, which are very near the city centre.  It is about 50 acres of land.  We believe the development of these lands will significantly enhance Limerick city and make it a sustainable city environmentally and economically.  It will lead to Limerick thriving in the decades to come.<\/p>  <p>  Transit oriented development has been championed by the LDA and its former chairman, Mr. John Moran.<\/p> <p>It is the idea that housing is developed around transport nodes in a high-density but high-quality way, which is family oriented and connected to amenities and all that towns and cities have in their condensed nature.  This is critical and it marks a step change in how we do housing in Ireland.  I look forward to the LDA continuing its work and embracing those ideas in the years to come.  What we will see, and what the Bill will underpin, is a new way forward in how we develop housing in Ireland in an economically and environmentally sustainable way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000076#FFFF00800","speaker":"1594","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1625084220,"counter":581,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute.

It can no longer be the excuse for why we have to condense such important debates into such a short time window.<\/p>  <p>  I thank the committee Chairman and members for allowing me to move my amendments and speak to them on Committee Stage.  None of the amendments tabled by the Opposition were accepted.  We had 14 hours of debate on Committee Stage and we have three hours today.  The Bill has not developed or moved forward in any way or evolved in any significant way for us.  We supported it on Second Stage, as the Minister will be aware, because we agree with the concept of a land development agency but for us not enough has been done to protect public lands.  Yesterday, we spoke about how important the role of councillors is in our local democracy and how we need to strengthen their role.  The Bill does not do this.  The LDA is not accountable to the Oireachtas.  There is no guarantee the homes that ultimately will be built will be affordable.  The Labour Party will not support the Bill for these reasons and because of how the debate has carried on during Report Stage and particularly on Committee Stage.  I will leave it there.

To be fair, I acknowledge that a small number of amendments are being addressed by the Minister.  Many of the substantive issues we have raised are not being addressed and this is of significant concern to us.  One of the areas in which the Minister was very strong on Committee Stage, and in his comments in public and in the media, is that he gave a very clear commitment that on Report Stage he would bring an absolute guarantee that 100% of the LDA homes in the large urban centres would be social, affordable and cost rental and that the guarantee would be in the legislation.  The guarantee is not in the Bill.  The legislation allows for it to happen but it does not guarantee that it will.  This is a major weakness and flaw, and a major climbdown from what the Minister committed to.  Why has he not provided the guarantee when he was so clear there would be an absolute guarantee in the Bill?  This is a key point.  If he is not able to deliver on his guarantee in the legislation, it calls into question the guarantee he has given.  We need to know why, when he was so clear, is it not guaranteed in the Bill.<\/p>  <p>  In any event, all housing on public land should be 100% social, cost rental and affordable purchase.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin as I also have concerns and they are reflected in the amendments I have tabled on Committee and Report Stages.  I have concerns that potentially there will be a small delivery of social homes on these LDA lands, particularly given the context that until quite recently we saw 100% of public land used for social homes.  The fact there could be a small enough percentage is very concerning.<\/p>  <p>  There is a major cost to the Bill not being focused on active land management.  For decades, housing in Ireland has been affected by land speculation, land hoarding, the drip-feed of homes and more expensive delivery of costly homes.  These will continue because the LDA will not have key powers of active land management.  This is in the context of having some of the highest house prices in Europe.  The failure to tackle land costs and land speculation is a flaw in the Bill and is concerning.  Another key flaw in the Bill is the concentration of multiple functions in one agency.  This will lead to accountability issues and problems.  This, combined with the absence of strategic land assembly on the scale it should be at, with strong compulsory purchasing powers, is a significant issue.<\/p>  <p>  There have been good contributions from Deputies on the importance of strategic land assembly, climate change, the 15-minute city, the importance of building sustainable communities and the importance of investing in infrastructure, cycling and public transport.  I agree with all of these comments.  They are all points well made.  The key problem with the Bill is that it does not provide a mechanism to capture the uplift in land value from rezoning and use it to invest in infrastructure and deliver affordability in homes.  That this is missing from the Bill is a massive failure in what we could do to address climate change by using the land value uplift to invest in sustainable transport.  This is a massive missed opportunity, considering the Green Party is an active part of the coalition government.  Because this mechanism is missing from the Bill, we will continue to do the opposite.  The public will continue to spend on infrastructure that does the opposite and confers land value uplift into the hands of private landowners and private land speculators, who then use the increase in land value to sell the land at a higher price so the homes are delivered at a higher cost.  This will add to our affordability problems.<\/p>  <p>  Other countries have figured out that we can capture uplift in land value if the land is subject to compulsory purchase at an early stage before it is zoned and the infrastructure and amenities are then put in.  This leads to better and more sustainable communities at a much more cost-effective level, rather than handing the value over to people who have contributed nothing but have been fortunate enough themselves to have had the resources or capital to buy land early in the process.  This is what the Bill is missing.  It is a massive public value that could be captured.  It would make a massive change in how land is assembled strategically in the long run.  It would deliver the type of affordability that we need in respect of affordable purchase and cost rental, and of delivering social homes.  It means we could deliver them at much more affordable rates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000077#GGGG00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1625084220,"counter":583,"content":"<p>We have four contributors offering and approximately 13 minutes remain.

The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has really taken the lead since he came into the Department.  Housing has floundered for far too long.  Fianna F&aacute;il in government always delivered on housing and I am glad to see the Minister again taking the front foot in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  There are a few important details in the Bill we need to focus on rather than the sideline issues presented tonight.  The salient points are that this will give a statutory basis to the Land Development Agency and give a positive State intervention in line with EU state funding rules.  Already work is under way on 4,000 homes.  That is important and this deals with towns with a population in excess of 10,000 people. <\/p>  <p>  Many of us in this D&aacute;il Chamber have come from council chambers where, in the past, votes were put before councillors.  I am glad to see there is an element in this Bill that bypasses, insofar as the Land Development Agency is concerned, those awkward votes in council chambers.  I am sure that will be welcomed by Sinn F&eacute;in because, although I am a Clare Deputy, I read the other day that in Dublin there would have been an extra 6,000 houses built were it not for the votes Sinn F&eacute;in councillors in Dublin have opposed.  This will get them out of that sticky wicket.<\/p>  <p>  Something I saw in my councillor years and could not believe was ransom strips, a little strip of 1 m ground at the end of a cul-de-sac.  Developers put it there with a little bit of a kerb and a little grass area.  To get in beyond it to bring services or build more houses required someone to pay a ransom, sometimes running to several hundred thousand euro - or even up to &euro;1 million in one case.  This brings in a compulsory purchase order, CPO, power in regard to that.  There should be no barrier to another phase of development.  Why should we put barriers or obstacles to people having homes?  This Bill is another measure that the Minister, his Department and the Government seeks to introduce to ensure there is a supply of housing for people, particularly young people, who desperately need to get on the property ladder.<\/p>  <p>  I am a Deputy for County Clare, living in the south of the county.  We are only a few miles from Limerick city and I offer a word of caution to the Minister and his Department.  Limerick City and County Council has had to regenerate three neighbourhoods because too much housing was put in one part of the city without the ancillary services and social services to back it up.  We have seen areas like the south side of Limerick regenerated.  We have to learn lessons from that.  We want to see quality housing, which is part of the ethos of the Department, backed up by good schools and community infrastructure.  That is the type of community building we want to see.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021063000078#HHHH00200","speaker":"1519"},{"type":"speech","time":1625084820,"counter":587,"content":"<p>I have concerns about the Land Development Agency and how it will work.  My concerns revolve around the fact that we expect it to be a panacea that will change everything in land development and getting land ready for housing.  The decision to bypass the local authorities is not a good one.  I say that because I see in my county that houses are being built by local authorities and social housing is being built.<\/p>  <p>  The most important thing I will say is that, with regard to making land available, a number of things have gone wrong.  Number one is that when we do county development plans and local area plans, we do not zone enough residential land.  We do it on a desktop study without knowing if the land is available, will ever become available, can be sold, is for sale or is landlocked.  I have seen all these situations where we zone land on a basis of projected growth.  <\/p>  <p>  I raise this idea of having dense development in our towns and cities.  We should learn the lessons of the past on that and not talk about building houses without building communities.  It is very important that the Land Development Agency, if it is to be charged with all that, is funded properly to do it all.  Alternatively, will it be like Irish Water?  That was put in place to provide water and waste water facilities and we now find it is an impediment to construction works going ahead because it is not properly funded.<\/p>  <p>  It is a serious issue we face and I do not believe the Land Development Agency will solve the problems.  I respect what the Minister is trying to do but I have concerns about the fact the local authorities are being bypassed.

It is important before the Bill is finalised to put on record the need for this agency to be established.  As Deputy Crowe said, many Members of this House came from councils and over the last decade in particular, so much land was discussed that was never developed by the local authorities for various reasons.  This changes that.<\/p><p>On Deputy Mattie McGrath's point earlier, there was a commitment that this legislation would be passed by the end of term.  The Minister is keeping that and it is right.  We have all said <i>ad nauseam <\/i>that housing is so important in this State and this will unlock and develop land we badly need.  The Minister and his officials have brought this legislation through the pre-legislative scrutiny stage at the housing committee.  It is important to see discussion among Deputies all across the House.  They have put forward ideas and suggestions on the LDA.<\/p><p>The objective of this Bill is to establish the LDA on a statutory footing.  That is an important principle and, while there have been previous attempts to establish it, this will put it in place and fund it.  Targeting large areas, Dublin and Cork in particular, for 100% public homes on public land is important.<\/p><p>Shanganagh in my area has been referenced.  We have more than 600 homes earmarked for that.  That was talked about for nearly a decade and is good to see this through the LDA and the Affordable Housing Bills being passed.  It is important we see progress being made on those sites and others.  We are not just talking about local authority land; we are also talking about other State land, as was referenced earlier.  That is an important point of this Bill.  Some agencies have large tracts of land, have no intention of developing them or have never looked at them for housing purposes.  The LDA will piece that together and deliver and increase housing, something I hope all Deputies want.  The public have demanded it in the last 12 months.  When the public was asked about it, housing was the key issue.  The Government is responding to it.  The Minister has worked extremely hard on it and for that I commend him.

At all times, he was courteous and took on board opinions.  That is reflected in many aspects of the legislation that will frame the LDA.<\/p>  <p>  The LDA is, as Deputy Canney said, not a panacea.  However, it is one in a suite of legislative tools the Minister is bringing before this House and, alongside the Affordable Housing Bill, will be a key plank in addressing the single biggest issue in this country at the moment, namely, affordable housing.  Many Deputies have said this will not work or do the things it says on the tin but if one speaks to executives and senior management in local authorities and city councils across the country they will say the one thing they needed to address the housing crisis was a land development agency.<\/p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p>  <p>It may not suit some people ideologically or suit the agendas of particular political parties, but this Bill has one aim, and it is not to further the needs and aspirations of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.

This comes on top of the largest investment in housing in the history of the State, as announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in budget 2021.<\/p><p>The LDA is our Government putting its money where its mouth is.  That is in stark contrast to Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the LDA.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not want even to try to amend the legislation.  It just wants to vote it down.  If you had been watching Sinn F&eacute;in in the Chamber over the past year, you would know this is not out of kilter or new.  In fact, blind opposition for opposition's sake is very much Sinn F&eacute;in's <i>modus operandi<\/i>, except, of course, if its members are asked for their opinion on the Special Criminal Court.  Then they go to ground and avoid having to make a tough call or a decision.  Well, you know what?  Making decisions are an important part of being in government.  Leading, including on initiatives, and compromising on your position to deliver for the common good is another part of life in government.
