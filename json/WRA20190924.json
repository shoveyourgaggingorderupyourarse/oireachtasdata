It is critically important that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times. The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  <\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that the basis for complaint pre-dated a number of significant Government initiatives. In relation to collective bargaining, the Government established an independent Public Service Pay Commission in 2016, to provide objective analysis and advice on the most appropriate pay levels for the public service, including the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Report of the Public Service Pay Commission, the Government initiated negotiations on an extension to the Lansdowne Road Agreement. The Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations were invited to the negotiations on the agreement which were held under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission. They were afforded equal standing to other public sector trade unions and representative associations during the negotiations. <\/p>  <p>  Both PDFORRA and RACO accepted the terms of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 which provides for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement, with the focus on the lower paid. The increases in pay are being implemented on a phased basis with the most recent increase being a 1.75% increases on annualised salaries with effect from 1 September 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2(3) of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, prohibits the Defence Forces representative associations from being associated with or affiliated to any trade union or any other body, without the consent of the Minister. <\/p>  <p>  To compensate for these limitations there are a range of statutory redress mechanisms available to serving members, including  redress of wrongs, a Defence Forces Ombudsman and a Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. <\/p>  <p>  The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force provides a formal mechanism for the Permanent Defence Force Representative Associations, that is PDFORRA and RACO, to engage with the Official side.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to commitments made under pay agreements, members of the Permanent Defence Force can make representations in relation to their pay and conditions of service through their representative bodies. <\/p>  <p>  In light of the many changes in the industrial relations landscape since the establishment of the scheme, I initiated a fundamental review of the scheme in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  While the majority of the recommendations arising from the review of the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the C&amp;A scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force, there are no recommendations relating to the amendment of Industrial Relations legislation. <\/p>  <p>  Instead, the Reviewer recommended that the Departmental and Representative sides agree a revised scheme implementing the recommendations in the Review. The reviewer recommended that the revised scheme be reviewed after a three-year period as this would afford the parties an opportunity to assess the schemes performance. The parties to the scheme are in the process of developing and agreeing a revised scheme. It is not intended to make any legislative amendment that will pre-empt the outcome of the revised scheme.   <\/p>  <p>  The terms of reference for the review included consideration of the findings of the European Committee of Social Rights in the case of the European Organisation of Military Associations (Euromil) v Ireland. One of the recommendations from that review was that the official side should, with the consent of the Minister, engage in discussions with the ICTU to explore the practicalities of a PDF representative association forming association\/affiliation with the ICTU, while giving due consideration to any likely conflict that might arise between such an arrangement and the obligations of military service.<\/p>  <p>  This is in the context of a statement which the European Committee of Social Rights took into consideration in their deliberations where EUROMIL claimed that ICTU had stated that PDFORRA could be affiliated to ICTU with whatever conditions the Government deemed necessary and that this remains the position of ICTU. <\/p>  <p>  I asked my officials to examine this matter further and in this regard Defence management (civil and military) have engaged in discussions with ICTU.<\/p>  <p>  Association with ICTU poses complex questions for the Defence Forces from a legal, operational and management perspective. The feasibility of association is the subject of ongoing discussion and engagement with ICTU. <\/p>  <p>  I have recently met both RACO and PDFORRA and this matter was discussed in the course of the meetings.  <\/p>  <p>  The implications of any possible decision around association or affiliation are being carefully considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":18,"content":"<p>Question No. 14 answered with Question No. 8.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":19,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA01800"},{"type":"question","counter":20,"qnumday":15,"qnumall":"[38422\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA01900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the estimated number of persons likely to leave the Defence Forces in 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1255","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":21,"content":"<p>As at 31st August 2019, 558 personnel had discharged from the Permanent Defence Force.  The term 'discharges' encompasses personnel who left for a variety of reasons including on age grounds, at end of contract and voluntary discharges and also includes a number of trainees who exited prior to completion of their initial training. There will be additional discharges in 2019 for various reasons and the majority of personnel who discharge do so prior to the mandatory retirement age and at a time of their own choosing.  <\/p>  <p>  In 2018 the overarching turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force was 8.1%.  While the overall average departure rate since 2002 is 6.3% this peaked in 2012 at 8.58%.  This departure rate, or turnover rate, is comparable to, and in some cases more favourable than, other military organisations worldwide. However, the overarching turnover level does not illustrate important underlying trends. As the rate of turnover within a military organisation can differ across functional areas, the impact of turnover can vary accordingly.  Headline turnover figures do not reflect this complexity.  <\/p>  <p>  The issue of a fluctuating high turnover rate is also a feature of other military organisations. <\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this does not detract from the Governments goal of restoring the Permanent Defence Force to a strength of 9,500 personnel and, in that regard, I have previously acknowledged that there are recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces which is reflective of the current buoyant economic environment and jobs market. <\/p>  <p>  I brought these issues to the attention of the Public Service Pay Commission and the recommendations contained in their recent report have been accepted by Government.

On 9th July last, the Government published the Brexit Contingency Action Plan Update. This reflects the extensive work which has taken place at EU level and on a whole-of-Government basis, including the Brexit Omnibus Act 2019, to prepare for a no deal Brexit.  It sets out the next steps to be taken between now and 31st October. <\/p>  <p>  While the UK's decision to leave the EU does not of itself give rise to additional border control requirements, it remains the Government&rsquo;s view that the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border is for the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop, to be ratified.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the avoidance of a hard border and Ireland and the EU are at one on this.  The Government is working closely with the European Commission to meet the shared twin objectives of protecting the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it, and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding physical infrastructure at the border. This work is looking at necessary checks to preserve Ireland&rsquo;s full participation in the Single Market and Customs Union.  <\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances, there are no plans for a new Army barracks in counties Cavan and Monaghan or the greater Border region. In terms of deployment of military personnel to the border, as I have said in the past, primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Accordingly, responsibility for the security aspect of border control rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while the Revenue Commissioners also have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate.<\/p>  <p>  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.

The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  <\/p>  <p>  Over the past number of years various representations have been received in my Department outlining the courage and bravery of \"A\" Company. All representations have been considered and responded to acknowledging their valiant actions while under siege in Jadotville.   <\/p>  <p>  A review was conducted in 2004 by military officers for the purpose of a broader examination of the Jadotville case. This Board recommended that the events of Jadotville and the contribution of the 35th Battalion be given recognition. In this context, a number of measures have taken place to honour and to commemorate the events at Jadotville and the very significant contribution of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and of the 35th Battalion, as a whole, to the UN Peace Support Mission in the Congo.<\/p>  <p>  Recognition of their contribution over the years include: <\/p>  <p>  A. A presentation of scrolls to \"A\" Company in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  B. Portraits of Lt Col McNamee (35th Battalion Commander) and Comdt Quinlan (Company Commander &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company) were commissioned in 2006. <\/p>  <p>  C. In July of 2010 the 50th anniversary of the first deployment to the Congo was commemorated in a highly publicised and well attended event in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel. <\/p>  <p>  D. A nominal roll of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, printed in copper, was affixed to the monument in Costume Barracks and was unveiled as part of the 50th Anniversary of the Jadotville affair in September 2011. <\/p>  <p>  E. On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company. This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognize the brave actions of these men.  <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, on 13th June 2017, the Government decided, as an exceptional step, to award a medal known as &ldquo;An Bonn Jadotville&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Jadotville Medal&rdquo; to each member of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company, 35th Infantry Battalion and to the family representatives of deceased members to give full and due recognition in honour of their courageous actions at the Siege of Jadotville.  This medal presentation ceremony took place on 2nd December 2017 in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  This location is considered the spiritual home of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and it is from here that &ldquo;A&rdquo; company assembled in advance of their fateful deployment to the Congo.   <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the events and happenings to date properly honour the collective bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company and full and due recognition has been afforded to them in their honour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA07100","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Strength","counter":73,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA07200"},{"type":"question","counter":74,"qnumday":38,"qnumall":"[38456\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA07300","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the extent to which the strength of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps remains sufficient to meet a situation emerging such as a natural disaster or international responsibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":75,"content":"<p>My priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is maintained to the greatest extent possible. <\/p>  <p>  The allocation of over &euro;1 billion for the Defence Sector for 2019 emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of personnel, the Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills and equipment.  The full spectrum of personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any emergencies that may arise.  Between 2016 and 2018 over 2,000 personnel were inducted into the Permanent Defence Force while, in February 2019, the largest ever cadet class in the history of the State was commissioned.  Nevertheless, I recognise that reaching a strength level of 9,500 personnel is a key challenge for the Defence Forces at present but I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the means to continue to carry out all of the roles assigned by Government.  <\/p>  <p>  At National level, representation of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning by both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, primary responsibility for responding to emergencies such as a natural disaster rests with three designated principal response agencies, namely, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the relevant Local Authority  and the Health Service Executive.  The Defence Forces provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or an emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority and Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) roles.  Major Emergency Plans have been developed by local and regional authorities and these Plans identify the procedures for requesting assistance from the Defence Forces.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of overseas, at present there are close to 680 members of the Defence Forces serving in missions worldwide. In planning and supporting overseas operations, the combined engagement of the Defence Forces and Departmental staff is an essential element in the effective management of deployments.  This includes reviewing potential operations, rotation planning, procurement planning and training.  My Department and the Defence Forces work together to ensure the maximisation of options available to Government to meets its international obligations and I am satisfied this will continue in furtherance of Ireland's foreign and defence policy objectives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400059#WRA07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of An Taoiseach","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB00300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Civil Service Staff Data","counter":77,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":78,"qnumday":39,"qnumall":"[38219\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of civil servants that have left and-or retired from his Department in the past ten years who were bound by a cooling-off period in respect of taking up new employment in the private sector by grade, year and sector the staff moved on to.","asker":"1226","askee":"1236"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":40,"qnumall":"[38220\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of civil servants that have left and-or retired from his Department in the past ten years who were not bound by a cooling-off period in respect of taking up new employment in the private sector by grade, year and sector the staff moved on to; and the reason for same.","asker":"1226","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Regulation of Lobbying Act was enacted in 2015.

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are considered in the context of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment priorities planning process.  The principal aim over the period of the White Paper will be to replace and upgrade, as required, existing capabilities in order to retain a flexible response for a wide range of operational requirements, including response to security risks and other emergencies, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The mid-life upgrade programme for the Army&rsquo;s fleet of eighty MOWAG Armoured Personnel Carriers will extend the utility of the fleet and provide greater levels of protection, mobility and firepower. Additionally, twenty-four 4 x 4 Armoured Utility Vehicles were acquired in 2017, and in 2018 delivery was taken of ten new armoured logistic vehicles. These measures will provide essential force protection overseas.<\/p>  <p>  There is also continuous investment in the non-armoured vehicle fleet. In 2018, 20 minibuses, 22 saloons, 61 logistics vehicles and 2 recovery vehicles were purchased for the Defence Forces,  and funding is provided on an on-going basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet, both at home and overseas.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is currently investing in updating the Air Corps fleet of aircraft with the replacement of the existing five Cessna aircraft with three larger and more capable fixed wing utility Pilatus PC 12 aircraft which are being equipped for ISTAR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance). It is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered by 2020. Planning is also in progress to replace the CASA Maritime Patrol aircraft and a tender competition is currently underway in this regard. <\/p>  <p>  The on-going Naval Service ship replacement programme is evidence of the Government's commitment to investment in the Naval Service. Three new Offshore Patrol Vessels were delivered between 2014 and 2017 with the fourth, the L&Eacute; George Bernard Shaw, delivered in late 2018.  In addition, planning is ongoing for the replacement of the current Naval Service flagship L&Eacute; Eithne with a multi role vessel. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to Defence Forces communications systems, there is continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.<\/p>  <p>  The examples given, whilst not exhaustive, demonstrate my commitment to update and upgrade the Defence Forces equipment and capability, within the financial envelope available. In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence was been increased to &euro;106 million for 2019, an increase of &euro;29 million. The National Development Plan provides for a total of &euro;541 million for Defence over the period 2018-2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years.<\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the necessary modern and effective range of equipment available to them, including vehicles and communication systems, which is in line with best international standards in order to fulfil all roles assigned to them by Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1365"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Defence Forces Personnel Data","counter":111,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB03600"},{"type":"question","counter":112,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[38906\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400060#WRB03700","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the number of women serving in each branch of the Defence Forces; the number that have resigned and-or retired; the extent to which they have been replaced; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":113,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is set out below:<\/p><p>Substantive strength of females in the Defence Forces as at 31 Aug 2019 -<\/p><p><table><tr><th><\/th><th><div> <b>Officers<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div> <b>NCOs<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div> <b>PTEs<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div> <b>Cadets<\/b><\/div><\/th><th><div> <b>TOTAL<\/b><\/div><\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>Army<\/b><\/td><td><div> 120<\/div><\/td><td><div> 163<\/div><\/td><td><div> 196<\/div><\/td><td><div> 9<\/div><\/td><td><div> <b>488<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b> Air Corps<\/b><\/td><td><div> 11<\/div><\/td><td><div> 15<\/div><\/td><td><div> 5<\/div><\/td><td><div> 1<\/div><\/td><td><div><b> 32<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Naval Service<\/b><\/td><td><div> 23<\/div><\/td><td><div> 13<\/div><\/td><td><div> 28<\/div><\/td><td><div> 2<\/div><\/td><td><div><b> 66<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b> TOTAL<\/b><\/td><td><div> <b>154<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div> <b>191<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div> <b>229<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div> <b>12<\/b><\/div><\/td><td><div> <b>586<\/b><\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.

The Group was established on foot of a Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council in 2014, led by a number of developing countries, including Ecuador and South Africa. Four sessions of the Group have taken place to date.  <\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding our serious concerns about the way in which its work has been conducted, Ireland is among those countries which favours participation in the annual sessions of the Inter-Governmental Working Group.  We also believe that all stakeholders, including civil society, trade unions and business, should be enabled to participate and are concerned by reports that they may be excluded from the next session which will take place in October in Geneva.  Ecuador has circulated a revised draft treaty in advance of this meeting which contains some positive developments compared to an earlier version presented in 2018.  At this stage it is foreseen that the EU will attend the forthcoming session and, while welcoming the improvements in the draft, will signal that it is not in a position to enter into detailed negotiations pending completion of a comprehensive analysis.  It is likely however that the EU will avail of the opportunity to pose a number of questions on issues of concern.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is open to looking at options for progress on a legally binding treaty.  With regard to its scope, we believe that all economic operators, whether transnational or purely domestic, should be treated in a non-discriminatory manner. We would also wish to see essential human rights principles reflected in any possible instrument, which should reaffirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights and stress the primary responsibility of States under existing human rights obligations to protect against human rights violations. <\/p>  <p>  Ultimately, if it is to achieve its objectives, any legally binding instrument should enjoy broad support among UN Member States to ensure its effectiveness as well as international coherence in the framework of business and human rights.  On this point, I would note that of the 22 countries which to date have adopted National Plans on Business and Human Rights, 16, including Ireland, are EU Member States.  We would like to see any new initiative build on, rather than duplicate, existing measures such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. Above all we believe that it should be rooted in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.  In this regard, we are of the view that the UN Working Party on Business and Human Rights and the annual UN Forum on Business and Human Rights provide appropriate fora for consideration of any new initiatives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":142,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01500"},{"type":"question","counter":143,"qnumday":63,"qnumall":"[38294\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the recent decision by India to revoke the autonomy of Kashmir; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":144,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[38295\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01700","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on reports that all communication including Internet and mobile phones have been cut off in Kashmir; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":145,"qnumday":65,"qnumall":"[38296\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the steps that have been taken at EU and international level to ensure that the fundamental human rights of Kashmiri people are being upheld; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":146,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[38297\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC01900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the response of the EU to recent developments in Kashmir; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":147,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 to 66, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware of the ongoing situation in Kashmir and my Department is monitoring developments closely.

A significant number of Rohingya civilians were also internally displaced within Rakhine and 128,000 people remain in IDP camps having fled previous bouts of violence. Recent months have again seen an escalation of violence in Rakhine State and neighbouring Chin State due to ongoing conflict between the Myanmar Security Forces and ethnic armed groups. The situation remains unstable with increasing violence generating further displacement of civilians.      <\/p>  <p>  Ireland, together with our EU and UN partners, has consistently called for the accountability of those who are responsible for such crimes and we continue to advocate for, and support, actions at international level to address this crisis.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has been at the forefront of the international response to the Rohingya crisis. Targeted restrictive measures have been put in place by the EU against senior military officers of the Myanmar Security Forces responsible for these acts and further measures are being kept under review. The EU Foreign Affairs Council has adopted a series of Council Conclusions addressing gross human rights violations in Myanmar&rsquo;s Rakhine, Kachin and Shan States. These conclusions press for Myanmar to hold those responsible for these crimes to account and to take meaningful action towards the creation of conditions conducive to a safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable return of those displaced to their places of origin. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the European Commission is currently reviewing Myanmar&rsquo;s trade preferences under the framework of the Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The EU has also worked with our international partners to press for action at UN level including acting as pen-holder on several key initiatives including the establishment of both the UNHRC mandated Independent International Fact-Finding Mission and the recently operational Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar.

The document has no legal value or authority over VAT legislation in place on 1 January 1991 or subsequently and has no legal effect. It does not mean that food supplement products were legally zero rated on 1 January 1991 or subsequently.<\/p><p>Irish VAT law does not provide a zero rate for food supplement products and under EU VAT law Ireland is precluded from introducing such a provision. A zero VAT rate for food and drink is provided for under a derogation from EU VAT law which allows Member States to retain certain zero rates for goods and services which were expressly covered in their national VAT legislation on 1 January 1991. The legislative provision for food and drink was in place on 1 January 1991; however, there was no legislative provision for food supplement products and therefore they cannot be legally zero rated.<\/p><p>Shortly after the introduction of VAT, Revenue allowed the zero rate to be applied to certain food supplement products (vitamins, minerals and fish oils). This concessionary approach expanded as the market developed over the years and resulted in the zero rating by Revenue of further similar products, including products other than vitamins, minerals and fish oils and references included on the VAT rates database and other information on the Revenue website simply reflected this practice. The evolution of the scope of the concessionary treatment of certain types of food supplement products was well understood by the industry and by agents representing clients in the food supplements sector and has never been disputed by Revenue.<\/p><p>Revenue has acknowledged that the scope of its zero rating concession had broadened progressively over time to the point that it had become increasingly difficult to maintain an effective distinction between food supplement products that could benefit from the zero rate and those that were standard rated. Revenue acknowledges that this concessionary approach was unsatisfactory and led to diverging and inconsistent practices. There were continuous efforts by elements in the industry to expand the zero rate to products that should be standard rated, including products claiming to enhance male fertility, promote hair growth, boost tanning, avoid a hangover and reduce stress.<\/p><p>Following complaints from the Irish Health Trade Association (IHTA), Revenue conducted a comprehensive review of the VAT treatment of food supplement products, including getting an expert report on the definition of food for the purposes of the VAT Consolidation Act. The expert prepared a detailed, scientific report that concluded that food supplement products are not conventional food. Based on the expert report and its own legal analysis, Revenue concluded that the status quo was no longer sustainable. <\/p><p>Following this review, Revenue engaged with my Department concerning policy options that might be considered in the context of Finance Bill 2018. The relevant legislation was not changed in Finance Act 2018 and therefore Revenue issued new guidance in December 2018 which removed the concessionary zero rating of various food supplement products with effect from 1 March 2019. Following representation from Deputies and from the industry, I wrote to Revenue outlining my plans to examine the policy and legislative options for the taxation of food supplement products in the context of Finance Bill 2019. Revenue responded by delaying the withdrawal of its concessionary zero rating of the food supplement products concerned until 1 November 2019. This will allow time for the consideration of any legislative changes in the context of Budget 2020. <\/p><p>Over the last few months, my Department carried out a public consultation on the taxation of food supplement products.

As Minister for Finance, I am responsible for the development of the legal framework governing financial regulation of the sector.  This framework is mainly governed by the EU Solvency II Directive, which provides for three ways in which an insurance undertaking can operate within the Irish market.  These are to: <\/p>  <p>  - establish a head office in Ireland (authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland);<\/p>  <p>  - establish a branch in Ireland through Freedom of Establishment (FOE); or<\/p>  <p>  - operate on a Freedom of Services basis (FOS), i.e. conduct business in Ireland from another country.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are companies operating in each of these channels in the Irish insurance market.  The Solvency II framework is designed to allow for a level playing field across the European Union for insurers, not only in terms of access to markets within the EU, but also with regard to the level of supervision and regulation.  Therefore it plays an essential role in facilitating competition in the insurance sector across the EU.<\/p>  <p>  However, there are other factors, beyond the legal and regulatory framework which also inform the decision making processes of insurance companies as to whether or not to operate or to continue to operate in any country.  For example, the number of claims, the level of awards for personal injuries granted, the legal costs associated with settling\/defending claims, and the time taken to settle claims will be important such considerations for insurers. In this regard, there has been some sectors of our economy such as the leisure, adventure and hospitality sectors where, because of these aforementioned factors, insurance cover has either become unavailable or prohibitively expensive.  Indeed, I understand that in recent meetings in London between Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD, and a number of UK insurers\/underwriters who have recently left the Irish insurance market, the reasons above were outlined as factors in  their decision to leave the Irish market.  Therefore for these parts of the Irish market there is undoubtedly an issue around its attractiveness and this consequently has impacted on competitiveness.  <\/p>  <p>  Consequently, in order to create a more competitive environment, the Government is focussing on implementing the recommendations of the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), including those of the second Personal Injuries Commission (PIC) Report. That Report concluded that soft tissue injuries are significantly higher here than in England and Wales (4.4 times) and recommended that action be taken to address this disparity through the establishment of the Judicial Council. The recently enacted Judicial Council Act 2019 provides for the establishment of this Council, which will allow for the recalibration, by the Judiciary, of award levels for personal injuries.  It is now a matter for the Judiciary to establish the Judicial Council and the subsequent Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations due to the constitutional separation of powers, it is my hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and will prioritise it accordingly by completing a first set of guidelines, which take account of the PIC&rsquo;s benchmarking report, as soon as possible.  At the same time, the Law Reform Commission (LRC) has begun a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, taking account of Constitutional considerations as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that the creation and implementation of the Personal Injuries guidelines by the Judiciary will result in the lowering of award levels.  As importantly, I believe it should lead to a greater consistency in award levels for injuries of the same type.  This therefore should mean that there will be less of an incentive for a person to litigate, as they should not be getting any more from a court award than a PIAB award, which in turn should have a significant impact on legal costs.  In summary, I believe that over time the clearest signal that these changes are working is when there is an increase in the number of PIAB cases being accepted by claimants particularly for minor and moderate injuries.  In addition, I believe that the cumulative effects of the completion of the CIWG recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and a more competitive insurance market overall. Furthermore, Government expects that the market will adjust positively to these developments and thus competition and competitiveness throughout the market place should materially improve. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400061#WRC05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Rates","counter":181,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD00200"},{"type":"question","counter":182,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[26960\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he is satisfied that there is a competitive market for mortgages here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":183,"content":"<p>The financial crash and its immediate aftermath had a significant impact on the Irish mortgage market, with a steep increase in mortgage arrears, a sharp slowdown in the rate of new mortgage lending and the withdrawal of some lenders from the Irish market.

Modified domestic demand, an underlying measure of growth in the economy, grew by 4.5 per cent for 2018 as a whole.<\/p><p>One of the best barometers of the health in the economy is the labour market. The strong growth in employment over the last number of years has continued into this year, with total employment increasing by 45,000 (+2.0 per cent) in the year to Q2 2019. As a result, there are now 2.3 million people at work in Ireland.<\/p><p>The cornerstone of our recovery, has been the improvement in our competitiveness. Since July 2008, the Central Bank&rsquo;s real harmonised competitiveness indicator has improved by approximately 22 per cent. The improvement in our competitiveness reflects the hard-won productivity gains made over the last number of years, alongside wage and price moderation. <\/p><p>Importantly, the robust economic growth in recent years has not yet given rise to significant inflationary pressures. In the first eight months of 2019, average annual inflation of just 0.9 per cent was recorded. <\/p><p>On wage developments, while average annual earnings grew by over 3 per cent in 2018, this came on the back of a near decade of low or negative growth in earnings. The rise in labour income is a welcome development. However it needs to be monitored closely, as a significant acceleration in wages could undermine Ireland&rsquo;s relative competitiveness to other European countries.<\/p><p>Over the medium-term, the domestic economy is expected to act as the primary driver of growth. In this context, we must remain conscious of the potential upward pressure this will place on both prices and wages, that could give rise to a loss of competitiveness.<\/p><p>Despite the positive outlook for our economy, the risks over the coming years are numerous and primarily external in nature. The best way we can mitigate against these risks is through prudent budgetary policy, careful management of the public finances and by focusing on competitiveness-oriented policies. Through the National Development Plan in particular, we are investing significantly to address the bottlenecks to growth which emerged during the recovery, such as the need for housing and public infrastructure investment. This should ensure that our economy remains competitive and avoid the build-up of bottlenecks that could limit our growth potential.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":200,"qnumday":85,"qnumall":"[27991\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD02100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on his address to the National Economic Dialogue conference on 26 June 2019 and the external risks and the possibility of a disorderly Brexit.","asker":"1283","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":201,"content":"<p>The fifth National Economic Dialogue (Dialogue) took place on June 26<sup>th<\/sup>and 27<sup>th<\/sup>this year. <\/p><p>The dialogue is an important part of the budgetary process and aims to foster discussion on how best to sustain and strengthen the economy while addressing the many competing economic and social priorities within the limited resources available.<\/p><p>My opening remarks on <i>Understanding the Context: Economic Perspectives<\/i>and my closing remarks at the Dialogue are available at along with the Chair&rsquo;s report on the discussions. <\/p><p>The <i>Stability Programme Update 2019,<\/i>published by my Department in April, sets out the principal economic risks facing the Irish economy, along with an assessment of their relative likelihood and economic impact.

Preparedness and contingency planning must continue at EU and Member State level. <\/p><p>Given the lack of clarity regarding the timing and format that the UK&rsquo;s exit will take, I recently announced that Budget 2020 will be framed on the assumption of a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; Brexit. Three main factors influenced the Government&rsquo;s approach:<\/p><blockquote>-First, to give certainty to businesses and citizens that the Government is prepared for a no-deal Brexit and stands ready to support the economy in such a scenario;<br \/><br \/>-Second, to safeguard the hard won progress of recent years in stabilising the public finances; and <br \/><br \/>-Finally, to avoid a situation in which decisions made in the Budget might need to be reversed in future. <\/blockquote><p>Assuming a no-deal Brexit ensures the Government has the necessary resources at its disposal to meet the impact of this exceptional challenge, while preserving the longer-term sustainability of the public finances.<\/p><p>In a &lsquo;no deal&rsquo; scenario, the Government will make the resources available to support those in need, and to introduce timely, targeted and temporary supports to the sectors of the economy most exposed to the impact of a no-deal Brexit.<\/p><p>Other than &lsquo;Brexit&rsquo;, the main short-term risks relate to a deteriorating international environment and an escalation of trade protectionism. <\/p><p>Over the medium-term, the principal risks relate to potential overheating as the economy approaches full-employment, and changes in other jurisdictions that affect the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporate tax regime. <\/p><p>The economy is in a good position to meet these challenges. Economic growth, which resumed early this decade, has been consistently among the highest in the EU for a number of years, notwithstanding reservations about the headline data. The recovery is perhaps most clearly evident in the labour market. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2 per cent from the peak of 16 per cent in 2012. <\/p><p>The headline budget deficit was eliminated last year for the first time in a decade. The Government has been taking steps to build up the resilience of the economy so that we have the capacity to deal with adverse economic shocks. This includes building up our fiscal buffers by balancing our books, reducing our debt burden and establishing the Rainy Day Fund.<\/p><p>Our companies are being supported to prepare for Brexit, to diversify their markets and supply chains, to develop new skills and to explore new opportunities. <\/p><p>The Government will continue to work to strengthen the resilience of the economy, to maximise opportunities and to prepare our economy for the challenges ahead, including through the Ireland Connected Trade and Investment Strategy, the 10-year National Development Plan and Future Jobs Ireland 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Financial Services Regulation","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD02300"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":86,"qnumall":"[38493\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400062#WRD02400","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated saving to be made from moving the entire cost of regulating the financial industry, with the exception of the credit union industry, from the State to the financial industry.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":204,"content":"<p>Section 32D of the Central Bank Act provides that, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank Commission may make regulations requiring regulated firms to pay a levy in respect of the cost of regulation.  <\/p><p>The Central Bank is moving on a trajectory that will see all regulated financial firms, with the exception of Credit Unions, paying 100% of the cost of regulation by 2024. The paper outlining this approach &ldquo;Funding the cost of regulation&rdquo; is available at the following link.  In order to achieve the move to full industry funding, I recently approved the Central Bank to increase the proportion of financial regulation costs to be recovered from firms on a phased basis to 100% by 2024.  <\/p><p>In relation to the credit union sector, I approved an exception which will see the cost of the levy to that sector being increased on a phased basis to 50% to be reached by 2021, at which time a review of the impact on the sector and a public consultation regarding increasing the levy beyond 50% will take place.

As part of the annual Taxation Strategy Group (TSG) process undertaken by officials from my Department earlier this year, a proposal for an income tax incentive measure to encourage domestic retrofits was examined and published within the Climate Action and Tax paper. This examination was prompted by the publication of the All of Government Climate Action Plan in June 2019, where it was noted that the built environment accounted for 12.7% of Ireland&rsquo;s Greenhouse Gases in 2017. <\/p><p>The paper sought to identify the potential cost of a domestic retrofit tax incentive and to explore the factors that might need to be taken into account in the event that such an incentive was to be considered.  The design model used for this purpose was the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) which expired on 31 December 2018 in accordance with its sunset clause. <\/p><p>Briefly, it was suggested in the TSG paper that the proposed incentive might operate as follows:<\/p><p>- The measure would be targeted at domestic properties with a BER rating of B3 or less; <\/p><p>- Participants in the scheme would be able to claim an income tax credit for expenditure on certain qualifying works; <\/p><p>- The credit would amount to a specified percentage (13.5%) of the total qualifying expenditure (excluding VAT) on the qualifying works, and would be claimed over a 2 year period subsequent to the year in which the works were paid for; <\/p><p>- These works would have to be carried out on a qualifying property by a qualifying contractor.<\/p><p>Qualifying works would include wall insulation, attic insulation, floor insulation, window\/door upgrades, ventilation systems; renewable energy (heat pumps, solar panels), etc. <\/p><p>It was assumed that if an individual receives a grant for qualifying work, then the total &lsquo;qualifying expenditure&rsquo; under the incentive would be reduced by an amount equal to the grant amount. <\/p><p>Among other things, the paper also examined the potential cost of meeting the target set out in the All of Government Climate Action Plan of completing 50,000 building retrofits per annum to achieve a B2 BER up to the year 2030.

It focused on employer and public liability insurance and was responded to by 770 Public Participation Networks members (which equates to just over 5% of total PPN membership). The survey indicated that 83% of respondents have seen their insurance increase over the last 3 years, 45% indicated that they may have to reduce events or services, and more worryingly, 47% indicated that they may have to close within the next year due to rising insurance costs. <\/p><p>This study confirms much of what we already know about there being a significant problem in relation to the cost and availability of public and employer liability cover.  Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules, which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to either consumers or businesses.  A further constraint is the fact that for constitutional reasons, I cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied.  In summary, therefore there is unfortunately no quick fix solution to this matter.<\/p><p>Notwithstanding the above, I wish to reemphasise however that this issue remains a priority for the Government.  The Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG), which was established in July 2016, and which produced two reports, is continuing to work to implement the recommendations of the <i>Cost of Motor Insurance Report <\/i>and the <i>Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance Report<\/i>.  Its most recent Progress Update, the Ninth, was published in July 2019 and shows that the vast majority of recommendations and actions due by Q2 2019 have been completed.  To that end, the key achievements to date from the two reports, including the following:<\/p><p>- The establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission and the publication of its two reports, which included a benchmarking of award levels between Ireland and other jurisdictions for the first time. This showed that award levels for soft tissue injuries in Ireland were 4.4 times higher than in England and Wales; <\/p><p>- The enactment of the <i>Judicial Council Act 2019<\/i>in July, which provides for the establishment of a Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee.  It is now matter for the Judiciary to put in place the Judicial Council and to operationalise the Personal Injuries Guidelines Committee, which will introduce new guidelines to replace the Book of Quantum.  While the Government cannot interfere in their deliberations, I would hope that the Judiciary will recognise the importance of this issue and prioritise it accordingly;<\/p><p>- The Law Reform Commission (LRC) has undertaken a detailed analysis of the possibility of developing constitutionally sound legislation to delimit or cap the amounts of damages which a court may award in respect of some or all categories of personal injuries, as part of its Fifth Programme of Law Reform;<\/p><p>- The establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance.  The CBI is due to make its first report by the end of 2019, and will also make recommendations regarding potentially expanding its scope to include employer and public liability insurance;<\/p><p>- Reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>to strengthen the powers of PIAB around compliance with its procedures;<\/p><p>- Amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to align the timeframes by which claims should be notified to businesses and organisations with GDPR time limits on the keeping of CCTV footage to make it easier for businesses, community groups and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected, and;<\/p><p>- Various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, a divisional focus on insurance fraud guided by the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) which will also train Garda&iacute; all over the country on investigating insurance fraud, and the recent success under <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, which targets insurance-related criminality.<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from August 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24% lower than the July 2016 peak).  However, I recognise there is still much work to be done in the public\/employer liability insurance areas. In this regard, a big issue which the Government is trying to address is the level of awards as well as the inconsistent application of such awards. This problem is a significant part of the reason a number of UK insurers have left the Irish market, a point, which was confirmed to the Minister of State for Financial Services and Insurance, Michael D&rsquo;Arcy TD when he met a number of such companies in London recently <\/p><p>Consequently, I believe that the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses and community groups is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions, and the establishment of the Judicial Council in the near future is very important in this regard.  <\/p><p>What will also be key is that insurers pass on the benefits of any reduction in award levels to policyholders. In this regard, Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy has been engaging with them in order to seek a commitment that they will reduce premiums and, even more importantly, widen their risk appetite to reflect savings made, in particular if there is a recalibration of award levels downwards.  I am also encouraged by the comments made by a number of insurers at the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach Oireachtas Committee in July about the passing on of savings arising from a recalibration of award levels downwards.  <\/p><p>In conclusion, I am believe that the cumulative effects of the completion of the recommendations of the CIWG, including a reduction in award levels, will lead to reductions in pricing in particular for small businesses and community groups and also to a more competitive and stable insurance market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400063#WRE04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Meetings","counter":284,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF00200"},{"type":"question","counter":285,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[38836\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF00300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will report on his meeting with the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer; the issues that were discussed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":286,"content":"<p>I have met with my colleague the UK Chancellor Sajid Javid, on three occasions since he took office.

The FEMPI legislation implemented measures that directly reduced the pay of serving staff and introduced a Public Service Pension Reduction for pensions in payment, subject to certain rates, thresholds and exemptions. As both the annual pensions and lump sum payments of members of pre-existing public service pension schemes (i.e. excluding the Single Public Service Pension Scheme) are directly linked to salary at retirement, the reductions to the pay of public servants would have had a knock on impact on the lump sum payment they received at retirement. <\/p>  <p>  However, because of what is known as the first &lsquo;grace period&rsquo;, those who retired between 1 January 2010 and 29 February 2012 did not have the first FEMPI pay reduction (imposed 1 January 2010) reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or their lump sum. A second round of FEMPI reductions was imposed in 2013 (imposed on 1 July on public servants with an annual remuneration above &euro;65,000). The second &lsquo;grace period&rsquo; meant that those who retired from that point onwards (assuming their pay was affected by those reductions while still serving) did not have those reductions reflected in the salary rate used to calculate their annual pension or lump sum. <\/p>  <p>  Rather than enter into the details of the individual case, which, as I say, is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, I would note that where retirement occurred after 1 March 2012, the retirement lump sum would be calculated by reference to the salary rates in payment on 1 January 2010 (i.e. following the first FEMPI pay reduction). If the salary was subject to the second FEMPI reduction on 1 July 2013, the operation of the second grace period would mean that the lump sum would still have been calculated by reference to the 1 January 2010 rate.<\/p>  <p>  In accordance with normal public service pension arrangements, retirement lump sums are calculated on the rates of salary that a public servant is in receipt of at time of retirement (with the exception of the 'grace period' protection I have described above). I have no proposals to make any change in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, in relation to pension increases, the current policy applying to pensions paid under pre-existing pension schemes was agreed by the Government as part of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 (PSSA). This policy is essentially a time-limited (expires end-2020) resumption of the non-statutory pension increase arrangements, sometimes known as pay parity, which formerly prevailed, but which lapsed in 2010. Under that policy, pay increases applied to serving staff over the course of the PSSA are passed on to those annual pensions where the salary on which the annual pension is based, in any case, does not exceed the salary of a serving staff member with the same grade and scale point, after the pay increase has been applied. If it qualifies, the annual pension is eligible for an increase to the extent that this will ensure alignment with the pay of serving staff.<\/p>  <p>  Guidance on operation of the pension increase policy is set out in my Department&rsquo;s Circular 02\/2018, while further instructions have recently been issued in Circular 19\/2019.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, if the pension in question remains subject to the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), the individual will qualify for a further lessening of its impact, or, indeed, its total removal in 2019 or 2020. The Deputy should also note that, no later than 31 December 2020, I will make an order which will specify a date for the full removal of PSPR from the residual group of PSPR-affected pensions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General","counter":299,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF01700"},{"type":"question","counter":300,"qnumday":124,"qnumall":"[38571\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF01800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the number of requests his Department received from the Office of Comptroller and Auditor General seeking approval for the recruitment of extra staff since 1 January 2018; the number of requests that are approved or refused; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":301,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Revised Estimates Volume 2019 provided &euro;14,638,000 (Gross) for the operation of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

In general, no fee whatsoever is charged for applications under the 2014 Act by an individual for their personal information.  This applies at all stages the FOI process, including with respect to a review by the Information Commissioner.  Based on 2018 figures, this category amounts to almost 60% of all requests.<\/p>  <p>  With respect to non-personal requests, application fees at the initial stage of the process were abolished under the 2014 Act.  Fees of &euro;30 and &euro;50 respectively apply to internal reviews and reviews by the Information Commissioner, although these can be reduced to &euro;10 and &euro;15 respectively, or waived, where a requester holds a medical card.  Based on 2018 figures, over 97% of non-personal requests were satisfactorily handled without the need for review, and as such no application fee was charged. <\/p>  <p>  Available statistics do not dis-aggregate internal reviews of requests for personal information, to which no fee applies, and internal reviews of non-personal requests, nor are instances highlighted where reduced fees or a fee waiver applied, therefore it is not possible to state a precise sum recouped in application fees.  Given that, in 2018, 40% of requests were for non-personal information, 1,082 internal reviews overall were carried out by public bodies, and the Commissioner carried out 328 reviews to which an application fee potentially applied, the total figure for all application fees paid in that year may be estimated at well below &euro;40,000.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation also provides for search and retrieval fees to be charged where a non-personal FOI request requires a minimum of five hours of work merely locating and gathering records.  Therefore, a fee of this nature is only charged where a non-personal request is relatively large, and does not take account of the totality of the work involved in responding, but only the search and retrieval portion.  The fee payable by a requester is capped at a maximum of &euro;500, even where the cost of the work involved may exceed this, and may in appropriate cases be waived entirely on public interest grounds.  Moreover, it should be noted that under the 2014 Act officials are obliged to assist requesters where appropriate in making a more focused request so as to meet their objectives by the most efficient possible means, and that there is nothing to prevent requesters making follow-up requests for additional information.  No figures are available at present to confirm the exact proportion of non-personal requests that attracted a fee, or the total sum recouped by way of search and retrieval charges.<\/p>  <p>  The final costing of a proposal to remove the remaining FOI fee provisions must also take account of the potential knock-on costs to the exchequer arising out of likely demands on the resources of both public bodies and the Information Commissioner through increased usage of their respective review functions, as well as, in the case of search and retrieval fees, the likely requirement to process a larger amount of more resource-intensive requests.  An analysis of this nature has not been carried out to date, and as such no estimate can be provided in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  As matters stand, administering the Freedom of Information system in the context of ever-increasing demand presents a significant administrative and resourcing challenge to public bodies.  Since 2013, the last full year of operation for the previous legislation, the number of FOI requests received by public bodies has almost doubled to a total of 36,896 requests in 2018.  The abolition of fees in most cases has been a significant contributory factor to this increase.  In order to support this system, in 2019 the Office of the Information Commissioner was allocated a dedicated program budget of &euro;3,292,000 out of the total allocation of &euro;11,718,000 to the Ombudsman group, within which it shares certain support resources.<\/p>  <p>  Estimating the true cost of the Freedom of Information system within public bodies has historically proven difficult, as doing so has been taken as necessitating an additional administrative burden on already hard-pressed decision makers to accurately record and collate the time spent on each request at various levels of seniority, as well as other associated costs.  In this regard, the Central Policy Unit for Freedom of Information at my Department has recently initiated a project aiming at measuring the cost to the exchequer of administering FOI in a robust and user friendly manner.  The methodology remains under development, however it is intended that a figure for the true cost of FOI should be available by mid-2020.  Assuming that the number of requests continues on previous trends, it may be anticipated even at this juncture that the total cost will run well into eight figures.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Sector Pay","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02300"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":126,"qnumall":"[38674\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02400","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time corporate compliance manager.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":307,"qnumday":127,"qnumall":"[38675\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02500","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time legal adviser.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":308,"qnumday":128,"qnumall":"[38676\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time principal solicitor.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":309,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[38677\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time enforcement portfolio manager.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":130,"qnumall":"[38679\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time enforcement lawyer.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":311,"qnumday":131,"qnumall":"[38680\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time principal officer.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":312,"qnumday":132,"qnumall":"[38681\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time professional accountant grade 1.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":313,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[38682\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time State solicitor.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":314,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[38685\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time executive officer.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"question","counter":315,"qnumday":137,"qnumall":"[38686\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400064#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the yearly wage cost of a whole-time clerical officer.","asker":"1258","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":316,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 to 133, inclusive, 136 and 137 together.<\/p><p>The main civil service pay scales are published in circulars which are a matter of public record and available at .

The cost and other implications must be fully considered by the Boards of Managements before a decision is made. It is important for schools, in conjunction with parents, to retain local autonomy for decisions on the use of digital technology, including tablet devices, laptops, and learning platforms, and how best to manage their integration into classroom practice reflective of their own context and requirements. In making this decision each school should refer to and reflect on the available information. <\/p>  <p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers Technology in Education (PDST-TIE) offers advice to schools and have developed an advice sheets on digital technology in education, including on the adoption of Laptops and tablets in schools.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th   of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.  <\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.   <\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances the industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.

I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions and understand the issues they have raised.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year I relaxed the moratorium for those C&amp;C and ETB schools with enrolments of 700 and more which allow them to employ additional school secretaries up to a maximum of two per school. There are 91 schools in the C&amp;C and ETB Sector who meet this criteria, based on the information currently available to this Department. This is an initial step and has taken immediate effect.<\/p>  <p>  Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools.  The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008.  These schemes have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes.  The current grant scheme was agreed in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, published in 1991.  <\/p>  <p>  The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under these grant schemes.  It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, any staff taken on to support those functions are employees of individual schools.  Specific responsibility for the pay and conditions rests with the school. <\/p>  <p>  On foot of a Chairman&rsquo;s Note to the Lansdowne Road Agreement, my Department engaged with the Unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 be phased in over that period.  This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.  <\/p>  <p>  The arbitration agreement was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower-paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of &euro;8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration has from 1 January 2019, been paid &euro;13 per hour which is a 50% increase in that individual&rsquo;s hourly pay. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills on the 9th of April to discuss the status of non-teaching staff.<\/p>  <p>  In May this year officials from my Department had discussions with F&Oacute;RSA trade union representatives as part of a planned meeting. F&Oacute;RSA took the opportunity to formally table a pay claim.  <\/p>  <p>  This was tabled as a follow-on claim from the current pay agreement for this cohort of staff which lasts until December 2019. The Department issued surveys on the 10th of July to establish the full current cost of the trade union&rsquo;s claim. This is standard practice.  <\/p>  <p>  F&Oacute;RSA's claim will be fully considered once the current costings have been determined on completion of the survey analysis. <\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department met with F&Oacute;RSA representatives last week. Management Bodies representing the employers of schools impacted by the action were also in attendance at the meeting. The purpose of the meeting was to further explore the details of the pay claim as presented by F&Oacute;RSA and the nature of the industrial action.   <\/p>  <p>  In these circumstances the industrial action by F&Oacute;RSA members is considered premature, not least because the period of the current arbitration agreement has not expired.

The procurement of new accommodation centres has been approached in two ways. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, the Department has advertised in the national media for expressions of interest from property owners for a short-term contract (usually one year) to meet demand while the regional tender process is rolled out nationally. Centres in Kenmare, Lisdoonvarna, Mallow, Moate and Wicklow were opened in 2018 through this process. Further centres may also be opened through this process.<\/p>  <p>  Secondly, my Department is running procurement competitions on a regional basis throughout the country to procure accommodation through the government&rsquo;s procurement portal, Etenders. These contracts will be longer term than the expressions of interest with a minimum contract duration of 2 years on offer and a maximum contract duration of 4 years. <\/p>  <p>  Accommodation providers can offer premises both through the expressions of interest process or the tender process. <\/p>  <p>  The following regional competitions have progressed through the evaluation stage and are in the mobilisation phase; the South East, Midlands and the MidWest Regions.  Evaluation is underway for the South West and Western Regions.  The closing date for bids for the Mid East Region was the 16 September and evaluation will commence shortly. Advertisements for bids for the Dublin Region was published on 18 September and advertisements for the Borders Region are scheduled to be published by the end of this month.  <\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware, that until the procurement process, which is commercially sensitive, is complete, it is not possible to confirm any specific locations or premises.<\/p>  <p>  Tenders received are evaluated on the most economically advantageous tender method which assesses bids on the quality of service as well as price. The level, expertise and qualifications of staff are assessed as part of this process. <\/p>  <p>  I recently published agreed National Standards for accommodation centres. The Standards will apply to all service providers contracted by the Department to operate and manage accommodation and reception centres. They provide a framework for the continued development of supports and services for residents by improving the quality of care and ensuring consistency across the centres. A copy of the Standards can be found on my Department's website www.justice.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400069#WRL01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"question","counter":553,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[38587\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400069#WRL01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if he has consulted with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government regarding accommodation needs of persons that cannot be facilitated in direct provision centres due to lack of accommodation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":554,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is experiencing significant upward pressure on its accommodation portfolio due to an increase in the number of people claiming international protection and an associated demand for accommodation and related services. In the first half of this year alone, we have seen a 36% increase in the number of applications received. <\/p>  <p>  Our 38 existing accommodation centres are currently at full capacity. To ensure that we can continue to provide accommodation for all applicants who require it,  since September 2018, my Department has arranged for the provision of emergency accommodation in hotels and guest houses.  Every effort is being made to re-accommodate residents in these emergency locations to a dedicated accommodation centre as quickly as possible. My Department is actively working on securing additional capacity, both in existing centres and through sourcing new centres via a series of regional procurement competitions and an expression of interest process that was advertised in the national media. <\/p>  <p>  Currently, we are accommodating 6,056 people across our 38 accommodation centres and a further 1,363 people in 34 emergency accommodation locations. <\/p>  <p>  Officials of my Department regularly engage with other Government Departments and Public Sector organisations to ensure that everyone in the protection process can access the necessary public services and supports.  Regular meetings take place with representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department Education and Skills, and with representatives from the Health Services Executive and the Education and Welfare Service.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department is represented on the Homeless Interagency Group and the Dublin Joint Homelessness Consultative Forum.

What is being proposed under Sl&aacute;intecare is not simply a reconfiguration of hospital groups, but something much more significant and fundamental. It is the establishment of new health service management structures, which will be tasked with planning, managing and delivering all health and social care services for a given population based on coherent regional areas, on a population health basis. And within these regions, acute hospitals will work with primary, community and social care to provide integrated care. <\/p><p>As a first step in this process, I announced the areas for six new regional bodies in July. Our Lady&rsquo;s Hospital, Navan will come within the remit of Area A which is depicted on the map in Appendix A. Details of the geographical areas covered by each new regional health area and the hospitals within these areas is also outlined in the appendix. It is important to note that the Mater Hospital is also within the remit of Area A. <\/p><p>The announcement of these areas is an important step in signalling the future shape of the health service. A number of pieces of research, analysis and consultation were undertaken to support the identification of the optimal boundaries of the new regions.  This included a review of approaches taken internationally, a review of national policy documents on health reform and previous criteria used in determining regional health bodies, a public consultation process and a detailed analysis of service usage patterns. <\/p><p>As agreed by Government, my Department will now progress the development of detailed policy proposals on reconfiguration of the HSE, including the establishment of regional health bodies, and bring these proposals back to Government for approval next year. This process will provide an opportunity for further consultation and engagement with all key stakeholders to ensure that any structural changes do not unduly cause disruption and loss of focus on service delivery and the roll-out of the broader reform programme, and details of this will be announced in due course. <\/p><p>I would also like to reassure the Deputy that the announcement of future regional areas will not have any immediate impact on services. As the Deputy is aware, Ireland East Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of re-design work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan Hospital within the current Group and to ensure that it will provide more services safely and appropriately with better linkages to primary, continuing and social care. <\/p><p>  It is intended that the Hospital Group will continue to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed both in terms of the current Hospital Group configuration and also during the transition to future arrangements. <\/p><p>  \">Regional Health Areas Map<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400070#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Professionals","counter":649,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400070#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":650,"qnumday":255,"qnumall":"[38283\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400070#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will legislate for a Supreme Court judgment (details supplied) in the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) (Amendment) Bill 2019.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":651,"content":"<p>The Supreme Court decision in question confirmed that there is a &ldquo;seriousness&rdquo; threshold for cases involving <i>&ldquo;<\/i>poor professional performance<i>&rdquo;. <\/i>The Court clarified that this<i><\/i>threshold is provided for in the definition of poor professional performance in the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, and, it follows, in the other health professional regulatory Acts which the Regulated Professions (Health and Social Care) Amendment Bill 2019 Bill is amending.<\/p><p>The case in question illustrated that registrants who receive one of the minor sanctions are left with limited options to challenge that decision.

while potentially safer than smoking, evidence on long-term safety has yet to be established. <\/p><p>In relation to e-cigarettes as an aid to smoking cessation HIQA advised the Minister for Health as follows: <\/p><p><i>Although the currently available results for e-cigarettes are promising, there is insufficient evidence at present to reliably demonstrate their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation. <\/i><\/p><p>Although the HIQA assessment was published only in 2017, the evidence on e-cigarettes is rapidly evolving. In that context, in March this year I asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the evidence in relation to the health harms of e-cigarettes, their effectiveness as an aid to smoking cessation and whether they act as a gateway to smoking tobacco products. The evidence review is expected to be completed in March 2020.<\/p><p>In addition my Department continues to monitor developments and publications by authoritative bodies on the safety of e-cigarettes and whether they facilitate smoking cessation.<\/p><p>In Ireland e-cigarettes are regulated under the European Union (Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco and Related Products) Regulations 2016 (S.I. 271\/2016). These Regulations transpose the EU Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014\/40\/EU). <\/p><p>Under these Regulations health warnings which advise consumers that e-cigarettes contain nicotine which is a highly addictive substance are mandatory. The Regulations also provide for mandatory safety and quality requirements for e-cigarettes and refill containers, including maximum nicotine concentrations for e-cigarettes containing nicotine, and maximum volumes for cartridges, tanks and nicotine liquid containers. <\/p><p>Finally the Regulations require e-cigarette manufacturers or importers to notify the Health Service Executive of all products that they place on the market and, if a manufacturers, importer or distributor has a reason to believe that a product is not safe, they are required to immediately notify the Health Service Executive and to explain what corrective action has been taken.  <\/p><p>In relation to advertising, the Regulations prohibit advertisements for e-cigarettes online and in printed publications except for those directed at persons in the e-cigarette industry or publications printed and published outside the EU and intended for markets outside the EU. In addition, advertisements for e-cigarettes are prohibited on television and on radio. Finally, any form of contribution to an event, activity or person with the aim of promoting e-cigarettes and with a cross-border effect is also prohibited<\/p><p>In addition to the current legislation my Department is developing a draft scheme for a Public Health (Tobacco Products and Nicotine Inhaling Products) Bill which will include provisions to:<\/p><p>- introduce a new licensing system for the retail sale of tobacco products and nicotine-inhaling products such as e-cigarettes <\/p><p>- prohibit the sale of nicotine inhaling products to persons under the age of 18 <\/p><p>- prohibit the sale of tobacco products and nicotine inhaling products by persons under the age of 18 <\/p><p>I intend to bring the draft scheme to Government in the coming weeks. <\/p><p>The current health advice given by the Health Service Executive (&lsquo;HSE&rsquo;) reflects the position from the HIQA research and conclusions. <\/p><p>The HSE advises people who smoke that currently e-cigarettes are not recommended as a help to stop smoking because the safety and effectiveness profile is uncertain. People who want to stop smoking and \/or using e-cigarettes, and who want support, can use HSE QUIT services and access help. Research shows that using stop smoking services like the HSE&rsquo;s QUIT service makes someone twice as likely to quit for good. Even better news is that using stop smoking services in combination with Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and stop smoking medication makes people three to four times more likely to quit. The HSE&rsquo;s QUIT service is a free, personal support service to help quitters &ndash; providing a team of trained advisors, online tools, understanding and support. If anyone is thinking of giving up smoking, or is using e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation aid, the QUIT service can help over the phone, on Facebook or Twitter, via email or text, or through Live Chat via the support. The QUIT Service also has a network of face-to-face HSE QUIT services in locations around the country, providing one-to-one and group support for smokers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400071#WRN04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescriptions Data","counter":708,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400071#WRN04900"},{"type":"question","counter":709,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[38365\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400071#WRN05000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of prescriptions issued to medical card holders for oxycodone in each of the years 2009 to 2018 and to date in 2019;

The HPV test is a more accurate testing mechanism than liquid-based cytology, which is the current testing mechanism. I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible and have approved a draft project plan for the HPV primary screening project.

The report covers the clinical and technical issues involved in ensuring both:<\/p><p>1. the safe and effective provision of mesh procedures in urogynaecology and<\/p><p>2. an appropriate response to women who suffer complications as a result of undergoing such procedures.<\/p><p>This report was published on the Department of Health website on 21 November 2018. <\/p><p>The CMO&rsquo;s Report identifies that for many women, surgical procedures using synthetic mesh devices have provided a more effective and less invasive form of treatment than traditional SUI and POP procedures. However, mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women. These are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>The Report makes 19 recommendations including:<\/p><p>- the development of patient information and informed consent materials;<\/p><p>- surgical professional training and multidisciplinary expertise in units carrying out mesh procedures;<\/p><p>- the development of clinical guidance;<\/p><p>- the development of information systems to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices;<\/p><p>- ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications; and<\/p><p>- ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications.<\/p><p>In advance of the report&rsquo;s completion, the HSE was requested in May 2018 to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. <\/p><p>The HSE was also asked by the Chief Medical Officer on 24 July 2018 to pause all mesh procedures where clinically safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals.<\/p><p>A central finding of the CMO&rsquo;s report is that there are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland concerning the use of mesh implants. Routinely collected clinical activity data does not identify the number of women who have received mesh implants in HSE funded hospitals.  This is being addressed through ongoing work to implement recommendation (iii) above.<\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group was convened by the HSE, to advise on and progress all of the recommendations which included three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups to advise on and action all of the recommendations above. <\/p><p>I am informed that an ongoing work programme for the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications is being progressed by the HSE. This work includes identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. <\/p><p>Pending the completion of this work, the HSE is also examining options to address service requirements for patients with immediate or urgent needs. <\/p><p>As was requested by the Secretary General of my Department in November 2018, the HSE has prepared an Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, which was approved by the Leadership Team in the HSE and published on the HSE website on 26 April 2019, which I hope provides further clarity on this issue.<\/p><p>I am informed that the HSE has advised that a detailed progress report on implementation of the recommendations will be provided to my Department and this report is awaited. <\/p><p>The HSE has published a dedicated webpage about vaginal mesh implants, including contact information for women suffering complications, which I hope is a useful resource. This can be found on the HSE website. <\/p><p>I would strongly encourage all women affected by mesh to engage with the relevant HSE contact points provided, to ensure that their service needs can be identified and provided for.<\/p><p>At my meeting with the Mesh Survivors Ireland Group on 7 March 2019 I agreed to continue engagement with them on a pathway forward, to ensure that the ongoing clinical management of this patient group is in line with international best practice and emerging evidence. It is my intention to meet again with the Mesh Survivors Ireland group in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400074#WRQ05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":899,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400075#WRR00200"},{"type":"question","counter":900,"qnumday":340,"qnumall":"[38601\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400075#WRR00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the weighting percentages to be used as part of the upcoming HSE FreeStyle Libre review decision making process that will be given to criteria (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":901,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400075#WRR00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Occupational Therapy Provision","counter":902,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400075#WRR00500"},{"type":"question","counter":903,"qnumday":341,"qnumall":"[38602\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400075#WRR00600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the lack of early intervention occupational therapy services in Coolock primary care centre (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1362","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":904,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.

These have included posts for the HSE's national antimicrobial resistance team, additional posts for laboratory\/screening activities, and infection prevention and control teams. <\/p><p>- A suite of publicly available guidance documents has been developed by the CPE Expert Group.  The Group provides expert advice across health care settings regarding actions that should be taken in relation to CPE screening and control of spread of CPE.  <\/p><p>- A dedicated HSE communications campaign and website with focused information and education tools is in place. <\/p><p>While the number of newly diagnosed CPE patients has slightly increased, this is in the context of substantially increased screening activity over the past year. <\/p><p>Over two years, my Department has provided dedicated AMR funding, totalling &euro;6.6 million in full year costs.

However, my Department has contacted ESB regarding the charge point at Newbridge and was advised that the charge point is to be replaced later this year when eCars takes delivery of new replacement chargers. In addition to these chargers operated by ESB ecars, there are public chargers provided by motor dealerships, local authorities, retail outlets and private companies. <\/p><p>I am in the process of increasing the level of investment in charging infrastructure. Under the first call for applications from the Climate Action Fund, funding of up to &euro;10 million will support ESB eCars to develop a nationwide, state-of-the-art electric vehicle fast charging network. This project includes the installation of 90 high-power chargers each of which will be capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously, upgrading 50 existing standard chargers to fast chargers and replacing over 250 existing standard chargers with next generation high reliability models. This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022. The locations of the chargers that will be installed as part of this project have not been finalised. However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by ESB eCars and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>Last month, I announced funding to support the rollout by Local Authorities of up to 1,000 on-street public charge points for electric vehicles over the next 5 years. This will cater mainly for electric vehicle owners who rely on on-street parking as their primary means of parking near their homes. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland will administer a scheme where Local Authorities can apply for funding to develop on-street charging infrastructure. The detailed terms and conditions for the scheme are currently being developed and I expect the scheme to open for applications shortly. <\/p><p>In addition, we will introduce new regulations to require non-domestic buildings with over 20 car parking spaces to install charging facilities.<\/p><p>Home charging is the primary method of charging for the majority of electric vehicles both internationally and in Ireland. Charging at home at night is the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way to charge an electric vehicle. Given the high proportion of homes with driveways and dedicated parking spaces, Ireland has greater capacity for home charging than many other countries. A Government grant of up to &euro;600 is available, via the SEAI, to the purchasers of new and second-hand electric vehicles to support the installation of home chargers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400078#WRU00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Living Wage","counter":1068,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400078#WRU01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1069,"qnumday":405,"qnumall":"[38243\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400078#WRU01400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the number of workers employed by his Department and in each office or agency under the aegis of his Department that earn less than the living wage of &euro;12.30 per hour; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1327","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1070,"content":"<p>My Department currently has 25 staff members who earn less than &euro;12.30 gross per hour.

The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department. These upgrades are provided free of charge to the homeowner. This year I initially allocated &euro;24m to the scheme, and following a mid-year capital review additional funding was made available, bringing the total allocation up to &euro;39.8m. <\/p><p>Prior to 2018, the Warmer Homes Scheme predominantly focussed on delivering shallow measures such as attic and cavity wall insulation.

This was a very positive step forward and opened the scheme up to many who would previously have been unable to get their walls insulated.<\/p><p>This change has meant that windows can also now be provided under the scheme.

An increased budget allocation in Tourism Ireland for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I continue to encourage all airports to avail of this funding to optimise air services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400079#WRV03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":1140,"qnumday":437,"qnumall":"[37470\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400079#WRV03800","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the status of preparations for facilitating persons and materials travelling through the Port of Cork in the event of a no-deal Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1213"},{"type":"question","counter":1141,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[38345\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400079#WRV03900","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the up-to-date preparations for facilitating persons and materials travelling through the Port of Cork in the event of a no-deal Brexit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1284","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1142,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 437 and 440 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s current assessment is that there is a significant risk of a no-deal Brexit, which will have profound implications for Ireland.

My Department participates in the co-ordination structures established to facilitate a whole-of-Government response to the issues raised by Brexit, including participation in the interdepartmental group on the EU and Brexit and the Brexit co-ordinators' group.<\/p><p>Consultations by my Department regarding Brexit with key maritime stakeholders including ports has included a Transport and Logistics All Island Sectorial meeting in Dundalk in January 2017, three Brexit Maritime Transport Workshops\/Seminars (in April 2017, March 2018, and in January 2019) with a further Maritime Transport Workshop\/Seminar took place earlier this month (September 2019) focussed on Maritime Connectivity and Brexit preparedness.<\/p><p>I do not believe that tariffs will apply on goods passing through the UK or using the UK landbridge for transit to access the Continental EU market to and from Ireland, as such product is going from one EU market to another and tariffs do not apply between EU countries.  Some tariffs could, of course, apply to goods exported to and imported from the UK.  <\/p><p>There is potential for the use of the UK landbridge to become disrupted for Irish exporters and importers in a scenario where the Dover - Calais route in particular may become heavily congested in a no-deal Brexit to the extent that significant numbers of Irish businesses may seek alternatives including direct routes to and from France.  My Department together with the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO) has examined the maritime capacity for direct sailings between Ireland and continental EU ports as a potential alternative route for trade currently using the Landbridge.  Based on extensive consultations with the shipping sector and wider, I believe that sufficient capacity should be available on direct routes to continental ports following a &lsquo;No Deal&rsquo; Brexit and should demand for further capacity arise, because of disruption to the UK landbridge, the shipping sector have assured my Department and the IMDO that they can and will respond quickly to meet such demands.  In the context of Brexit, there has already been an additional increased capacity over the past two years on direct routes with more planned for 2020.  My Department has also established that there is capacity in ports other than the two main ports dealing with Roll-on \/ Roll-off traffic (RoRo) traffic, Dublin and Rosslare, that could be of some assistance in the event of a hard Brexit.  The main spare capacity available in 2019 is in relation to Lift-on\/ Lift -off (LO-LO), in particular at the ports of Waterford, Shannon Foynes, and Cork, and for bulk traffic. However, shipping services are market driven and I believe that ferry operators will respond to economic developments and increase or decrease capacity from particular ports in response to market developments.  There have already been responses from the shipping companies adding additional freight capacity on direct sailings to the continent. To take one example, the Port of Cork saw the addition of a new route in May 2018 with Brittany Ferries&rsquo; commencing the service to Santander and Roscoff with the <i>Connemara<\/i>, whose capacity is 27,414 GT. <\/p><p>As regards freight train or rail freight capacity, Irish Rail is actively engaging with a number of parties regarding emerging rail freight opportunities within the container and bulk markets and will focus on the commercial, environmental and wider economic value that rail freight offers within these markets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400080#WRW01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Transport Authority Funding","counter":1161,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400080#WRW01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1162,"qnumday":445,"qnumall":"[38403\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400080#WRW01400","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if funding will be provided to the NTA for an oversight delivery office in Cork for the delivery of the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy 2040; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1163,"content":"<p>I am not aware of any proposal by the National Transport Authority (NTA) to establish an oversight delivery office in Cork for the delivery of the Cork Metropolitan Area Transport Strategy 2040 and any such proposal would be a matter in the first instance for the NTA.

There is also an offshoot to the core Port of Shannon Foynes. The Dublin-Rosslare Europort rail line, and roadways, link to Rosslare Harbour, a harbour which is on the TEN-T comprehensive Network but which does not meet the threshold for TEN-T core port status.  <\/p><p>Rosslare Europort is unique among the State-owned ports, as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts, but is instead operated on a commercial basis as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  While State investment in relation to the port is not permitted under EU Regulations on State Aid, Project 2040 sets out the Government's plans in relation to roads projects such as the recently opened Gorey to Enniscorthy stretch of the M11 and the planned Oilgate to Rosslare stretch of the N11\/N25.<\/p><p>In relation to the Port, I am satisfied that Rosslare Europort as a division of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is effectively managing operations at the port and looking at the potential of the Port to develop further and take advantage of any new opportunities. The port is targeting growth and new business opportunities, and received the approval of the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann Board for a strategic plan to grow the port&rsquo;s business.  This includes investment plans for up to &euro;25 million in customer facilities and port infrastructure, port assets, and new technology.  The Port is engaging with a number of potential new shipping customers to supplement existing operators and offer greater choice to freight and passenger business.  <\/p><p>As regards the potential for EU funding for the development of Rosslare Europort going forward, the Deputy will be aware that Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) co-funding is available to projects on both the comprehensive and the core parts of the TEN-T Network, subject to such projects satisfying the eligibility criteria of a given call for proposals, and being selected in the evaluation process.<\/p><p>While the current CEF programme finishes at end 2020, a proposal for a new CEF Regulation for the period 2021 &ndash;2027 was published by the European Commission in May 2018. Ireland has advocated at EU level for projects on our comprehensive network to continue to be eligible for co-funding during the period 2021 - 2027.<\/p><p>Ireland submitted written comments to the European Commission in conjunction with two other island Member States, Cyprus and Malta, calling for projects on the comprehensive network in Member States which have no land border with another Member State to be included as eligible actions. This position was accepted by the Commission during negotiations, and as a result the latest text of the proposal retains this amendment. Subject to the proposed Regulation being adopted, this means that during the period 2021 &ndash; 2027, projects on Ireland&rsquo;s comprehensive TEN-T network, including the rail and road network, will be eligible to apply for CEF co-funding through relevant calls for proposals.<\/p><p>With regard to the amending the TEN-T network, the EU Transport Commissioner, Violeta Bulc, wrote to EU Transport Ministers in February 2019, announcing that the European Commission is advancing the review of the TEN-T Network, which was due to take place no later than December 2023. This review process will include: an evaluation study, due to be completed in spring 2020; a public stakeholder consultation, which was open for contributions from April to July 2019; and targeted consultations with Member States and a wide range of stakeholders later this year. Following the conclusion of the Commission&rsquo;s review, a legislative proposal to amend the TEN-T Regulation may follow.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that, in August 2019, honouring a Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, I made a submission to Commissioner Bulc on the matter of reviewing the TEN-T network.

The <i>Climate Action Plan<\/i>has set out measures to encourage a transition away from the use of petrol and diesel, particularly towards electrification in the light-duty (passenger car and van) fleets. In addition, Government will also play an important leadership role in promoting and normalising alternatives by investing in low-emissions technology in its bus fleet. <\/p><p>The transition is, however, not expected to be uniform across all vehicle sectors.  The development of electrified fleet is not yet as advanced in the coach sector as it is for passenger cars, vans and low-floor buses.  Thus, in the short to medium term, other alternative fuels which are already commercially available - such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biofuels - may have a role to play in the heavy-duty sectors where electrification is not yet commercially viable.<\/p><p>Generally, as new fuels and technologies advance, production levels increase and more vehicle models become available and cheaper in the coming years, so these new technologies are expected to reach total cost of ownership parity as we move towards 2030, making the switch easier and cost-effective for both business and private consumers.  Also, developments in the cost of diesel over time, amongst other factors, may position ultra-low emission and zero-emission fuels as an increasingly attractive and viable investment for Irish businesses.<\/p><p>I expect that the anticipated improvements in alternatively-fuelled vehicle technology, reductions in purchase prices, increased driving range and model availability, coupled with a strong Government commitment to invest in the recharging network, will have a positive impact in uptake and consequently in driving further market development. <\/p><p>Policy about the supports and measures to underpin the transition will be kept under constant consideration and I will continue to work closely with Ministers Bruton and Donohoe and their respective Departments to map out the new policy pathway that will be necessary to ensure that Ireland is well positioned to make the transition to electrification, and to other ultra-low emission alternatives, as efficiently as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400082#WRY01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Transport Programme Funding","counter":1240,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400082#WRY01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1241,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[38858\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400082#WRY01200","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the estimated cost of increasing funding to Local Link by 10%, 20%, 33% and 50%, respectively in tabular form.","asker":"1280","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1242,"content":"<p>The total allocation to Local Link in 2019 is &euro;21 million, and percentage amounts can be calculated from this base.

The payment is designed to preserve the financial incentive to take-up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might be marginally better off in employment than on social welfare payments.  It also seeks to alleviate child poverty.  To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.

Budget 2012 contained a measure which provided for the assessment of carer&rsquo;s benefit and carer&rsquo;s allowance payments in determining entitlement to WFP. This measure brought the treatment of these two payments for WFP purposes into line with the treatment of all other primary social welfare payments.  It also provided for a more consistent approach to the concurrent payment of WFP with other social welfare payments.

Appeal processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision.  There has been some improvement in 2019.

The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. <\/p>  <p>   There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was incorrect.  It is often the case that new evidence is provided with an appeal and that, as a result, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person of the Department.

This interim pension calculation is based on a requirement of forty years of social insurance contributions for qualification for maximum rate pension.  The measures also provide for inclusion of up to twenty years of HomeCaring periods for time spend out of the workforce for parenting or caring reasons.<\/p>  <p>  Homecaring periods are not time bound, they can occur at any time during a claimant's working life.  This differs from the existing Homemakers scheme, which applies a disregard for periods out of the workforce for caring duties, after April 1994, under the yearly averaging system.  This additional scope for homecaring periods provides an opportunity for those awarded under Budget 2012 rate bands, particularly women, who took time out of the work place to care for children and others, to achieve a higher rate of pension.  The maximum number of combined HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits that can be used as part of the new pension calculation is 1,040 (or 20 years) as provided for under the Social Welfare Pensions &amp;amp; Civil Registration Act 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The person concerned applied for and was awarded a reduced rate State pension (contributory) in 2016.

The person concerned has 755 paid social insurance contributions, which, when combined with the maximum permissible number of HomeCaring periods and reckonable credits of 1,040, results in a overall usable total of 1,795.  When this number (1,795) is divided by 2,080 (equivalent to 40 years), this results in a payment entitlement rate of 86.30% of the maximum rate of pension.

Also, such a termination notice must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment\/renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such  a risk would be likely to exist for at least 3 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The 2019 Act provides additional powers for  the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions.

It was first confirmed in the wild in Ireland in July 2019. The first two positive tests recorded were  from rabbits &ndash; one in Wicklow, the other in Clare. The first report of and RHD2 positive test in an Irish hare came on the 9<sup>th<\/sup>August &ndash; an animal found dying in the Wexford Slobs Nature Reserve. The disease has now been confirmed from six different counties &ndash; Cork, Clare, Leitrim, Offaly, Wicklow and Wexford.<\/p><p>A post mortem of each dead animal has been carried out by qualified personnel in the regional laboratories of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine (DAFM). Tissue samples have then been sent to that Department&rsquo;s specialist virology lab in Backweston where the RHD tests take place. <\/p><p>Most of the research available on the particular strain of virus, RHD2, comes from rabbits to date.  From this work, and some investigations in a number of hare populations around Europe, we know that the RHD2 strain is highly contagious and has led to significant declines in wild rabbit populations across Europe since it first appeared in 2010. It has also been reported from several different species of hares. <\/p><p>The disease is density-dependent (i.e. the higher the density of animals the higher the incidence of the disease). The virus is extremely resistant, remaining viable for up to two months in the environment. It can be passed on by direct contact, in faeces (including the faeces of predators that have consumed infected animals) and in urine. Infected carcasses can harbour infective virus for several months post mortem. The virus can also be transported on soil, shoes and on clothing.  Environmental contamination presents significant difficulties in terms of any biosecurity responses. There is no cure for the disease and while some animals are believed to be carriers and thus apparently immune, mortality of up to 70% is possible.<\/p><p>In an effort to reduce the spread of the disease, biosecurity measures have been put in place at the two NPWS Nature Reserves where the disease has been located &ndash; Wexford Wildlife Reserve and Boora Bog. The Office of Public Works have also implemented biosecurity measures at Scattery Island &ndash; one of the locations in Clare where the disease has been confirmed.<\/p><p>There is an effective vaccine against RHD2 available for domestic rabbits. However, this has not been tested on wild rabbits and has not been tested on hares.<b><\/b>Licensing of vaccines for use on wild hares would require authorisations from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) and also potentially the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p><p>My Department's NPWS Staff are continuing to monitor reports of wild rabbit and hare deaths to gain a fuller understanding of the extent and impact of this disease in Ireland. At least 4 more hares from three different counties are currently with DAFM for testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400086#WRCC01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Arts Funding","counter":1458,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400086#WRCC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":1459,"qnumday":565,"qnumall":"[38398\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019092400086#WRCC01400","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the available funding for artists under 18 years of age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1305","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1460,"content":"<p>The Creative Youth Plan under the Creative Ireland Programme commits to specific actions to increase and enhance access to a range of creative and cultural activities and practices for young people.
