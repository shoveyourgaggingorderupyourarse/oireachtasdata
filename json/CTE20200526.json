I am joined by my colleague, Ms Anne Costello, nursing committee director, Nursing Homes Ireland.  The work of this committee will represent one of the most important analysis of a national emergency that will forever be ingrained in our country's history.  I wish it well in its work in the weeks ahead.<\/p> <p>  Nursing homes are traditionally very positive settings and homes of inspiration and happiness to the communities within them.  They are a home from home.  Covid-19 has brought huge levels of upset, sadness and worry in through their doors.  I now take this opportunity to call upon us to commemorate forever all those who, tragically, lost their lives in our nursing homes and in our country because of this cruel virus.  We should take the opportunity to laud the considerable sacrifices of nursing home residents.  The loss of a loved one's personal touch and, for many, the loss of friends has caused huge upset and worry for thousands of our most special residents.  Under very pressurised circumstances, our staff have made extra time to sit with residents and have prioritised the use of technology to connect residents with loved ones, often taking time outside of working hours to fulfil such work.<\/p> <p>  We applaud the staff in our nursing homes, HSE, private and voluntary.  These 40,000 people are on the Covid front line.  They have made sacrifices willingly, and with great commitment they continue to provide person-centred care, comfort and support.  I thank the staff in the nursing homes for the care and support provided to residents over the weeks and months, with much of it provided to residents with Covid-19.  The recent months have presented a stressful and demanding time, and these people ensured residents received excellent care in the most challenging of circumstances.<\/p> <p>  Covid-19 has presented a tragedy for nursing home residents, but it should not be lost on us that four out of every five nursing home residents who contracted Covid-19 recovered from the virus.  This is testament to the tremendous dedication and professionalism of the staff under extremely strenuous circumstances.  There needs to be a greater appreciation that care of the older person is complex.  Nurses in our nursing homes have very specific clinical expertise and a broad knowledge base founded on the science and art of the person-centred gerontological care model.<\/p> <p>  During the first three months of the year more than 2,500 people entered nursing home care under the fair deal scheme.  Every month, 1,000 people transfer from our acute hospitals into private and voluntary nursing homes.  During this national emergency, 7% of Covid cases entailed transfer of residents to hospital.  As an easily transmittable virus, we knew in early January and February it could take the lives of nursing home residents in our communities.<\/p><p>Preliminary research indicates up to 40% of transmission is passed by asymptomatic persons.  The mass testing of residents has seen asymptomatic residents and staff test positive.  Nursing homes have huge levels of experience in managing the outbreak of flu and norovirus every winter and have extensive experience, both clinical and practical, in implementing infection prevention control measures, but a global pandemic is on a different scale entirely.<\/p><p> We were exasperated in early stages and felt the sector required a very specific plan.  We knew Covid-19 had a disproportionate impact on older people.  The planning and focus was almost exclusively on our acute hospitals.  We were aware people in our nursing homes would be among the most susceptible to the virus and a national strategy and response was required.  The challenges of personal protective equipment, PPE, testing, aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff and discharges from acute hospitals are well versed at this stage.  Our decision to restrict visitors on Friday, 6 March was informed by our nursing committee, comprising clinical experts, and it was not taken lightly.  It was taken on a Friday because we were conscious of the many visitors who may have come to nursing homes that weekend.<\/p><p> Key State organisations left the nursing home sector and its residents isolated in those early days, and the dismay will live forever with us.  However, we welcome the lead of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in eventually bringing senior officials from his Department and the Health Service Executive, HSE, around the table to support the sector and our residents in coping with Covid-19.  The evidence from Ireland and internationally is no individual element of the health service can manage the global Covid-19 pandemic alone.  The supports provided by HSE community services are appreciated and have delivered valued resourcing supports to residents.<\/p><p> Covid-19 continues to live with us.  We give early welcome to the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to establish a nursing home expert panel to support good planning and safeguards to protect people who call a nursing home their home.  However, one significant voice is absent, that representing nurses from our nursing homes, who continue to operate very much on the front line.<\/p><p> Members of the Oireachtas will be aware that Nursing Homes Ireland has outlined annually a request that the Government should lead in establishing a forum on long-term care.  That call has gone unheeded for almost a decade but today we reiterate that call.  We wish to move forward but Covid-19 now lives among us.  We are actively engaged with the Minister, Deputy Harris, his officials and colleagues in the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, in presenting measures that can ease visitor restrictions in our nursing homes.  Clear policy is required and there is a requirement to balance delicately health, safety and risk to life against the mental well-being and happiness of residents.  Social connection for nursing home residents is critical.<\/p><p> Lessons can be learned from closer engagement brought upon us by Covid-19.  There is now a requirement for a better and more integrated working relationship between the State and the entire nursing home sector.  The core focus must be on meeting the complex health and social care needs of nursing home residents.  As a society, we will be stronger working together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tadhg Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":48,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for this opportunity to appear before it.  The mission of Sage Advocacy is to promote, protect and defend the rights and dignity of vulnerable adults, older people and healthcare patients.  We support and advocate for people independently of family, service provider or systems interests.  We have made a detailed submission to the committee, so in these opening remarks I want to focus on where we go from here.  We see little value in shroud waving and comparing deaths in one nursing home with another.  As Mother Jones famously stated, \"Pray for the dead and fight like hell for the living.\"<\/p> <p>  I will first give some sense of what it has been like from the perspectives of residents, relatives and staff.  \"You have no idea how awful it is &ndash; it&rsquo;s horrific.\"  These were the words of a member of staff in a nursing home that experienced a serious outbreak and many deaths.  The impact of an outbreak has been frightening for many residents, and for those with dementia, the arrival of people in full PPE was terrifying.  Serious shortages of staff meant that there was little, if any, time to provide support to residents in facilities where many died.  For families with relatives who were extremely ill or dying, the inability to visit or even to talk to their loved one by phone was a source of considerable distress and frustration.<\/p> <p>  Approximately 20% of older people need some form of support and care, of which less than 5% will live in a nursing home at any one time.  Nursing home care is not long-term care.  The average length of stay is just over two years.  In 2016, Sage Advocacy, along with other NGOs, organised a forum on long-term care for older people.<\/p><p>The unanimity of opinion at that forum was summed up in a question.  Why, despite decades of policy reports and recommendations to Government, is there still a systemic bias towards care in congregated settings and no formal legislative basis for support and care in the community?  The report of the forum spoke of the need to develop a vision for long-term support and care which is as compelling as that of the hospice movement at its best.<\/p><p> At the core of this issue is the fragmented nature of social care for older people.  This is not just about what did or did not happen in March and April.  Home support services, such as they are, are not provided on a statutory basis or regulated and have no clear vision, other than the level of home care packages that can be provided in any one year.<\/p><p> Care in nursing homes is provided on a statutory basis and is regulated, but has an overly complex and ultimately dangerous architecture.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, buys care from private providers without proper consideration of the range of needs.  The HSE administers the scheme but - this is critical - the contract is between the older person and the nursing home.  HIQA sets the standards, but has no role in setting the price, and inspects, but has no powers to investigate complaints.  Crucially, as Sage Advocacy&rsquo;s February report on medical care in nursing homes pointed out, there is no clear framework for the provision of medical care to the most vulnerable of our older people, nor are there ratios set for the level of suitably skilled nursing staff.<\/p><p> Over recent decades the State&rsquo;s approach to the residential care of older adults has been one of retreat in favour of private providers, with the remaining public facilities providing care mainly to the more frail with complex care needs, sometimes in famine era buildings.  Elements within the HSE, working with NGOs, put forward proposals for a change to a teaghleach or smaller-scale household model, but they were not supported.  The State, having outsourced the service, practised social distancing while the public, notwithstanding the good service provided by many facilities, is increasingly questioning the morality of private investment in human vulnerability.  Simply stated, we are talking of vulnerable people in a vulnerable sector. <\/p><p> Our detailed recommendations are set out in our submission.  The five I would highlight are: an integrated system of long-term support and care spanning all care situations with a single source of funding; the integration of private nursing homes into the wider framework of public health and social care; clear guidelines on the skills and level of nursing staff and medical care required in congregated care settings related to the needs of residents; a wider range of service and ownership models for homecare and care in congregated settings; and legislation for adult safeguarding and the protection of liberty in places of care and legislative recognition for independent advocacy. <\/p><p> The Covid-19 public health emergency has shown some of the great strengths of Irish society.  It has also shown weaknesses.  We have a two-tier healthcare system and a two-tier siloed approach to the long-term care and support of older people which is biased towards congregated settings.  We owe it to ourselves, and to those who have sacrificed so much, to do better.  Let us shed a tier and set about building Sl&aacute;intecare, a single-tier national health service with an integrated system of social care focused on home and a much wider range of options between home and nursing homes.

The hundreds of pieces of correspondence we received at 9.30 a.m. today indicate that, as Mr. Daly said in his opening statement, a national strategy and response was required.  The correspondence and letters from March show that Mr. Daly was begging for assistance and PPE and that, to use his words, he was pleading with the State to stop the aggressive recruitment of staff from the nursing home sector.<\/p><p>In short, it appears that nursing homes were flooded with patients and starved of staff, and yet there was no plan.  Does Mr. Daly have any idea why no plan was forthcoming, when all of the international experience would tell us that there was a need for one?

This awful pandemic has borne down heaviest on older people, particularly on those in nursing, residential and care homes.

We all realise that and it is important that we delve into it.  It is also very important that we accept that four out of every five people in nursing homes who got Covid-19 recovered and I would like to thank the 40,000 staff in nursing, care and residential homes who have gone far beyond the call of duty.<\/p> <p>  I undertook a survey between 7 April and 8 April, in which I contacted 80 nursing homes in the south of the country.  The results I got from them at that time bear out exactly what Mr. Daly said in his opening statement about the insufficient testing of residents and staff, a massive shortfall of PPE and an aggressive recruitment of nursing home staff.  I want to point out that when I conducted that survey, at a time when I was being contacted by nursing homes all over Ireland as Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for older people, 50% of the nursing homes that came back to me - and I got a 25% sample - had insufficient staff.  That bears out what Mr. Daly said about staffing.  On PPE, 30% of the nursing homes that came back to me had sufficient PPE.  This was between 8 April and 9 April when we were entering the surge.  However, 60% of the nursing homes that came back to me had no PPE and 10% had a three-day supply at that time.  That testifies to the fact that nursing homes, whether they were public or private and whether they were care homes or facilities for people with additional needs, it made no difference.  They did not have the staff during the Covid-19 pandemic and there was a shortage of PPE.  I will stand over that assertion and I have all the emails to back it up.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Daly said that Nursing Homes Ireland sought detailed Covid-19 advice from the HSE in a letter on 28 February.

I said on \"Drive Time\" before that one of my abiding memories of this crisis has been a sense of phones not being answered when a place went into crisis.  It is important to say that in Deputy Butler's own area, in the south east, they got away relatively lightly.  It was the north-east quadrant from Dublin across to Mullingar and up to Cavan that was very badly hit.  In that area, there were nights one would put one's head in one's hands.  There were people who were despairing.  They could not get through because the staffing situation was so difficult.  The nursing homes were really stuck for staff.  Some places were down to absolute skeleton staff until the cavalry came.  The fact of the matter is that they needed support.  People were literally worn out.  I think of one woman in particular who had a dying husband and a son who had lived in the same nursing home and had gone into a hospital and died.  People were literally worn out and we were almost trying to pick up the phone calls for them because they were running out of energy.  That is one of the key things.  It sounds like it has nothing to do with clinical care but one of the most important things was the lack of ability to answer the phones.  To think of a nursing home with 50 people in it, that is at least 50 families all trying to get through, and there is nobody able to answer the phone.  All sorts of stories were magnified; that is one of the problems.  It is about trying to separate fact from fiction in these situations.

As a committee we will be scrutinising that but we are dealing with facts as we get them or darter as we get them. On the staff shortages it is widely reported that the average pay in the sector would be approximately &euro;12 per hour for health assistance. Do the witnesses think this has had an impact on the staffing levels and the ability to attract staff. In nursing homes Ireland has had its own campaign recruitment campaign since 17 March which would indicate that has not been successful. I know Mr Daley says the HSE aggressive in its recruitment campaign but does he think the nursing homes Ireland structure in terms of pay for health staff has been a factor in this. Clearly the sector is as I said earlier the most highly regulated and from a standard point of view but it is also regulated from a price point of view. The National treatment purchase fund said the fees and the fees then in turn dictate the pay scales with in this sector. We would love nothing better in the morning than to be on the same rates as the HSE but the state is not providing that level despite of the fact being of the fair deal being a level playing field. And off a lot of figures are being thrown around in regard to the industry. As was said at the start it goes from the voluntary right through to large corporate's are involved. Given there has been an issue in terms of being prepared for this across the state would Mr Daley considered the setting up of a pandemic or crisis formed with the in nursing home sector that he represents a sort of sinking formed into the future for those that can pay that they would pay into something so there would be a fond so that if a second or further wave of this crisis comes it could be drawn upon and those few weeks that were spent with the HSE getting responses and not getting responses would not have too be such a huge issue because there would be that reserve available. That would come from the nursing home's own resources. Quite possibly. But the issue was not finance at all. The issue was PPE generally which just was not available. Members were sourcing it they were buying at overseas and buying locally. Finance was not the issue and let us be absolutely clear on that. The issue was that it was a scarce commodity in an international market and the source of supply had dried up not just for nursing home sport for all elements of the health service. Money must be an issue because there is now &euro;72 million support package of which the nursing homes have drawn down &euro;8.7 million. So money is an issue. The point I am making is that it was not an issue in terms of preparedness because people had spent and I can get some of those figures for the Deputy in terms of what members had spent in March. The point Deputy Porter made was that the scheme is from 1 April whereas in fact members would have spent quite considerable sums in March which are not potentially re-coop a bill under the temporary financial assistance scheme. I thank Mr Daly. I think both of our witnesses for their presentations. Any examination of what has happened in the nursing homes must be viewed in a policy context for them there is no doubt bereaved families and our society generally are paying a very high price for what I would regard as the confluence of policy failures in the care of older people. Which have been graphically and tragically exposed over recent months. It is important that we bear in mind what those policy failures are. The first is the two tier health service the second is in regard to social care being treated as the poor relation of the health service the third is the fact nursing homes are regarded as a good investment opportunity as opposed to a central element of the healthcare service and the incentivise nation of investment in nursing homes has led to the unrelenting privatisation of the sector. The fact that older people themselves are incentivised to access nursing home care because of the lack of statutory entitlement to home care in spite of the home care is what older people want and what it is is in their best health needs. The fifth the area that has been absolutely exposed is the light-touch regulation of this entire sector. I recognise that Deputy O'Dowd had to leave but I would make the point to Deputy Oand others government members that those points have to be made loudly as well and must be heard clearly. We are wasting our time examining that this whole area on lets we recognise that policy context and those policy failures. I have a number of questions for Mr Daly.

Any examination of what has happened in the nursing homes must be viewed in a policy context.  There is no doubt bereaved families and Irish society generally are paying a very high price for what I would regard as a confluence of policy failures in the care of older people which have been graphically and tragically exposed over recent months.  It is important that we bear in mind what those policy failures are.  The first is the two-tier health service.  The second is in regard to social care being treated as the poor relation of the health service.  The third is the fact that nursing homes are regarded as a good investment opportunity, as opposed to a central element of the healthcare service, and that the incentivisation of investment in nursing homes has led to the unrelenting privatisation of the sector.  The fourth is the fact that older people themselves are incentivised to access nursing home care because of the lack of statutory entitlement to home care, in spite of the fact that home care is what older people want and is in the best interests of their health needs.  The fifth area that has been absolutely exposed is the light-touch regulation of this entire sector.<\/p> <p>  I recognise that Deputy O'Dowd had to leave.  I would make the point to Deputy O'Dowd and other Government Deputies that those points have to be made loudly as well and must be heard clearly.

The Deputy has since left the meeting but I point out to the remaining Government members that the reason for that is that we have gone from having a nursing home sector that was majority publicly owned 35 years ago to one which is overwhelmingly privately owned.

I acknowledge the phenomenal and committed work of individuals in the sector who have worked really hard.  I have stayed in touch with those in my area and last week we raised the issue of testing and tracing.  I will be raising a significant matter that arises with respect to insurance but Mr. Daly is representing Nursing Homes Ireland, a representative body of for-profit and private nursing homes.  Deputy O'Dowd has, over the course of his career, expressed concerns about how older people are cared for.  The purpose of this committee is to assess the State response, and as Mr. Daly indicated, it is one of the most important analyses that may be conducted.  It is in that vein that I wish to interrogate some of the matters raised by Mr. Daly.<\/p><p>The most important statement made by Mr. Daly, both here and in the media over the past couple of days, is that the sector felt isolated in early March, that this was distressing and that there was a lack of engagement.  I will go through this as we now have the benefit of the correspondence between the Department and Nursing Homes Ireland.  I apologise if this is dull but it is important to be careful.<\/p><p>Going back to the beginning of the year, there were two items of correspondence, with one relating to insurance and a second concerning a former Deputy, Mr. Jim Daly, who was not running for re-election.  The correspondence of 28 February related to a call of thanks with respect to guidance on Covid-19.  From 28 February onwards, there was very significant engagement on a daily and often multiple times daily.  This was at assistant secretary level with Dr. Kathleen MacLellan.  It is important because of what the witness said to go through some of the correspondence and I will give Mr. Daly the opportunity to respond at the end.  Correspondence from the Department on 2 March states: &quot;Thank you for your email.  We continue to ensure members are appropriately informed.&quot;.  The reply from Dr. MacLellan states: &quot;Tadhg, many thanks for keeping me updated.&quot;  I imagine some in the media will go through this correspondence but it is important for the committee's purpose for it to be done.  On 4 March Dr. MacLellan wrote:<\/p> <blockquote> \tTadhg,<br \/><br \/>... Yes I can confirm that there [are] a number of subgroups being established under NPHET.  I will be chairing the Vulnerable People subgroup <\/blockquote> <p>Dr. MacLellan is the assistant secretary in the social care division and she indicates that she is chairing that subgroup and is the primary point of correspondence with Nursing Homes Ireland.

The Government's Covid action plan for mid-March refers to nursing homes only once as somewhere to send hospital patients.  The plan makes no reference to any supports or risks that need to be examined for nursing homes.  Mr. Daly has said that the first time he managed to get a meeting with the Minister was 30 March, when we were well into the crisis in the nursing homes.  The first time the National Public Health Emergency Team even mentioned nursing homes in its minutes was in the minutes for its 12th meeting on 10 March.  Its recommendation was that the restrictions that the nursing homes themselves had put in place should be relaxed.  The National Public Health Emergency Team therefore held two positions in the same week: one, that schools should all close, and two, that nursing homes should be more open, which I find absolutely extraordinary.  Would representation on the National Public Health Emergency Team and closer contact with senior officials and Cabinet have made a difference?  The Minister's position, which he has outlined repeatedly to me, is that HIQA, the regulator, represents nursing homes at the table.  Do the witnesses believe HIQA can represent nursing homes at the table?  Critically, looking forward, do the witnesses believe that nursing home residents and staff and older people have a sufficient voice now, be it on the National Public Health Emergency Team, in senior policy settings, in senior HSE areas or at a senior political level, in order that we can properly prepare for the potential second wave which may come and make sure we do not see these outbreaks and tragic deaths occur again in our nursing homes, and indeed for older people in other settings?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#Y01300","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":411,"content":"<p>Regarding representation, yes, I believe having a voice for the sector, whether a nurse working on the front line, staff working in the sector or indeed older people themselves, on NPHET would have made a difference because it would have raised the issues on the agenda.<\/p><p>The Deputy pointed out that the first discussion was on 12 March.

One of the things that led us to develop this work, in which we collaborated with Nursing Home Ireland and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, was our concern that it was unclear what the clinical leadership is in nursing homes, particularly in private nursing homes.  Some residents are being charged &euro;25 and others &euro;40 a week for a GP service when the fact of the matter is that they should be entitled to this anyway because of their age.  In some places there would be a very good structure while in others it would be very difficult for GPs to come in.  I want to quote very briefly from this report:<\/p> <blockquote> \tThe point was made that nursing home staff may not have the exposure, experience and training available in acute hospitals.  It was also suggested that skills sets of nurses working in nursing homes may have gone down in recent years with a concomitant fear of making decisions in potentially crisis situations. <\/blockquote> <p>The difficulty here is that if a nurse needs support and there is not strong clinical support, then there is a real weakness in the system, and there has to be clinical leadership.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#AA00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mervyn Taylor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>It is important to put on the record that the nurses in the nursing home sector are very well qualified and caring professionals with deep gerontological experience.

From the onset of this public health emergency, HIQA has endeavoured to make an effective contribution to the national response through our interactions with the Department of Health, the HSE, providers, residents and relatives. While routine inspections were not initially possible, HIQA has a process in place whereby all centres are formally contacted by an inspector on a regular basis to assess how they are managing in the provision of safe services to vulnerable service users.  In addition, the chief inspector issued eight regulatory notices with the aim of reducing the regulatory burden on providers. <\/p> <p>  Inspections required to register new centres or facilitate increasing capacity have been expedited within days.  HIQA has provided information to the Department of Health and the HSE on those centres with a history of poor compliance with key regulations, as those services were at increased risk of Covid-19 outbreaks. <\/p> <p>  Formal processes are in place whereby HIQA escalates actual or potential risk to the HSE&rsquo;s crisis management teams.  On a weekly basis, the chief inspector and her leadership team meet the HSE to formally discuss ongoing issues and to escalate risk within the sector. <\/p> <p>  To support the public health response, HIQA provided the HSE with key information such as the locations of nursing homes, the number of residential beds and staffing levels.  Furthermore, the HSE and the Department of Health availed of HIQA&rsquo;s online notification system to ensure the timely distribution of information to all nursing homes.<\/p> <p>  Currently, 80% of nursing homes are operated by private providers.  Although funded through the nursing homes support scheme, the HSE did not know this sector.  As a consequence, the infrastructure required by the HSE to support the private sector was under-resourced and became increasingly challenged.  In addition, the current model of private residential care for older persons has no formal clinical governance links with the HSE.  Importantly, this means there is no national clinical oversight of the care being delivered to some of our most vulnerable citizens. <\/p> <p>  Many nursing homes and disability centres were adequately prepared and managed to contain Covid-19 outbreaks.  However, the private nursing home sector faced unique challenges.  For example: timely testing and results; access to sustainable levels of PPE, oxygen and subcutaneous fluids; and baseline staff numbers, including senior nursing expertise in infection prevention and control. <\/p> <p>  In recognition of the difficulties faced by the providers of residential services, HIQA initiated a number of interventions from 5 March.  These included the escalation to the HSE and the Department of Health of risks and trends requiring a more co-ordinated national response.  On 18 March, HIQA made a formal offer to assist the HSE in liaising with designated centres.  This was in recognition of the fact that there was no established relationship between the HSE and the private sector. <\/p> <p>  Every day HIQA collates data on the number of designated centres with suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19, as well as the numbers of unexpected deaths in designated centres.  Since the end of March, this information has been supplied on a daily basis to the Department of Health initially, and then to the HSE and the HPSC. <\/p> <p>  From 1 April, HIQA requested a formal escalation pathway for a more strategic co-ordinated approach to the supply of PPE, resident and staff testing and results, a longer-term approach to staffing and infection control advice. <\/p> <p>  To provide support and assistance to providers and staff, HIQA established an infection prevention and control hub on 6 April.  HIQA continues to review information received from members of the public, care staff and family members.<\/p><p>It must be acknowledged that the creation of crisis management teams in each CHO area and the resources provided by the HSE at the community level played a significant part in supporting the private sector, and importantly, in protecting residents.  COVID-19 has presented significant challenges to the current models of care in place for our older citizens.  Since our establishment, HIQA has endeavoured to influence policy in the area of older persons&rsquo; services based on our experience of the sector.<\/p><p> HIQA believes that the quality and safety of our health and social care services would be greatly improved by a review of the current regulatory framework and the introduction of an accountability framework, to include a commissioning model.  As part of an accountability framework, HIQA believes that a system of care management could be introduced across the HSE&rsquo;s community service areas.  Such a model would closely align with the principles and goals articulated within Sl&aacute;intecare, as the key aim of the system is to support people in, or as close to their own homes as possible.  These care plans are based on a multidisciplinary assessment and would enable a sustained shift away from institutional models towards a more person-centred system whereby care is provided in the home.

It is an appalling vista which is brought about by the nature of the virus itself.  I also acknowledge the tremendous work of all our health service people, workers in nursing homes, care assistants, cleaners and people who help out in every way.  These people do fantastic work, often for very poor wages and without proper recognition.<\/p> <p>  I have met Mr. Quinn and communicated with him.  I have appealed some of his decisions to the Information Commissioner in the past, in an effort to get transparency around the care of people in nursing homes.  I wrote to him on Tuesday, 24 March seeking an entitlement which I believe the people had at the time and still have, namely, a categoric assurance from HIQA that all nursing homes and care homes are fully compliant in infection control.  The reason I wrote the letter was the HIQA report to which I referred earlier, which indicated that, at the time, only 123 of the 581 nursing homes subject to HIQA inspection met in full all of the regulations.  I did not get that commitment from Mr. Quinn.  While I note what he is saying here today, as I understand it, he has to be accountable.  The office of the HIQA chief inspector has statutory responsibility for the registration and inspection of nursing homes and other residential services for children and adults with disabilities.  As part of its remit, HIQA can inspect nursing homes and make binding decisions relative to the safety and quality of care provided to residents following inspection.  That is the statutory power HIQA has.  I note Mr. Quinn's call for additional powers, with which I do not disagree.  Why was Mr. Quinn not able to give that categoric assurance to me and, more importantly, to all of the residents that all of the homes they were living in were fully compliant in infection control?  Clearly, we both know they were not.  That is my first question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#OO00300","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":447,"content":"<p>If it is okay with the Deputy, I will pass to my colleague, Ms Mary Dunnion, chief inspector.

In 2019, which are probably the more up-to-date figures, 238 inspections included regulation 27, which is the one particular to infection control.  Of these 238 inspections, 20 cases were not compliant and a significant number were only substantially compliant.  There are several reasons for this.  The national standards for community centres called for a national integrated approach to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.  To date, this is not in place.  On the rare occurrences when outbreaks of winter vomiting and influenza occur these procedures are effective but the national standards are not able to deal with the case of a pandemic.<\/p> <p>  One of the big issues that makes centres not compliant is the premises.

I have not seen the figures.  I am glad Ms Dunnion has given them to me.<\/p> <p>  There is a particular problem when nursing homes are inspected and major or minor non-compliance is found and I will use a particular nursing home as an example but I will not name it.  This particular nursing home was inspected in March 2019 and the report was published in July 2019 but the follow up inspection was not until December 2019 and that report was published in March 2020.  There was a year between the first inspection with negative outcomes and the report of the follow up inspection which, in this case, appeared to show compliance.  Without going into the details, this nursing home was non-compliant with regard to health and social care, safeguarding and safety, residents' rights and dignity and suitable staffing.  Its complaints procedure is compliant.  Notwithstanding all of the powers HIQA has, the process of inspection and follow-up does not seem to be working as quickly as it ought to be.  I appreciate that follow-up is part of the process but it is not fast enough or good enough.<\/p> <p>  There is no change in the figures we have.  The majority of nursing homes are not compliant.  In this crisis HIQA is statutorily accountable.  I do not suggest it is passing the buck to anybody else, and I agree it includes other agencies, but ultimately the buck stop with it.  As an inspectorate, does HIQA require more staff?  The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong but the figure in its most recent report was that 76% of nursing homes were inspected last year as opposed to 100%.  If HIQA does not have enough staff to investigate, look at, help and support private and public nursing homes it cannot do its job.  Does HIQA need more powers?  It seems that non-compliance can drag on and on.  I do not agree there is a difference between major and minor infractions.  By definition, a nursing home should be 100% compliant.  Does HIQA need more powers to ensure this happens?  A huge part of this is not just finding what are the issues but training and making available to public and private nursing homes the professional capacity to upskill all of their staff.  It is good enough finding fault in one sense but if people do not upskill an inspector cannot be there 24-7.<\/p> <p>  We have had a serious problem with a private nursing home in Dundalk where there has been an awful lot of sadness and upset at the terrible outcome for so many people in a very short space of time.<\/p><p>It seems there was a situation whereby out of a total of 24 professional staff, particularly nurses, only six were available to maintain that nursing home because of illness and absence for other reasons.  Given that we are in this sort of crisis, not just nationally but internationally, does HIQA, in the context of its investigations, have the power to seek information from the nursing home, from the HSE and from others in order to get to the bottom of what happened and give closure to the families in Dundalk that are so distressed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#PP00800","speaker":"1598","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":461,"content":"<p>I will reply, in the first instance, to the Deputy&rsquo;s question on powers.

Mr. Quinn went on to speak about the current model of private residential care having no formal clinical governance links with the HSE, which is really extraordinary.

It is not a failure of any one body - Nursing Homes Ireland, HIQA, the HSE or the Department - but at its heart it is a gigantic political failure to act in the interests of our elderly people.  Since the late 1980s we have been privatising the care of the elderly.  It was described by the Ombudsman in a 2010 report as a creeping move towards privatisation that has now become a gallop.  We have a reversal of what we had in the 1980s today, with 80% of nursing homes in the private sector and 20% in the public sector.

They are possibly for HIQA or the HSE.  Maybe a written answer for one or two of them might suffice.<\/p> <p>  My first question relates to nursing homes and personal protective equipment availability.  I understand gowns are still a particular issue for several nursing homes.  There also appears to be confusion regarding the use of PPE in certain sections and nursing homes, especially over where and when it should be used.  This is informally coming back from some nursing homes managers.  Have the authorities issued any guidance aside from what came out earlier on in the engagement?<\/p> <p>  I have a question on staffing, especially in respect of healthcare staff who are deemed vulnerable or at risk.  Again, there appears to be confusion in terms of those who are vulnerable.  They are basically told to isolate at home.  Others who have been exposed to Covid-19 patients are at risk.  Maybe this needs to be clarified nationally to nursing home managers.<\/p> <p>  I brought up another issue in the D&aacute;il some weeks ago.  It still has not been addressed by the HSE.  Why are senior nurse managers in nursing homes not allowed to take swab tests and present them to the local care setting?  I know in Waterford at present we have been successfully using the University Hospital Waterford south east regional pathology laboratory.  We are turning around swab tests in less than 24 hours.  It seems we have to send out National Ambulance Service personnel to take swabs.  Why are we doing that when we have qualified people in-house to do it?  Maybe someone could answer that.<\/p> <p>  The HSE has supplied accommodation relief for healthcare workers who are living together.  This was not extended to nursing home personnel.  They have to meet these challenges themselves.  Does either the HSE or HIQA have thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  I want to ask HIQA about nursing home inspections.  My understanding is that the authority has been engaged in desktop reviews for quite a period and that authority staff have visited the facilities.  I believe any further reviews should be done by way of desktop review.  We should not have inspectors coming in or transiting in and out of nursing homes unless the authority has a specific concern backed up by a complaint.<\/p> <p>  In one of the opening statements, a HIQA inspector stated that significant facilities are the point of failure, in other words, the infrastructure on-site.  Has HIQA any plans to support policy to allow some mandating of capital by Government to allow these systems to be rectified?

It seems clear given the scale of clusters, outbreaks and fatalities in nursing homes that opportunities were missed to support the nursing homes and prevent contagion into them.  Various vectors into the nursing homes have been discussed today, including staff being discharged from hospitals, for example.  I believe one of the reasons is that nursing homes and older people have had no voice in the room where the decisions are being taken, which is the National Public Health Emergency Team.  I have put this to the Minister for Health repeatedly in the D&aacute;il and he has repeatedly told me that nursing homes do have a voice and HIQA is their voice.  The Minister's formal position is that HIQA is the voice of nursing homes on NPHET.  We have a limited number of minutes from NPHET meetings but on 30 January, the second meeting, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  On 4 February, the third meeting, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the fourth meeting on 11 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the fifth meeting on 18 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  On the eighth meeting on 25 February, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the ninth meeting on 3 March, HIQA was present and nursing homes were not discussed.  At the 12th meeting, on 10 March, HIQA was present and nursing homes were discussed.  The action that was agreed was that the unilateral restriction of visiting to nursing homes was not required at that time.  At the same meeting, NPHET agreed that we needed to look seriously at closing all of the schools in the country because the outbreak had become so severe.  Within 36 hours, it made that recommendation and the Taoiseach implemented it two and a half days later.  If HIQA has been the voice of nursing homes on NPHET, and given that it has clearly been at all of the meetings, why did it never raise the crisis that was emerging in nursing homes?  When the crisis was finally raised, why did HIQA stand over a decision that visitor restrictions were unnecessary which the nursing homes had put in place themselves because they were aware that there was a crisis?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#FFF01000","speaker":"1623"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":686,"content":"<p>The Deputy is quite correct in that HIQA was invited onto NPHET quite early on.

It has a remit for the regulation of health and social care services in Ireland, which includes our healthcare services, adult social care services, children's services, health technology assessment and standards development.  It was from that perspective that it was my understanding that HIQA was being invited onto NPHET.  I would appreciate that there has not been reference within the minutes in respect of nursing homes.  However, I am also aware that on 4 March there was a specific sub-group of NPHET set up to look at vulnerable people, which would have included the nursing home sector.  Colleagues from HIQA were at that point nominated onto that group.  I believe it is from that point as well that HIQA played a very significant role in providing information, data and a number of other sources that dealt with the way in which we were looking at nursing homes, perceiving the problems within the nursing home sector and also how we at that point started to support that sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#FFF01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Phelim Quinn"},{"type":"speech","time":1590447600,"counter":687,"content":"<p>Given that HIQA has said the HSE has stated it does not understand the private nursing home sector, it is fair to think the Department of Health does not either as it is a further step removed.

With regard to the staffing issue, it is not in anybody's interest for one sector to deprive another sector of staffing.  Clearly, there are going to be major issues to be addressed as a result of this in terms of governance and resilience in general within the private nursing home sector, in particular a need for them to reflect on their own staffing issues and possibly the issues that arise in terms of short-term contracts and the security they themselves can give to those staff.<\/p> <p>  To move on to the Deputy's question with regard to the transfers, again, the big learning has been around the fact that asymptomatic transmission was not a feature of WHO or ECDC guidance until 18 March and the guidance we had been issuing around the end of February and in early March did not reflect that.  In fact, if we look at the WHO guidance, it indicated &ldquo;possible&rdquo; asymptomatic transmission, so everybody was still rigorously applying a case definition that was based on people having symptoms.  When these patients were moved, they were not tested on the basis they did not have symptoms.<\/p> <p>  The other key piece was that if staff coming in from the community to work in these care settings did not have symptoms, they were not being tested either.  We have learned a lot from the mass testing exercise in that regard.  Clearly, the guidance we will be issuing to revisit that will look substantially different on the basis of the learning we have had in terms of that testing piece.<\/p> <p>  I would like to reiterate it is not the case that testing gives a definitive result where Covid is concerned.  People can be Covid-negative today and Covid-positive tomorrow.  That is the nature of the condition itself, particularly in the pre-symptomatic phase.  It is also the case that we know that about 20% of patients who test as negative or not detected for Covid may actually develop symptoms in the following 14-day period.  For that reason, all of these transfers were advised to be isolated and monitored for a 14-day period because these are our best safeguards. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#HHH00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kennelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1590447600,"counter":699,"content":"<p>I want to reiterate the second part of the question.

That is how quickly things have been evolving in this pandemic.  We know we had testing of asymptomatic residents in our mass testing exercise, which took place on 14 April.  It is very difficult to say because we do not know what the mortality looks like in terms of patients who have tested positive but who were asymptomatic.

Equally, with regard to the nursing homes that were hit by Covid-19, it was not just peculiar or particular to nursing homes and it is what we are living with currently.  There needs to be balance in the whole discussion.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Butler put it superbly when she acknowledged that in any crisis situation, the measure will be what we learn from it.  In that respect, I would like to point to the fact there was quite an amount of confusion and lack of clarity at the outset as to how things were operating within the nursing homes.  Nursing homes were told that patients were to remain in nursing homes and not be transferred to hospitals yet, at the same time, patients were being discharged from hospitals and brought to nursing home settings without testing.  All of that confusion did not help the situation.<\/p><p>Equally, it is my understanding that on 14 April the HSE informed HIQA that due to difficulties in sourcing PPE it would not be possible to provide the three day baseline for PPE, as promised, and PPE would be directed to those areas termed greatest risk.  On that particular date, 14 April, the number of clusters in nursing homes had risen to 158.  There was a litany of confusion and lack of clarity but going forward, and I have discussed this with a number of nursing homes in my own constituency, is there an ongoing commitment from the HSE to provide PPE or is there a cut-off date?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#HHH00600","speaker":"1582","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":703,"content":"<p>The HSE is committed to providing PPE and as the CEO said, probably at this committee last week, we are looking at a probable total commitment over a 12 month period of in excess of &euro;1 billion across all sectors.  To date across private nursing homes, the HSE has provided in or around &euro;27 million worth of PPE and millions of items.  At this time there is no suggestion whatsoever that is going to cease.  If anything, as more need is identified, it is met.  That being said, in discussions with Nursing Homes Ireland we have encouraged it to continue to explore its own sources because more is better.  Until such time as we can not only meet demand but begin to accumulate stock to provide a buffer, I do not think any of us will be satisfied on the overall position regarding PPE.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#JJJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1590447600,"counter":704,"content":"<p>I welcome that.  A point raised with me by a number of nursing homes is the current position where if a patient has to be transferred to a hospital for a minor procedure - it may well be an X-ray, a cardiac issue or a pacemaker or a defibrillator check - on return to the nursing home, even though he or she might have only been on the hospital campus for an hour or two, he or she is expected to go into 14 day isolation.  That adds considerable trauma for the individual, families, and the nursing home.  Nursing homes are now making the decision on what is most urgent so that people might or might not attend hospital.  Is there a better way of doing things going forward?  Is it possible services may be made available at nursing home sites rather than people having to go to hospital?  Is there an opportunity for learning there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CRS2020052600002#JJJ00300","speaker":"1582"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1590447600,"counter":705,"content":"<p>As we speak, guidance around all of that is being revisited to give clarity.

It is important to reiterate that.<\/p> <p>  On those short-term visits the Deputy is talking about, the feeling is that anything that can be done in a short period does not require isolation afterwards.  Again, it is important that people understand the role that asymptomatic transmission and the potential for asymptomatic transmission play in this.  Clearly, people who need overnight or more prolonged stays will require isolation on transfer back.  That will all be addressed.  It is important to note everything that is happening is being monitored on a close basis by our colleagues.
