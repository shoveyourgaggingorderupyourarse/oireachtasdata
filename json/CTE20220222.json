On 15 December last year, the Commission published a legislative proposal to replace an existing 2008 directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.  The Commission evaluated the 2008 directive during 2019 and 2020 and published the results of the evaluation in October 2020.<\/p> <p>  The Commission found that the 2008 directive had little effect in practice.  The number of environmental crime cases investigated and prosecuted was still very low in the Commission's opinion.  Penalties were considered to be too lenient to discourage environmental crimes and there was too little co-operation between member states in enforcing these laws.  In addition, the Commission noted very little information on investigations was being gathered.<\/p> <p>  The Commission proposes to address these issues by introducing a new, expanded and reinforced directive, replacing the 2008 directive, on the protection of the environment through criminal law.  This new directive will clarify the definitions of existing criminal offences and define nine new environmental offences.  These are: placement on the market of products that cause substantial damage to the environment because of the products' use on larger scale; serious breaches of EU chemicals legislation causing substantial damage to the environment or human health; illegal ship recycling; illegal water abstraction; source discharge of polluting substances from ships; illegal trade in timber; serious breaches of rules on the introduction and spread of invasive alien species within the Union; serious circumvention of requirements to do an environmental impact assessment; and illegal production, placing on the market, import, export, use, emission or release of fluorinated greenhouse gases.  The proposal would define sanction types and levels for environmental crimes, improve cross-border co-operation and investigation, ensure better data collection and sharing of statistics and improve the effectiveness of national enforcement chains.<\/p> <p>  Many of the issues raised by this proposal concern criminal law and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is working closely with the Department of Justice as this proposal is examined by the Council of Ministers.  The proposal will be considered by the working party on judicial co-operation in criminal matters, COPEN, formation of the Council, which brings together justice officials from member states.  Other Departments will also be concerned with sector-specific matters relating to agriculture, water, industry and transport.<\/p> <p>  In terms of implications for Ireland, we view the next ten years to be critical if we are to address the climate and biodiversity crises which threaten our safe future on this planet.  It is imperative that we protect our biodiversity and natural heritage against deliberate acts of systematic destruction of ecosystems, both nationally and globally.  Tackling environmental crime is also a key commitment under the EU's Green Deal.  This proposal includes robust measures that will define sanction types and levels for environmental crimes, improve cross-border co-operation, ensure better data collection and sharing of statistics and improve the effectiveness of national enforcement chains, including our own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finnegan for his statement.

The new criminal offences defined would criminalise activities in breach of environmental legislation that would harm ecosystems and biodiversity.<\/p><p>With regard to the sanctions and criminalisation, the picture the Commission found was that while authorities were in place in member states to police the existing crimes, this was ineffective because co-operation between them was not effective.  Therefore, the view of the Commission is that by improving co-operation between member states, prosecutorial and investigative activity will be much more effective.  The Commission draws attention to the fact that the definitions of the crimes before 2008 were different in different member states.  Some member states did not define them as crimes.  It was found in the evaluation that the directive gave enough discretion such that the definitions were still different, and this caused difficulties, including practical difficulties, in cross-border investigations.  Since the definitions and sanctions were different, it was not even possible to use legal machinery such as the European arrest warrant.  The reasoning behind what was proposed was that by tightening the definition of the crimes, expanding the list of crimes and harmonising the sanctions, the existing investigative activity would be much more effective.  This was because people could co-operate between member states.  Obviously, environmental damage does not respect member state borders.  In the Commission's view, which seems reasonable, investigations have to cross borders as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Mr. Finnegan is saying EU cross-border co-operation will be more effective.

Mr. Finnegan mentioned better co-operation between national authorities.  Domestic co-operation also seems to be key.  In that context, Mr. Finnegan mentioned co-operation between the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Justice.  In fairness to the Minister of State responsible for heritage, Deputy Noonan, he has pushed the idea of the wildlife crime unit.  The Ministry responsible for heritage would seem to comprise another key point.  What are the plans to ensure those elements intersect?<\/p> <p>  Let me refer to an issue in which I am very interested.  I do not believe we need to wait for the directive to come into place to assume there is a problem, that is, the serious circumnavigation of the requirement to make an environmental impact assessment.  Ireland has an extremely poor record on conducting environmental impact assessments and constantly seems to be coming up with new reasons as to why we do not need to conduct them.<\/p> <p>  With regard to resources and capacity, how has the capacity increased over the past year or two?  What are the plans to increase it in respect of environmental impact assessments, including in respect of the public's capacity to support them?  This has come up in multiple areas, including forestry.<\/p> <p>  There are two points that I noted.  Mr. Finnegan mentioned deliberate acts.  I was a little concerned when I heard that.  Could Mr. Finnegan clarify that it is not the Irish position that one has to prove bad intent?  An act that is the result of negligence still has the same bad environmental impact as a deliberate act.  Indeed, the precautionary principle under EU law and practice under the treaties implies it is about due care being taken.  Could Mr. Finnegan comment on how the precautionary principle is likely to be reflected in our approach to the directive?  Could he clarify that it is not solely deliberate acts but also acts that come about through negligence that he believes might be covered?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#C00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

She made a very good point on the need for internal co-operation on both scrutiny and execution.  This is because each of the nine new offences will require the expertise of other Departments for scrutiny.  It is to ensure that the directive reaches its best possible form and that there is co-operation in enforcing it.<\/p> <p>  The first offence is the placement on the market of products that, in breach of mandatory requirements, cause substantial damage to the environment because of their use on a larger scale.  The existing requirements that limit the use of certain materials are the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are often enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, so we will have to scrutinise the provision with it.  It would have to take a leading role in this.  That is a good example of the structure in that the standards are in existing legislation &mdash; in this case, in the REACH directives and other measures on the use of chemicals and other raw materials in manufacturing.  Certain things are forbidden on a civil or EU law basis.  The directive under discussion does not change that standard; it just states certain egregious breaches of the existing standards will become a criminal offence.<\/p> <p>  The second new offence concerns serious breaches of chemicals legislation.  Again, the existing standards, which are just being reinforced, will need to be scrutinised by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the other existing stakeholders.<\/p> <p>  The third offence relates to ship recycling.  There is existing legislation setting standards for the recycling of ships.  It is the responsibility of my Department.  We will have to examine closely the effects of imposing criminal sanctions for serious breaches.  <\/p> <p>  The fourth offence concerns water abstraction and makes abstraction a criminal offence if it causes substantial damage.  Again, this would have to be considered by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is responsible for existing legislation related to water and which would have primary responsibility for enforcement.<\/p> <p>  The fifth new offence, on the discharge of polluting substances from ships, will require scrutiny by the Department of Transport, which would have to be involved in enforcement.<\/p> <p>  The sixth, on placing illegally harvested timber on the EU market, would obviously require the scrutiny of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which would have to take a leading role.<\/p> <p>  The seventh concerns serious breaches of rules concerning invasive species.  This and other biodiversity matters are the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As the Senator mentioned, there are provisions to criminalise a failure to carry out proper environmental impact assessments in certain circumstances.  That is part of our planning system.  There are existing standards in this regard that are the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and various bodies under its aegis.<\/p> <p>  The ninth offence primarily concerns my Department.  The change made means that the release of fluoridated greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will become a criminal offence.  The Senator made the very good point that this legislation will require whole-of-government scrutiny to ensure it works properly and whole-of-government action to enforce it.<\/p> <p>  The subject of environmental impact assessments is controversial, as the Senator suggested.  We will be discussing with our colleagues who are responsible for that aspect of the planning system the best and most appropriate way to add criminal sanctions in a helpful way.  I am afraid I cannot help the Senator very much with the details of the system and how it is currently working, but I am sure we can return to that.  Colleagues in the responsible Department can answer specific questions on the current system.<\/p> <p>  The Senator raised a very interesting question that has been raised by member states.  It concerns the distinction between a deliberate act and a negligent act.  My colleague the attach&eacute; may join in on this.  In summary, there have already been two days of discussion on the directive, at the end of last month.  The first three articles were gone through.  Exactly the kinds of questions being discussed have been raised.  For example, is the definition of \"unlawful\" in the directive appropriate?<\/p><p>Is there a need for <i>mens rea<\/i>for something to be a criminal act?  What should the distinction be between deliberate and negligent acts?  What is the standard for negligence?  These are very technical and very important legal principles, and we are working with the Department of Justice to ensure that what is implemented works well in our system.  Certainly, the intention of the directive as it stands is that it covers deliberate acts and negligent acts.  It covers natural persons and legal persons.  What is needed now is the technical scrutiny to ensure the directive has its intended effect in a common law jurisdiction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#C00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Ryan wish to come in on this question from Brussels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#D00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will add to Mr. Finnegan's comments.

Recognising that the European legal system is slightly different from ours, we have to analyse and study the effects of this.  We are not alone here.  The member states are also querying exactly what has been proposed in these definitions and are looking for clarity.

The concept of environmental crime has not been treated very seriously in this country in recent years and that is why it is so important that directives like this are.  This leads into my first question.  Does the Department believe, in the context of other European countries, their standard of environmental law is substandard or poor?  Is that why a directive like this is needed for member states across the European Continent?<\/p> <p>  I refer to improving cross-Border co-operation.  I come from Dundalk, a Border area.  The most significant environmental crimes that I have seen in my eight years of politics is fuel laundering and the dumping of illegal toxic sludge, not only on our roadways but in our rivers and lakes, which I have physically seen, of Border areas.  That has actually decreased in recent years because of the dye and other measures we have introduced as a way of combating it.  However, it is still an extremely serious issue in the part of the world from where I come.  If possible, that is an area we need to focus on.  I would love to hear more detail.  I know it may be difficult to give details now because it is at an early stage, but it would be important to get more detail on what we can do in terms of cross-Border co-operation, particularly when going from a member state, the Republic of Ireland, into Northern Ireland which is no longer in the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Who would be the enforcement authority of this?  Will it be done on a cross-sectoral basis?  Will it be the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Justice?  Who will be the enforcement people of this?<\/p> <p>  Finally, I have a quick question, a basic one.  Will the Department give a rough outline of the timeframe involved in this directive from start to finish and when can we expect to see it being implemented?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#D01000","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>I am reluctant to characterise any member state's environmental regime as being substandard.  The Commission carefully, in its extensive review, did not criticise any member state's system.  The point it made, and it is the basis for all of this, is that they differ.  We are in a situation where if the system differs in its definition of crimes or even in its sanctions, it is operationally very difficult for people to co-operate.  One can imagine the sort of co-operation involved.  The Senator raised a very good local example of it.  The Commission is aiming to create that standardisation whereby, operationally, everybody is aiming for the same thing and that the legal mechanisms that already exist for arrest warrants and searches and so on can be triggered.<\/p> <p>  It is also worth saying that although the Commission does not criticise any individual member state, it has said that harmonisation does not just allow co-operation.  It said that where there are differences in levels of criminal enforcement and definitions of crime, there is a danger of creating safe havens.  It does not name names.  This is theoretical.  There is, at least in theory, a danger of areas of lesser enforcement, thereby creating safe havens, unfair competition, distorting trade, and penalising the good actors who, in good faith, try to follow these regulations and rules.<\/p><p> On the co-operation issue, our understanding of this proposal at this stage is that it is the type of measure that is intended to deal with that.  Washing diesel and dumping the residue breaches any number of existing rules and there are a similar number of civil penalties.  People can be forced to stop doing that and clean it up.  This would go further in providing that, in certain circumstances, that becomes a crime.  What we need to do in the scrutiny of this proposal is to set out what happens in our jurisdiction and produce a workable set of definitions and language for this directive that criminalises that practice.<\/p><p> To respond to the remarks on cross-sectoral enforcement, many Departments and agencies specialise in this issue.  The Health and Safety Authority is involved, as is the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Irish Coast Guard and agencies involving ships.  It will be a case of giving additional powers to existing agencies which are the experts in these areas.  One of the issues will obviously be that if they are enforcing criminal law, co-operation may be required from other agencies.  I cannot speak to that because we are at an early stage.  I have to repeat that a bit.  Those are the sort of complex issues which have to be considered.  I can tell the committee that the 2008 directive was very complex to transpose for exactly that reason because it involved changing the legislation governing many existing Departments and agencies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#D01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":29,"content":"<p>Enforcement could be made more difficult in some areas because responsibility rests with so many different Departments.

I was wondering which body would have primary responsibility.<\/p><p>I want to follow up on two or three words.  Mr. Finnegan referred to the idea of tightening the offences.  While he said the offences will still be unlawful, I am a little concerned that the tightening of offences might mean excluding certain things that would be considered unlawful now from the new definition of a crime.<\/p><p>I raise again the issue of &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;systematic&quot;.  I am worried that we are creating new loopholes or defences.  For example, with the idea of <i>mens rea<\/i>, we know that intention is extraordinarily hard to prove in the law.  It is almost impossible do so and, in fact, the Government recently introduced legislation on the argument that intention is too hard to prove.  In that context, it would be useful to know what Ireland is doing at the Council meetings.  Are we being clear around the idea of negligence in the discussion of such matters as &ldquo;serious&rdquo; or &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;?  What is our position in those discussions?<\/p><p>I mentioned the precautionary principle.  Serious negligence is one thing but the precautionary principle is a little different.  It is an obligation to take appropriate measures and steps.  For example, if a company has an incident in Lithuania and then allows another incident to take place in another country, surely at that point it has failed to apply a precautionary principle.  I want to get a sense of where the Department stands on these issues.<\/p><p>Mr. Finnegan indicated he may be able to follow up around environmental impact assessments, which will obviously be key to this.  If the Department could follow up, it would useful to know what public resources - staffing, financial and other - are available to support environmental impact assessments, how that has changed in the past year or two and what the plan is for the following number of years.  It is clear that this is a tool that we will need more and earlier in processes.  I am a bit concerned that we might take the approach we have taken in the past, namely, one where we try to apply it in fewer and fewer cases rather than trying to resource it in a better way.

The points she makes are very valid and I would take them nearly as advice.  She is right that a lead agency can be very useful.  We are at a very early stage here and when we are thinking about transposing this directive when it takes its final form, establishing lead responsibility, if it is possible, could be a very valuable thing to do.<br\/><br\/>The Senator also made a very good point on another issue.  Expressly, the Commission has said it is tightening the definitions so that they are harmonised.  At the moment, with what one might call looser definitions, different member states have ended up with different interpretations.  There is obviously a risk that tightening something also narrows it, which may exclude something one wanted to include.  That is exactly the sort of scrutiny that will be needed as we follow this through the Council, and as the D&aacute;il and Seanad continue to follow this also, in order that we do not have unintended effects as we try to tighten and refine our definitions.<br\/><br\/>The questions the Senator is raising are powerful and go to the heart of what will have to be decided in Council.  It is the interaction between this legislation and our criminal law because the ideas of <i>mens rea<\/i>, negligence and criminalising, as the Senator stated, a breach of the precautionary principle would represent a change in our criminal law.  That is exactly the sort of issue we are at the start of addressing with the Department of Justice.<br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that we are in a particular position as a member state because with the exit of the United Kingdom, Ireland, unlike just about any other member state, has a common law system.  This means there is a significant difference between our criminal justice system and those of other member states.  In recognition of this, Articles 1, 2 and 4a of Protocol 21 on the position of what was then the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, justice and security, which is annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, states that we actually have an option not to take part in this measure, if it proves impossible to reconcile that with our common law criminal justice system.  All I can say on that is that the full implications of the measure are still being considered.  Necessary legal advice will be obtained from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in due course.  That will give us a clear sense as to whether Ireland will be able to participate and how we can participate in it.  If it is proposed to participate, it is a matter that will be formally considered by Government and thereafter by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  <br\/><br\/>We made a declaration at the time of that protocol indicating that we intended to opt in to this type of area to the maximum extent possible.  That approach will be adopted here.  However, the Senator raises very difficult and important issues, including that something drafted and legislated for in a system in another member state does not automatically work here.  We need to ensure the language has the intended effect.  More work will be done on that and we will return to the Government and Oireachtas on that question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#E00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Finnegan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":33,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Finnegan.

On 15 December 2021, the European Commission published two legislative proposals revising the 2009 gas directive and gas regulation, with the aim of decarbonising the EU gas market by facilitating the uptake of renewable and low-carbon gases, including hydrogen.<\/p> <p>  The underlying aim of the proposals is to create the conditions for a shift from fossil natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases, in particular biomethane and hydrogen.  They seek to establish a market for hydrogen by creating the right environment for investment and enabling the development of dedicated infrastructure.  The proposed new market rules will cover access to hydrogen infrastructure, separation of hydrogen production and transport activities and tariff setting.  The intention is that they will be applied in two phases, before and after 2030.<\/p> <p>  There will be a flexible regulatory regime up to 2030.  However, after 2030 it is clearly signalled that the rules will be similar to the current rules for natural gas, for example, that hydrogen network operators must be fully ownership-unbundled and regulated tariffs and open access to networks will apply.  The new rules are intended to make it easier for renewable and low-carbon gases to access the existing gas grid by removing tariffs for cross-border interconnections and lowering tariffs at injection points.<\/p> <p>  Another priority of the package is consumer empowerment and protection.  Similar to the provisions already applicable in the electricity market, the package provides for consumers to switch suppliers more easily, use effective price comparison tools, get accurate, fair and transparent billing information, and have better access to data and new smart technology.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the matter of security of energy supply, under the proposals for gas regulation amendments are also proposed to strengthen the resilience of the gas system, with a particular focus on the role of gas storage.  On 15 December 2021, the European Commission also published its proposals for a regulation on methane emissions.  The legislative proposal on methane emissions reduction in the energy sector would establish a new EU legal framework that requires oil, gas and coal companies within the EU to measure, report and verify their methane emissions.  It also proposes that importers of fossil fuels would be required to submit information about how their suppliers perform measurement, reporting and verification of their emissions and how they mitigate those emissions with a view to the Commission introducing more stringent measures on fossil fuel imports by 2025. <\/p> <p>  The aim of decarbonising the EU gas market by facilitating the uptake of renewable and low carbon gases is in line with the EU&rsquo;s climate targets and will help to support the delivery of Ireland&rsquo;s ambition set out under last year's climate action plan.  The proposals for hydrogen in regard to market access, a transitionary approach to regulation and arrangements to move from a natural gas system are considered to be positive proposals, although they need detailed consideration.<\/p><p>Similarly, the proposals on gas security and integrated planning across electricity, natural gas and hydrogen should help support a planned approach to the energy transition.  However, all of the proposals need to be carefully assessed in the context of Ireland no longer being directly connected to the EU market, now that the UK has left the European Union.  The provisions to mirror consumer rights in the electricity market to those in the gas market, such as improving the ease of switching supplier, greater transparency in billing information and more effective price comparison tools, are positive developments.  The proposed regulation on methane includes key transparency measures that are an important first step in addressing the methane associated with natural gas imported into the EU.  However, the proposals do not go as far as national policy envisages.  In particular, the Policy Statement on the Importation of Fracked Gas, published in May 2021, sets out that the Government will work with like-minded European states to promote and support changes to European energy laws in order to allow the importation of fracked gas to be restricted.<\/p><p> On Friday, 18 February, the Department launched a consultation to gather the views of stakeholders and interested parties on this package, which will inform the further development of Ireland's position on the proposals.  The closing date is Friday, 15 April.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#F01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Regan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Regan.  If I may, I will go first this time.  I have a considerable concern about these proposals, and I believe it is reflected in Mr. Regan's opening statement, which is that there is no distinction being made between green hydrogen, which is something that we would pursue probably quite vigorously in Ireland because we have the renewable energy resource, and other forms of hydrogen, particularly those that are created using fossil fuels.  If we, as the continent of the EU, go down the road here with hydrogen we must be very careful that we do not save the fossil fuel industry by giving it a route via generating hydrogen using processes other than electrolysis of renewable electricity.  This is a serious concern I have about these.<\/p> <p>  My other concern is about how we use hydrogen and how we will use hydrogen.  It seems to me that these proposals suggest that hydrogen would be mixed with natural gas to lower its carbon intensity.  That is just about the worst use of hydrogen we can have.  That is locking in gas use for a long time, for decades to come.  If we go down the road of saying that this is how we use hydrogen, it is a very inefficient use by the time the renewable  electricity has been converted to hydrogen.  One is injecting it into the grid for burning a boiler in somebody's home, which may only be 80% or 90% efficient.  There are very significant losses there.  We should directly electrify as much of our economy as possible, but where we are using hydrogen it should be where we have to use it.  If we are burning hydrogen in gas boilers and transporting hydrogen via the natural gas network, there are colossal losses in that.  It is not the best use of energy that we are going to create in the development of a scaled up renewable energy sector.  There are different ways to use it.  I have concerns that some of these directives are sending us down a path that is not the best use of the resources we have.  Perhaps Mr. Regan would care to comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#G00200","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>The legislation has created two distinct types of renewable and low-carbon hydrogens.  There is pure renewable hydrogen, which is referred to as green hydrogen, and which Ireland supports.  They have created a second category called low-carbon hydrogen.  The test is that there must be 70% emissions reduction versus current levels.  There are a couple of points on that.  First of all, there are a limited amount of ways in which one can make hydrogen: renewable hydrogen and electricity from the grid.  If one is not located directly beside the renewable power station then one might take electricity with some level of carbon.  That is the question.  Low carbon gases would seem to fall into this category.  Nevertheless, there is still the ability to create hydrogen from fossil fuels, for example, without carbon capture and storage, CCS, which would not even fall in that category.  As the Chairman has said, one is simply replacing one fossil fuel with another form of fossil fuels.  That does seem to be an issue that needs to be addressed.  The Commission has not addressed it in a way that stops it, essentially.  Rather, it has addressed it in a way to incentivise the other two of renewable hydrogen and low-carbon hydrogen.  That issue is going to have to be resolved.  Where we are today is that the hydrogen in Europe is largely made of natural gas and it is done without carbon capture and storage, so it is not a good process, and I would certainly not want to see an extension of that process.<\/p> <p>  On the use of hydrogen, yes we absolutely want to see a focus on where the use of hydrogen in Ireland should be.  We intend to do a consultation on that very question during the year leading up to the next climate action plan.  In the positive sense, we have some good signals.  We will be developing offshore renewable electricity, which could be a good source for hydrogen.  With hydrogen use in Ireland we know that heating will focus on energy efficiency, district heating and electric heat pumps.  It is not an obvious place for hydrogen to be used in Ireland.  Similarly, with transport it is about public transport and electric vehicles.  The likely home for this in transport, if it is to be used in transport, would be for heavy duty vehicles, maritime and possibly aviation somewhat further down the line.<\/p> <p>  I echo what the Chairman has said, that this should be used after energy efficiency and after electrification.  The benefit is that it can find to those difficult to decarbonise places, for example high-temperature heating in industry, which is proving very difficult to decarbonise.<\/p> <p>  That would be Ireland's approach as is set out in the climate action plan.  Through our scrutiny of this legislation we must assess whether the gate is too open and that we do not go in the direction of the fossil fuels.  We must also recognise that each member state will need some differences.  For example, Ireland is not a heavy industry country compared with others, so they might put more of their hydrogen there versus our use.  There will be some changes but ideally not enough that fossil fuels would be the answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":51,"content":"<p>I am very happy to hear that answer on Ireland's position.

There may be value there.  For example, those customers who use high-temperature heating in Ireland would typically use natural gas and they are connected to the gas grid.

The case for smart metering in gas is slightly weaker than electricity given that gas can be balanced over a longer period.  Essentially it is not real-time balanced by the grid operator.  The pricing signal is daily, essentially, not half hourly like the electricity.  This is recognised in the legislation which provides that each member state must do a mandatory cost-benefit assessment, CBA, as to whether smart meters for electricity and gas make sense.  However, Article 19 of the directive provides that the customer be given the right to get one anyway.  There is a CBA basis for each member state to do it if it makes sense in their countries.  Even if that is negative, the customer has a right to a smart meter.  That is enshrined in the legislation.  Before I turn to Deputy Bruton's second question, on what the Commission proposed in respect of hydrogen, there is an opportunity here to set up the hydrogen market learning from the lessons of the gas and electricity market.  They are saying that from day one, every meter for hydrogen is to be smart.  There will be no old-fashioned meters, as it were.<\/p> <p>  There are several articles pertaining to consumer empowerment.  There are basic contractual rights, including to transparent information on prices and tariffs, a wide choice of payment methods and plain and unambiguous language.

We are really going to need a key fuel source if we are going to meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Green hydrogen has really good potential not just for heating homes but also for transport.  I am a Deputy for North Kildare, which has turned into something of a logistics hub for heavy goods vehicles.  Electricity is not going to be able to meet that.  We are on the western edge of Europe.  We have an abundance of offshore wind and we are ready to harness that potential.  Despite the millions spent on consultants and advisors, Ireland does not even have a green hydrogen strategy.  Scotland had one in 2015 and the European Commission had one in 2020.

Deputy Cronin's framing of this is really useful, and I think it would be useful if that were the framing at EU level.  We should start mentioning green hydrogen every time we mention hydrogen.  One of my concerns relates to the issue of green hydrogen and the important role hydrogen can plan as a supplement and a support to electrification.  The area that electrification may not be able to reach through green hydrogen has been muddied a little by placing it in the hydrogen strategy.  As for the proposed new body, the European network of network operators for hydrogen, ENNOH, the concern is that green hydrogen may end up being a smaller player within that new network and that many of the oil and gas representative organisations will still be there.  I am interested in that push towards the Beyond Oil &amp;amp; Gas Alliance, to which Ireland has signed up, and the EU and US methane pledge.  Those are two really significant signals that Ireland sent as to where we stand on an exit from gas, recognising it as a fossil fuel.  How are those commitments Ireland has made factoring into the positions we are taking in the negotiations on these matters?<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the infrastructure surrounding gas?  I am concerned that the EU directives as shaped at present still prolong that infrastructure.  Could the witnesses comment on such ideas as the banning of venting and flaring, which has been proposed, mandatory leak detection and repair and some of the other mitigation measures surrounding gas?  The problem is that when that infrastructure is kept in place, there is the challenge of decommissioning it.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on the Energy Charter Treaty?  The European Parliament, I think just last week, produced yet another really strong opinion expressing concern about the treaty.  The concern is that if, in full knowledge of climate impacts and of what the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, is telling us, that is, that we need to have exited from gas as a fossil fuel totally by 2035, if not 2030, we will create new strategies that will still lock that in and create hostages to fortune under the Energy Charter Treaty at the exact same time as Europe is trying to lessen the impact of the treaty.  We have had environmental policies come up against the treaty, and I am worried that if we create new environmental policies that embed the use of gas, we will make it extremely hard for countries to then exit from gas.<\/p> <p>  Could the witnesses comment on those matters?  I referred to the Beyond Oil &amp;amp; Gas Alliance, the EU-US methane pledge, the Energy Charter Treaty and the dangers of a lock-in of gas there that would make policy choices down the line harder.

She is quite right that the Energy Charter Treaty is a moving field.  I think there was a case at the start of the month in Belgium, and it is very much moving.  Our Department is engaging with other member states and the Commission on that and on where it is at.  There is a review ongoing, so it is a relevant topic.<\/p> <p>  As for fossil fuels and fossil fuel infrastructure, if I may deal with those in one response, the package has some interesting proposals on fossil fuels and their reduction over time.  I will focus on just a couple of them.  First, it now includes an express requirement for planning of gas infrastructure and its decommissioning in the plans of infrastructure companies, so decommissioning is an actual requirement to be addressed.  The second thing it does is allow for a transfer of assets from a natural gas pipeline to a hydrogen pipeline.  As Senator Higgins said, there will be hydrogen grid operators and natural gas grid operators, and the legislation allows, quite simply, for a pipeline to move from one asset base of natural gas to hydrogen.  It is essentially a roadway away from fossil fuels.  Third, there is an express provision in the legislation that member states cannot enter long-term contracts for natural gas beyond 2049.  A long-term contract for gas is a one-year contract.  This is the first time we have seen an actual obligation that member states simply cannot buy long-term contracts beyond that period.<\/p> <p>  As for the methane pledge, this legislative proposal goes part of the way towards it.  The methane regulation covers energy methane.  I will focus on emissions outside EU borders rather than inside them because the majority of methane from fossil fuel use in Europe occurs outside our borders, so it is a matter of importation.  The legislation will now require importers to provide information on those methane emissions upstream.  The Commission has signalled that, with that information, and by no later than the end of 2025, it will consider if further obligations are required.  I think this is a world first in that the Commission is looking at methane production beyond the borders of where it is used.<\/p><p>That is going to be a very key piece of the methane pledge.  <\/p><p> The whole purpose of this legislation is to facilitate renewable and low-carbon gases.

The fear is that the roll-out of our own green hydrogen, offshore wind and floating offshore wind will be delayed if we leave the door open to the development of grey hydrogen which would be sourced from fossil fuels.  We have to stress those concerns.  I also echo the Chairman's point about the importance of this committee feeding in to the proposals and strategy going forward.<\/p> <p>  My fear is that we are potentially leaving two gates open, the first one being to grey hydrogen and the second to the importation of fracked gas through LNG infrastructure, in general.  In his opening statement, Mr. Regan referred to the importance of gas storage in the context of energy security.  There certainly has to be a place for gas storage in terms of a backup energy supply but one would hope that in the Irish scenario that would be done using the existing interconnectors.  I am fearful, not just in an Irish context but also in a European context, that this type of proposal and the encouragement of gas storage would potentially lead to the proliferation of LNG terminals.  Ireland has made quite a strong statement with its resistance to future LNG terminals being built but it is important that such an approach is Europe wide.  <\/p> <p>  At the end of his statement, Mr. Regan said that the proposals do not go as far as national policy envisages around the importation of fracked gas.  I am concerned that this represents another opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to delay the inevitable.

It is not seeking new investment in gas storage; rather the legislation provides that member states have the right to ask their gas pipeline operator to ensure that there is a certain level of gas in the storage reservoir that is currently there.  Gas storage levels have been decreasing in recent years which means that when we hit winter, and if the weather is particularly cold, it puts the system under stress with price rises.  There is nothing in the package to facilitate new investment in storage.  Rather it provides that during the winter, if there are concerns, there is enough gas in storage to manage the peak essentially.<\/p> <p>  In terms of what is proposed in the legislation versus Ireland's position, which the Deputy correctly described, the approach lends itself to that in the sense that it seeks to gather data on the full life-cycle emissions of gas imports.  The Commission has raised the flag that before 2025, once it has that data and evidence, it will look to strengthen the position.  Step A is to get the data and evidence and step B is to act.  This means that essentially with high-emission gas like fracked gas, for example, steps can be taken to reduce its use.  It will lend itself to the discussion and to the Irish position.  We will have to consider how we build it into the discussion but it is certainly very helpful for opening that debate.<\/p> <p>  Another proposal from the Commission, which is also new, is to set up a system of global monitoring of methane.  The Commission will be able to see where methane emissions are occurring across the globe and then, using diplomatic language, it will let countries know, in the first instance, that there is a methane issue.  That is a positive proposal.<\/p> <p>  Finally, on hydrogen, the package is designed with a lot of incentives for renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.  It is designed around a suite of incentives for them.  It is also designed to reduce fossil fuel use.  Frankly, we need to do more scrutiny to see how it all knits together because while this is a gas package, it also involves the electricity system, the natural gas system and the hydrogen system.  We are working through it to understand the implications.  While not wanting to complicate matters too much, it is also very much linked to the renewable energy directive, the definitions therein and how it all knits together.

The main purpose of the heat study was to look at how we get out of this.  It does not just look at 2030 but also at 2050.  It looks at how Ireland's heat sector should be to have net-zero emissions by 2050.  2030 is a milestone but the question is about how we get to net zero.  It was only published today, so I accept the Senator will not have the details.  There are a few key answers.  Mr. Regan mentioned them earlier.  Electrification of heat, both direct electrification and via heat pumps, is a substantial factor in heat in buildings.  Another matter is district heating in denser areas.  The report highlights the need to address higher temperature heat and for another zero-carbon energy carrier besides electricity, which is where green hydrogen comes in, particularly in higher-temperature industries.  That ties back into the package that we are talking about.<\/p> <p>  The heat study adds to Ireland's journey or pathway.  It shows that we have a specific issue and what different things we need to do.  The study fits neatly into recent Government policies, such as the retrofit scheme, with the idea of electrifying the heat in our residential building stock.  It identifies gaps, such as the heat in our commercial building stock, and how we use higher temperature heat for industry.  Mr. Regan mentioned the idea of a renewable heat obligation.  One can look at how we are doing so well compared with the European average for electricity or renewable energy for transport.  Schemes in both of those sectors socialise the cost across all consumers.  The public service obligation, PSO, in our electricity bills pays for wind energy and will soon also cover solar energy.  The biofuels obligation scheme in the transport sector requires a certain proportion of the energy used in the transport sector to be renewable.  Fuel pump handles are marked with either B7 or E5, which means up to 5% of petrol or 7% of diesel is renewable.  The Minister for Transport has published a policy statement and increased the biofuels obligation rate for this year again.  That is increasing, but the cost is socialised.<\/p> <p>  There was a consultation before Christmas on a renewable heat obligation.  It is a similar scheme to the biofuels obligation.  That consultation was extended, because there were concerns about the cost, which we would share.  When we talk about socialising costs, that means that energy prices might increase for consumers.  We are acutely aware of that when examining how we decarbonise heat and pay for it.  That is a challenge we are looking at.  The Senator made a point on the heat study.  We view the study as a blueprint of what 2050 should look like.  The policies and measures that we put in place now should be in keeping with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#L00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":88,"content":"<p>Issues relating to investment include measures for socialisation of the cost and another key element, which is how investment is supported in some types of fuel but not in others.<\/p><p>That goes back to the point I made about EU taxonomy, which while not directly related, is an example of how we can move away from promoting renewables over something else, from an investment point of view.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#L00700","speaker":"1693","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I might move that back and use hydrogen as an example.  Most people will agree that the use of hydrogen in the high-temperature heat sector is something Ireland should pursue.  The renewable heat obligation consultation proposed giving a higher weighting to certain fuels, such as green hydrogen.  It was proposed that if a unit of green hydrogen was used instead of a unit of biofuels or bioliquid for heat, it would have a multiplier effect.  That would bridge the cost gap so that a greater weighting value could be placed on certain types of development technologies or fuels that we want to incentivise.  There are ways and means of doing that as the policies and measures are developed.  Again, I suppose it is about having a view of the outcome that we see and need.  I agree that we cannot just have a market; there certainly need to be incentivisations.  If we look back at the gas regulation and directive that has been proposed by the EU Commission, we can see these tariff reductions.  The regulation and directive do not contain everything on hydrogen, but there are significant reductions in entry tariffs of putting hyrdogen into the grid, etc.  That is a way of promoting it above other fuels.  There are definitely ways and means of doing it.  That is what we need to focus on.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Brady"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":91,"content":"<p>Mr. Brady will be glad to know that when we conclude our series on offshore wind and hydrogen, we are going to get into renewable heat, probably in April or May.

One relates to LNG.  It is positive that there is an inquiry and a focus on emissions at production point, as the witnesses mentioned.  It is in line with some of the scoped rethinking around emissions captures.  There is huge concern around methane emissions from fracking, in particular.  It is the question on the locking-in of imports.  A previous regime in the US was looking at withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.  There is a concern - and perhaps the witnesses might comment on it - about how we would basically insulate if, for example, infrastructure around the importation of LNG was put in place, contracts associated with that infrastructure were concluded, and subsequently, we found ourselves in a position where a country, such as the US, decided to roll back on any monitoring or proper engagement on methane.<\/p> <p>  I will ask two or three specific questions.  Perhaps the witnesses could comment on the European Network of Network Operators for Hydrogen, ENNOH, which is a new body that has been proposed to regulate the hydrogen market, and the concern that at the moment there does not seem to be a requirement for unbundling.  Oil and gas producers could effectively play a key role in that new regulation of hydrogen space if they also have a hydrogen division.  Again, I highlight the importance of separating that.  Of course, it does create a tension and a conflict of interest if major gas companies are playing a key role in hydrogen.  That, of course, pushes us towards green hydrogen again.  <\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked a question on the grid.  Is the vision electrification with support for electrification from green hydrogen or a new version of gas infrastructure with perhaps a little more green hydrogen in there?  They are almost different visions for what comes next in Europe.  They are major questions regarding investment.  That is why Ireland really should champion the fight against the dilution of the taxonomy.  Ireland is in a position to paint that picture of green hydrogen as a supplement to electrification image and, indeed, to support that across Europe.  In respect of the taxonomy piece, if there is dilution, it will not only mean investment going in to gas, gas infrastructure and the prolongation of gas infrastructure, but it is also investment that will go against the truly sustainable future in terms of green hydrogen.  There is a tension.  I ask the witnesses to comment on whether Ireland is really championing that alternative vision.  Do we see that there is a conflict?  Is it the case that the interests of green hydrogen not necessarily being fully represented within the gas infrastructure narrative, and in fact, may be at odds with it in that sense?  While it can be a part of gas infrastructure, it is always going to be downstream in terms of investment, particularly when we see developments like the Nordstream 2 pipeline. In terms of security for the long term, we know there is greater security in a truly renewable source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#M00400","speaker":"1662"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":93,"content":"<p>In the first instance, the ENNOH acronym is quite difficult.  It is a European hydrogen network operator.  The principle behind that is there is an existing network for electricity and for gas.  It basically makes the transmission system operators co-operate to facilitate a European market.  Largely, the network is born out of a previous gas crisis where it was found that the grids could transfer gas around Europe, but the rules and the market conditions were not there to facilitate it.  It was imposed on the gas network operators for that purpose.  It has proven to work very well.  Hence, we have a proposal for a new network for hydrogen.  It is important to note that the hydrogen network is separate from the electricity grid operator network and the gas operator network.  Co-ordinated plans must be made at member state level for all three - hydrogen, electricity and natural gas - so that we avoid having plans that essentially do not talk to each other and the line.  There are unbundling rules within this package for hydrogen.  Essentially, there is some flexibility up to 2030.  It is expected that as hydrogen develops, there will essentially be small clusters in member states, which over time will develop into a full hydrogen market.  I think the Commissioner is saying that investors can have some flexibility this decade in that investment and in creating hydrogen networks.  However, the Commission has been very clear from the outset that there is unbundling of operators and transmissions from 2030.  It is a good signal from the Commission.  It has been challenging, as I am sure Deputies and Senators will be aware, in gas and electricity.  The advantage here is that we have a clean slate almost.  The Commission is clear on the rules.<\/p> <p>  On the question of the vision, I look on this proposal quite positively in the overall sense, in that it creates a market for renewable gases and low-carbon gases.  It is very good.  It is a separate market to the current natural gas market.  It is a very complex package and there are levers in there.  We need to carefully consider and understand what the effect of those levers would be.  In terms of the overall vision, the focus is towards a net-zero 2050.  There will be a pathway to that objective, depending on different roads, such as blending and transitioning.  Currently, 10% of natural gas in Europe is used for hydrogen.  If that could be switched to renewable gas, that would be quite a dramatic change in Europe's gas imports and Ireland's.  The vision of the climate action plan is clear on energy efficiency,  and electrification.  Hydrogen will also have a key role in those hard to abate sectors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022022200002#M00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Noel Regan"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>That concludes the questions for the witnesses today.

Mr. Saleh Higazi is attending online.  He is deputy director of our regional office for the Middle East and north Africa region, and head of our office in east Jerusalem.  Seated on my left is Mr. Tim Hanley who is the campaigns officer at Amnesty International.   We very much look forward to discussing our research in-depth with the committee  following my opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Our report details how Israeli authorities are enforcing a system of apartheid against all Palestinians living under their effective control.  This includes Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as well as Palestinian refugees in other countries.  The report documents how Israel treats Palestinians as an inferior racial group, segregating and oppressing them wherever it has control over their rights.  It provides new evidence of the institutionalised nature of Israel's oppression of Palestinians, and of how Israeli laws and policies are designed specifically to deprive Palestinians of their rights.<\/p> <p>  Amnesty International adopted a global policy on the human rights violations and crime of apartheid in 2017.  This has enabled us to examine the potential situations of apartheid globally on a consistent basis.  For example, in 2017, we released a report which found that the Myanmar Government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid.<\/p> <p>  For too long the international community has sidelined human rights when dealing with the question of Israel and the Palestinians.  Palestinians experiencing the brutality of Israel's repression have called for an understanding of Israel's rule as apartheid for more than two decades.  Over time, a broader international recognition of Israel's treatment of Palestinians as apartheid has begun to take shape.<\/p> <p>  Amnesty International's findings build on a growing body of work on the question of apartheid by Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organisations, as well as lawyers, writers and academics.  Palestinians have called for an understanding of Israel's rule as apartheid for more than two decades, and have been at the forefront of advocacy in that regard at the UN.  More recently, research by the Israeli human rights organisations Yesh Din and B'Tselem, as well as Human Rights Watch, has contributed to a spectrum of analysis within the legal framework of apartheid.<\/p> <p>  The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in our report make it clear that the international community must drastically change its approach.  It must recognise the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people for what they are, which is apartheid.  Through its failure to take any meaningful action to hold Israel to account for its systematic and widespread violations, and crimes under international law, against the Palestinian population, the international community has contributed to undermining the international legal order, and has emboldened Israel to continue perpetrating these crimes with impunity.  Apartheid is a crime against humanity and the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.<\/p> <p>  The report analysed Israel's intent to create and maintain a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians and examined its key components, that is, territorial fragmentation; segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and the denial of economic and social rights.<\/p> <p>  Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued a policy of establishing and then maintaining a Jewish demographic majority, and maximising control over land and resources to benefit Jewish Israelis.    Today, all territories controlled by Israel continue to be administered with the purpose of benefiting Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, while Palestinian refugees continue to be excluded.  Our research has also documented unlawful as well as inhumane or inhuman acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to maintain this system, including forcible transfers, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings, the denial of basic rights and freedoms and persecution.  It has concluded that such acts form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population, and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid as defined in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  We found that these constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid because they are committed in a context of systematic oppression and domination, and with the intent to maintain that system.<\/p> <p>  Amnesty acknowledges that inhuman or inhumane acts inside Israel occur to a lesser degree, and in a far less violent manner, than in the occupied Palestinian territories.  However, our report documents violations inside Israel that amount to inhumane acts and, in the context of the wider system of domination and oppression of Palestinians, the crime against humanity of apartheid.<\/p> <p>  Palestinian citizens in Israel enjoy greater rights and freedoms than their counterparts in the occupied Palestinian territories, while the experience of Palestinians in Gaza is very different from those who live in the West Bank.  Nonetheless, Amnesty International's research shows that all Palestinians are subject to the same overarching system.  Israel's treatment of Palestinians across all areas is pursuant to the same objective, to privilege Jewish Israelis in the distribution of land and resources, and to minimise the Palestinian presence and access to land.<\/p> <p>  We make a number of very specific calls at the end of this lengthy research report.  With regard to the Israeli authorities, our primary call is for Israel to end the international wrong and crime of apartheid by dismantling measures of fragmentation, segregation, discrimination and deprivation that are currently in place against the Palestinian population.  In our report, Amnesty provides numerous specific recommendations for how the Israeli authorities can do this.<\/p> <p>  We call for an end to the brutal practice of home demolitions and forced evictions as a first step.  Israel must grant equal rights to all Palestinians in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories in line with the principles of international human rights and humanitarian law.  Israel must recognise the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their families once lived.  Israel must also provide victims of human rights violations and crimes against humanity with full reparations.<\/p> <p>  The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in our report calls for a drastic change in the international community's approach to the human rights crisis in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.  We call on the international community, including Ireland, to put pressure on Israel to end this system of oppression and domination.  We call for the Israeli authorities to be held accountable for <\/p> <p>committing the crime of apartheid against Palestinians, and for all those with jurisdiction over the crimes under international law committed to maintain the system of apartheid, to investigate them.<\/p> <p>  Our recommendations to other states, including Ireland, are: to publically recognise that international crimes, including the crime of apartheid, are being committed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories; to not support the system of apartheid or render aid or assistance to maintaining such a regime; and to co-operate to bring an end to this unlawful situation.<\/p><p>We call on governments to immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and transshipment, to Israel of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance.  We call on them to institute and enforce a ban on products from Israeli settlements in their markets and to regulate companies domiciled in their jurisdiction in a manner to prohibit companies' operation in settlements or trade in settlement goods.<\/p><p> We call on governments to use all political and diplomatic tools at their disposal to ensure Israeli authorities implement the recommendations outlined in this report and ensure that human rights are central to all bilateral and multilateral agreements with the Israeli authorities, including by exercising due diligence to ensure these do not contribute to maintaining the system of apartheid.<\/p><p> We call on governments to exercise universal jurisdiction in investigating any person under their jurisdiction who may reasonably be suspected of committing crimes against humanity or other crimes under international law.  We call on them to ensure all proceedings meet international standards of fairness and do not involve seeking or imposing the death penalty.  There should be no time limit for prosecuting crimes against humanity, nor should immunity from prosecution or amnesties be granted for such crimes.  We call on governments to ensure their legal and institutional frameworks enable the effective investigation and prosecution of perpetrators of the crime against humanity of apartheid.<\/p><p> We have recommendations for Ireland as a member of the UN Security Council.  We call on Ireland to support action to impose targeted sanctions such as asset freezes against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid.  We call on it to support action to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel.  As I have said, the embargo should cover the direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and transshipment of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance.<\/p><p> We call on Ireland to support action to explore avenues to bring perpetrators of crimes under international law to account, in particular if Israel itself fails to investigate and prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human rights violations perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.  This could include referring the entire situation to the International Criminal Court or establishing an international tribunal to try alleged perpetrators of international crimes.<\/p><p> Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity.  When a crime against humanity is committed the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account.  We hope that by shedding more light on Israel's discriminatory system of domination over the Palestinian people, we will intensify efforts to dismantle the harmful policies and practices that prevent Palestinians from living with equal rights and dignity.  This can only be achieved when the international community holds the Israeli Government and other complicit parties accountable.  Apartheid has no place in our world and states which choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history.  Ultimately, Israel must dismantle the apartheid system and start treating Palestinians as human beings with equal rights and dignity.  Until it does, peace and security will remain a distant prospect for Israelis and Palestinians alike.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":105,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. O'Gorman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#C00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":106,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. O'Gorman, Mr. Hanley and our guest in South Africa.  They are very welcome to the committee to discuss what is a very important publication.  It follows previous publications from B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and most recently from the former Israeli attorney general, Michael Benyair.  They have all come to the conclusion that Israel is operating a system of apartheid.  This is something people have been saying for a long time.  There is overwhelming and convincing evidence now to show what is being operated on the Palestinians is apartheid.<\/p><p>The committee has done extensive work on this issue and Israel's brutal policies against the Palestinians.  A witness who previously came before the committee, Professor Noura Erakat, told the committee what Israel's goal is and it summed it up for me:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIsrael's goal is to take as much Palestinian land, with as few Palestinians on the land as possible, and to concentrate the greatest number of Palestinians onto the least amount of land possible. This is evidenced in, and explains, the 29 contiguous bantustans in the West Bank, the concentration of Palestinians in an open air prison in the Gaza Strip. <\/blockquote> <p>That is what this is all about.  Of course, we know exactly where bantustans originated.  It was in the apartheid system that was in operation in South Africa.  Unfortunately it took far too long to dismantle it and that only happened when the eyes of the world were opened up to the brutal actions of the apartheid system in South Africa.  Unfortunately, the world continues to look away when fantastic and hard-hitting reports such as this are published.  They show clearly what is happening on the ground.<\/p><p>I have several questions and perhaps the witnesses can answer them at the conclusion.  Mr. O'Gorman said work on the report was done between July 2017 until 2021.  We know Israel has dismissed every report that has criticised it.  It has said it is refusing to embark or engage with the investigation by the International Criminal Court, ICC.  Was research and analysis carried out on the ground?  Was there any support from the Israeli occupation authorities?  How was the research and work carried out?<\/p><p>I have listened to the international reaction to the report and the attempts to dismiss it.  I saw the response from our Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was asked for our response.  He said he has highlighted Ireland's clear position expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory.  He stated Ireland will continue to raise our concerns regarding discriminatory practices towards the Palestinian people.  This response is exactly why we have the report we have.  Ministers such as Deputy Coveney and the international community throughout the world continue to bury their heads in the sand and allow this system of apartheid to carry on.<\/p><p>The report contains some very good recommendations.  I want to hone in on some of them.  Along with others I have highlighted how Ireland is complicit in the apartheid system in operation in the occupied territories and throughout Palestinian lands.  We have seen the continued opposition to allowing the occupied territories Bill coming forward.  It would be a definitive measure and a stand against the brutal occupation and apartheid system.  We see the refusal to bring it forward.<\/p><p>Last year, after considerable debate, Ireland was the first EU country to declare that Israel has breached international law in annexing Palestinian lands.  Since then the silence has been absolutely deafening.  We find that Israel has breached international law but we are not prepared to do anything to hold it to account.  This is a major failure.<\/p><p>What is the view of our guests on that issue?  It stands in stark contrast to what is happening in other parts of the world at the moment in the context of the territorial integrity of Ukraine being at serious risk and the brutal actions of Russia.  Swift action was taken in respect of that brutal occupation - measures and sanctions were imposed straight away - but we see the inconsistency of the international community in the failure to impose similar measures, or any measures whatsoever, in respect of the brutal actions of Israel.<\/p><p> There are several recommendations relating to military co-operation between states and Israel.  From 2011 to 2014 there was &euro;3 million in trade between the Irish Defence Forces and the Israeli defence forces.  That involved the buying of weapons that have been tested on Palestinian citizens.  The response of the Minister is that there is a proper procurement process in place.  It is absolutely crazy that the State is carrying on any trade, but particularly military trade, with Israel.  I note that is one of the recommendations in the report.  All of the recommendations need to be adopted straight away but I refer in particular to the recommendation relating to the UN General Assembly and calling for the re-establishment of the special committee on apartheid.  That is something that can be done and must be done straight away.  <\/p><p> I do not disagree with anything in the report.  It is about how we make the international community and the Irish Government take action when they continue to stick their heads in the sand.  They are seriously in breach of so many international laws.  These are crimes against humanity but those in the international community, including Ireland, continue to stick their heads in the sand.  How will we force the Government to take action?  It seems to be hiding behind the EU but the EU is not interested and does not want to take action for whatever reason.  Fundamentally, ordinary citizens need to take a stand in the first instance and force the Government of the day to take action, as the Dunnes Stores workers did back in the 1980s when they took a stand against the apartheid system in South Africa.  I commend the report but it is critical that political pressure is exerted on those who have the influence and power to actually bring an end to the crimes against humanity and the flagrant breaches of humanitarian law that are being carried out.  There are so many recommendations in the report that relate to the UN.  UN expert Michael Lynk has stated the Israeli settlement expansion tramples on human rights laws.  That is a UN special rapporteur himself stating clearly that what Israel is doing is trampling on human rights laws.  There are voices pointing out the flagrant breaches of international law and criticising that but how can we force those in power to take action and stand up against the brutal actions of Israel?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#C00300","speaker":"1625","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":108,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Brady.

Right across the committee there is an acceptance of the fundamental findings of the report that there is systematic oppression of the Palestinian people, that there are illegal settlements - in fact, they have been increasing - and that there is an entire system of control and oppression right through the occupied territories.  I do not think there is any question about that.  It is accepted.  The report is very thorough and detailed in that regard and Mr. O'Gorman got that point across succinctly in his presentation.<\/p> <p>  Party politics is not an issue within this committee or others like it.  Rather, it is about the matter confronting the committee.  However, I feel it is incumbent on me to state that one of the points made by my very good friend, Deputy Brady, is not objectively the case.  I invite him to comment further if he so wishes.  In fact, another friend of mine who is in the Gallery and has listened to many debates in the Seanad has accepted the bona fides of the Minister.  I think the current Minister for Foreign Affairs is very concerned with this issue.  He has visited Palestine on several occasions and is occupied by and sincerely engaged with the issue.  He recognises the wrongs in this situation and has put that on record repeatedly, including in debates in the Seanad initiated by my friend in the Gallery.  That is objectively the case.  If I understand his contributions to date correctly, there is not one finding he would challenge in terms of the detail of the report but his contention is that he has to maintain the moral authority and capacity to advance the two-state solution and the peace process which, tragically, is not very live at the moment.  I would be interested in the views of our guests on this.  That potential must be there.  He must have the moral authority and be able to speak to both sides while being unequivocal on this issue.  He has repeatedly been unequivocal on it.  I am not aware of any Member of these Houses who for one moment would suggest there is not systematic oppression here.<\/p> <p>  I am aware of Council of Europe reports on minors being victims of police harassment or being jailed and raids taking place at night.  The litany goes on.  I sat through a plenary session of the Council of Europe at which we dealt with a report specifically about the oppression and criminalisation of minors.  They are being taken from their homes and, in some instances, tortured.  They and their families are being terrorised.  That is all on record and nobody is suggesting the contrary.  I would like our guests to respond on the basic contention that the moral authority of a neutral country such as Ireland might be challenged or compromised if we do not maintain the capacity to speak to both sides, particularly in the context of the UN.<\/p><p>Amnesty's response to that will be interesting.  That is the fundamental question I would ask.  I am not here to challenge any of Amnesty's findings.  Indeed, I am not aware of any person who would wish to do so and nor could he or she factually do so.  What we do with the findings?  How do we progress them and get the correct outcome?<\/p><p> For the sake of balance and objectivity, which I am sure Deputy Brady would welcome, we must explore both sides of this argument.  How do we proceed here?  Do we go for the nuclear option?  In that case, the Minister's capacity to progress things would be damaged.  That is the fundamental question and I am interested to hear the answer from the witnesses.  Sadly, the facts are the facts and, tragically, it is all true.  It is only a question of how we deal with it, how we approach it and where we go from here.<\/p><p> Things look very bleak at the moment but does Amnesty see any prospect of a fledgling peace process or any initiatives in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#D00800","speaker":"1692","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":116,"content":"<p>Having regard to the fact we have heard from three members of the committee who have asked a considerable number of questions and forwarded a diversity of observations, I propose to go back to Mr. O'Gorman, Mr. Hanley and Mr. Higazi for their responses.

That is incredibly important because the first thing, and this goes to one of Deputy Brady's questions, that all states should do, including Ireland, is acknowledge the simple, established fact that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid against Palestinians and against the Palestinian populations wherever it exerts control over those populations.  That is critically important.  We must be able to name honestly what is happening and then work to hold to account those who are responsible for such crimes.<\/p> <p>  The committee heard what we said earlier about applying all possible influence and pressure on Israel to ensure it dismantles this system.  The simple reality, which we must begin to acknowledge, is that under the cover of political process and the pursuit of a peace process that seems to deliver for everybody but the Palestinians, Israel continues to build and develop further this system of apartheid, oppression and control of the Palestinian population.  The approach the international community is adopting at the moment is not in any way addressing the grave crimes that continue to be perpetrated by Israel.  Indeed, it is allowing Israel to advance and even increase the egregious nature of those crimes.

We want to see that continue.  If it is the case that Senator O'Reilly, all members of this committee and the current Irish Government, including the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, agree with everything that is revealed in this extensive, detailed research report, then there is only one possible outcome.  Ireland must immediately recognise that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid and should use all mechanisms available to ensure the system is dismantled and those responsible for those crimes are held accountable.  I do not believe it is possible to hold any kind of moral authority to advance the cause of human rights, peace and security if one is not prepared to stand up for and defend the rule of international law.  I very much hope that is what we will see from the Irish Government.  We have seen it repeatedly from the Irish political system and from successive Irish governments in the context of this particular question, and I hope we can do so again.  We are engaging directly with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister and that will continue.  I understand there will be statements in the Seanad on this matter in the coming weeks and that the Minister will participate in that, so I am sure we will hear more then.<\/p> <p>  On the question of maintaining the capacity to speak to both sides, I do not believe it is possible to engage in meaningful efforts to move this matter forward if we do not name simple facts.  We must start from a position of establishing truth and then require all parties to any discussion to respect their obligations under international law.  On the question of Ireland recognising the facts set out in this report and responding appropriately, Ireland along with all other states has an obligation under international law to name this wrong.  It has an obligation simply to name and challenge this wrong and to stand up for and defend the rule of international law.  That means, particularly in the case of a very grave international crime against humanity like apartheid, naming that, seeking an end to the perpetration of that crime, and ensuring those responsible are held to account.<\/p> <p>  In some ways that starts to respond to Deputy Gannon's questions about the comments made by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I understand that, in political terms, it might be felt that language can be unhelpful at times.  The Taoiseach is on the record as saying the Government would not use the term \"apartheid\" in describing Israel's policies against the Palestinians.  We are not using terms.  We are providing evidence that makes it very clear that, as a matter of law, the crime of apartheid is being perpetrated.  It is not a term, a turn of phrase or a glib, throwaway statement.  We are applying international law to the specific context and making findings grounded in law.  It is not about phraseology or terms.  It is about law, respect for the rule of law, human rights and the dignity of the millions of Palestinians the international community has failed to protect for many decades.<\/p><p> On the question of the speaker who, I understand, is due to speak in the Oireachtas in a couple of days' time, all perspectives to this discussion are important and are welcome.  Mr. Yoseph Haddad is somebody who has spoken very often about his particular perspective as a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and as an Arab citizen of Israel.  Our research involved speaking to and engaging with Israeli Arabs to get their perspectives.  However, on that specific question and other questions to do with the research, I will defer to my colleague, Mr. Higazi, who, as it happens, is a Palestinian citizen of Israel and can deal with that more substantively.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#E01300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":129,"content":"<p>I thank the committee for having me here today.  I will start with the last point.  I am a Palestinian citizen of Israel.  To address Deputy Gannon&rsquo;s point about speaking to Palestinian citizens of Israel, and it touches a bit on the research methodology of this report, the 280-page report consists of more than 20 years of systematic documentation of human rights violations, which we revisited, carried about Amnesty International, both in Israel and occupied Palestinian territories.  We have more than 30 case studies in the report.  The majority of these are case studies we have reported and campaigned on for more than 20 years, including case studies inside of Israel, particularly in the Naqab-Negev Desert, where there is a situation whereby Palestinian citizens of Israel live in what are called &ldquo;unrecognised villages&rdquo;.  They are denied basic services, including electricity, water and education.  Although they are citizens of Israel, their right to political participation, including in municipal and parliamentary elections, is impeded by the lack of the infrastructure that Israel does not provide them with.<\/p> <p>  A system of oppression and domination will indeed create a hierarchy among those who are oppressed and dominated.  Therefore, the experience of oppression may be different from one place to another.  This is not limited to geography.  Some of the Palestinians living in Ramallah may be living a less oppressive reality than those living in Al-Naqab in unrecognised villages.  Mr. Haddad may be living a less oppressive reality or experience than me, for example.  We, as Palestinian citizens of Israel, are prevented from access to 80% of the land.  I am, for example, prevented from passing my status as a citizen to my wife.  My children are not registered to her and therefore cannot travel with her outside of the country, only with me.  Therefore we have to go separate ways &ndash; me through the airport and her through Jordan.  I am prevented from taking my wife, for example, to visit family in Jerusalem without a permit.  As members may know, the process of applying for permits can be and is, most often, a degrading, humiliating and often dangerous process.  It may include interrogation by Israeli security forces.<\/p> <p>  On top of that, in 2018, to crown a body of laws, policies and practices that are discriminatory against Palestinians, Israel passed the nation state law, stating very clearly in a claw of constitutional value, that this state, Israel, is only for Jewish people and only Jewish people have the right to self-determination in this state.  This also angered many Arab Jews in the state who serve in the army and have protested and continue to protest this law.  Indeed, the experiences of oppression are different.  They are not all equal, but we are all equal under a system of apartheid.<\/p> <p>  If I may just return a little bit to the issue of methodology, the report consists of in-depth legal analysis of a body of laws, policies, and practices that Israel has put in place with regard to Palestinians, from the time of establishment until today.  We look at laws that relate to nationality and status, land and property, and social and economic rights.  As I mentioned, we revisited our documentation over the past couple of decades.  We carried out new documentation on the ground.  I am speaking to the committee from South Africa, but now we are based in East Jerusalem in Ramallah and I have a team there.  Along with other colleagues who usually also carry out field research, including by visiting the communities and victims and getting testimonies and collecting evidence, including court documents, video and photographic evidence, medical reports and whatever corroborative evidence related to the specific case we are documenting, our team carried out, also in the context of writing this report, research on the ground specific to this report.<\/p> <p>  There was a question from Deputy Brady about the co-operation by the Israeli authorities.  Unfortunately, despite us requesting information and meetings on a number of occasions, including sending a letter last July to request a meeting between our secretary general, Agn&eacute;s Callamard, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, which has gone, as usual, unanswered, the Israeli authorities do not respond to our requests for meetings or letters to request information.<\/p> <p>  Also, it is very important to highlight that Amnesty International, as well as Human Rights Watch, has been denied access to Gaza since 2012.  I was on the last delegation that visited Gaza in 2012 and that was to document violations by the Hamas authorities there as well as the effects of Israel&rsquo;s illegal blockade amounting to collective punishment.<\/p> <p>  I want also to comment on Deputy Brady&rsquo;s point on impunity and world inaction.  Indeed, Israel has been held to a lower standard than other countries when it comes to international law and the violation of human rights.  This is what we certainly hope to change with this report.  By issuing this report, Amnesty has now completed a circle of consensus among human rights organisations.  Deputies have mentioned other reports, including by B&rsquo;Tselem and Yesh Din.  It is important to note that Palestinian human rights organisations, academics and intellectuals have been using this legal framework of analysis for more than 20 years now.  They have paved the way.  Israeli organisations followed, and now international human rights organisations like ourselves have joined to complete this consensus.  We hope this will create a turning point towards dismantling this system of oppression and domination amounting to apartheid, stopping the crime against humanity from being perpetrated, and towards those perpetrating it being held accountable.<\/p> <p>  On the last point, if I may just comment also on the issue of the peace process and the two-state solution, this has, unfortunately, sidelined human rights and international law for too long, allowing for a situation like this one of apartheid and a crime against humanity to be perpetrated and to continue to be perpetrated.  I just want to note that, since the beginning of the year, we heard on at least two occasions from Israel&rsquo;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yair Lapid, that Israel will not continue with negotiations, it will not return to the two-state paradigm and there will not be a Palestinian state.  We also heard, over the past couple of the days, I believe at the Munich Security Conference, the Israeli Minister of Defense also saying there will not be a Palestinian state.  There are these statements from Israelis that are saying the peace process is not here, it will not be here, and that Israel, and this is a position that did not change from previous governments, will not recognise a Palestinian state.  We as a human rights organisation are calling for international law and human rights to be centred in any engagement with both Israeli and Palestinian authorities and in their relationship with each other.<\/p><p>Without doing that, the current crisis will continue.  I hope I have addressed some of the points.  I am happy to come back to them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Saleh Higazi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":131,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Higazi.

It may look like something different in different areas, but it does not dilute the impact that oppression has.  <\/p> <p>  If we are committed to recognising international law, the very basis of that is the recognition of basic human rights that goes along with it.  I take what Senator O'Reilly said regarding the amount of talk and detail that has gone into the Council of Europe.  While that has a place, there is now a diminished defence of a failure to act and failure of movement that cannot be allowed to continue.  We can only speak about issues for a certain length of time.  We can only debate issues for a certain length of time before that needs to result in the next step, whatever that may lead to.  While we can express and raise concern, that does not improve the lives of the people most impacted by the actions of the neighbouring state.  <\/p> <p>  The witnesses touched briefly on the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill.  I am curious as to the witnesses' feedback on the report that the committee produced last year.  I would also like to hear their opinion on the potential UN treaty on business and human rights that is to be published quite soon and the impact it could have and role it could play here.  When something is named and called out for what it is, I agree with the witnesses that it brings an additional focus to an issue, regardless of what it may be.  <\/p> <p>  This committee has, as part of its remit, spent a considerable amount of time considering Israel and Palestine, and the various different wrongs that are happening.  I cannot say that we have had a report quite like this to date.  I again congratulate the witnesses on the work they have done.  It is an important piece of work.  I ask for their feedback on our committee report and the potential role for the business and human rights treaty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#G00700","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":137,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett is not a member of the committee, but he is very welcome.

Most of all, I thank Amnesty International for what is an excellent report and one that has the most profound implications for anybody who accepts, which I believe they should, its findings and conclusions.  It is an amazing thing to have, in such a forensic way, detailed the instances of oppression, discrimination and injustice that have been visited on Palestinians, which many might acknowledge.  However, it goes further and explains that the policies of apartheid, oppression and persecution are not the incidental result of this or that government, rather are the outworkings of a system and state that is an apartheid state.  It has been an apartheid state from its very foundation.<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi to comment on that point.  I would say it is impossible to deny the systematic nature of the oppression, persecution and discrimination that Palestinians suffer.  However, we are breaking new, and absolutely correct, ground in saying that those are the outworkings of an apartheid system and are written into the DNA of the Israeli state.  That has very profound implications.  <\/p> <p>  In my case, without any political tutoring I came to those conclusions in 1987 after a few weeks of working in an Israeli moshav in the Negev and then walking a few weeks later into Al Fawar refugee camp in Hebron.  It was apparent to me in the first few weeks of the first Palestinian intifada that I could not describe what I saw as anything other than apartheid.  It screamed at me that this was apartheid.  It was systematic and institutionalised, and in the very nature of the state.<\/p> <p>  I would like Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi to elaborate a little on what that means.  For example, much of the political debate, even though it has been critical of the Israeli state in the treatment of Palestinians, would say that if we change one bit of policy, behaved slightly differently elsewhere and worked genuinely towards a two-state solution maybe we could address the problem.<\/p><p>It seems to me, however, that that cannot resolve the problem.  This is my view and I want to know if it is the view of Amnesty International resulting from its findings.  The inevitable conclusion of this report and of the facts on the ground is that the apartheid system and the state that operates and is based on that apartheid system have to be dismantled.  That has questions for the two-state solution.  In fact, the two-state solution institutionalises apartheid, even by definition.  Will either of the speakers comment on this?  There is a certain analogy here to the extent that very few of us would accept a two-state solution to the conflict in Ireland.  We would reject it.  There is no two-state solution as that is a recipe for sectarian division and conflict in perpetuity.  Yet much of the international narrative is that somehow a two-state apartheid segregation and separation of Jewish and Palestinian people is somehow a viable solution.  Is it the conclusion based on this report that this is not only a fantasy but actually perpetuates the apartheid system because it is based on the separation of Jews and Arabs based on racial differences and that has very profound implications for how we understand the need to address this problem?<\/p><p> Amnesty International has argued for comprehensive sanctions.  If we accept that Israel is an apartheid state, as evidenced by the Israeli law of return which gives Jewish people the right to return to the state of Israel even if they have never set foot in it but denies that right to millions of Palestinians, as set out in the basic law of the state, and extends to such things as the Jewish National Fund and its policies in regard to land and the nation-state law, do we have to say that it is not only about particular sets of sanctions to address this, but that we are duty-bound to have the same approach to the apartheid state of Israel as we had to the apartheid state of South Africa?  Is that not inevitable?  I ask Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi whether the inevitable conclusion one has to draw is that we simply cannot allow an apartheid state to persist and that we cannot give it any kind of legitimacy or credibility at any level if this is a system as bad, or arguably worse in its institutionalisation of apartheid structures, as the apartheid system of South Africa.  Those are my questions.  I commend the Amnesty International team again on putting together a fantastic report.  <\/p><p> To give some breaking news, as well as the Seanad, the D&aacute;il will also be discussing this report today.  I asked for that today and the Chief Whip has indicated that the D&aacute;il will also discuss the report next week.

I welcome this report.  It was joyful to read it and look at the recommendations.  This report lays bear in brilliant detail what Palestinians have said for decades, namely, that they are living under a system of apartheid.  There is no doubt about that.  We know that B'Tselem and others have said the same thing.  B'Tselem is Israel's biggest human rights organisation.  We in Ireland have stood for human rights and played an important role in opposing apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s.  Ireland has an obligation to act on this now.<\/p> <p>  In 2018, I was in the West Bank and Gaza.  I do not know how I got in but I did.  I cannot explain the big impact that had on me.  It left a mark on me that I will never forget.  I saw the blatant apartheid with my own eyes.  I went to Hebron where I saw how Palestinian people were moved out of their homes and businesses, up into the mountains.  They were not allowed to walk down their own streets.  Imagine if, on Dublin's Grafton Street, people were moved out of where they lived, apartments or businesses, taken out somewhere and then not allowed to walk up even to look at where they used to live.  This is in the West Bank under the so-called two-state solution.  I drove through the settlements.  People have this image of the settlements being little huts, but it was like driving through Florida.  There were palm trees, shopping centres, big fountains, swimming pools and when you drive around the corner people have no water and their electricity has been cut off.  They are living in deprivation and poverty.  People cannot drive down their own roads.  If they have a certain licence plate, they are not allowed to drive on the main roads but must drive another route.  Kids in Hebron, instead of going 200 m to their school from where they live, have to walk two miles because soldiers were there.  We were allowed to go down those streets because we were with an Israeli citizen, an ex-Israeli soldier from Breaking the Silence.  He told us, on that trip, that when he and other soldiers were going on duty from midnight until 8 a.m., they were told to make their presence felt.  He said they had to go into homes in the middle of the night and terrorise those people so that all their neighbours would hear them.  That was making their presence felt.  Sometimes they would insult the women to get the men going.  They would do that from midnight until 8 a.m.  The chances are that will happen tonight while we are asleep in our beds.  That is the reality.  That is what I saw.<\/p> <p>  I cannot tell our guests what this means to me.  The International Court of Justice, ICJ, states that these settlements are illegal and break international law.  We are trying to do something that is not major by any means.  All we are trying to do to make a point is not receive goods from settlements.  By receiving these goods, we in Ireland are breaking international law.  When I started to campaign for the occupied territories Bill, I held public meetings around the country.  People were hanging from the rafters at those meetings.  They were crowded.  People were turned away from them.  In this country we know what it must be like for the Palestinian people.<\/p> <p>  This report means so much to me and the Irish people.  I cannot thank Amnesty International enough for it.  At last, we have an organisation like Amnesty International saying that this is apartheid.  It was the same in the 1980s.  The Irish Government in the 1980s would not support legislation at that time, and it was the people in Ireland who changed the course of what happened in South Africa in the 1980s.  I believe the people might do the same again.  I intend to hold meetings again in this country, with this report, to say \"This is apartheid\".  That is what I would like to see happen in this country.  It is not just about the Government and what it is saying.  This is about what the people are saying.<\/p> <p>  I have two questions for Mr. Higazi.  One is about the occupied territories Bill.  What would it mean to the Palestinian people to have the occupied territories Bill passed in this country?  I have been invited to many countries in Europe, as well as Chile and other countries to talk about the occupied territories Bill because people in those countries want to introduce similar legislation.<\/p><p>I have not got around to visiting them all.  What would it mean to the Palestinian people?  I remember when we could not get the occupied territories Bill in the programme for Government.  When we brought it in during the last term, all Opposition parties, including Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, supported us.  When it was discussed as part of the programme for Government, it was taken off the programme, which was devastating.  What was that like for the Palestinian people?  Is Mr. Higazi aware of what that was like for them, because I know I got hundreds of emails from them asking what was going on.  They thought Ireland was going to help them.  They thought Ireland was going to stand up for what was right, and for them.  The Palestinian people are looking to Ireland to help them.  That is why this report is so important, and I cannot thank Amnesty enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#H00300","speaker":"1632","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":143,"content":"<p>I remind Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi, in particular, to whom the question was addressed, about the piece of legislation referred to.  I do not believe it is as simplistic as suggested by Senator Black.  It is a light piece of legislation.  The House will have an opportunity to discuss it.  It is not just an issue of political will.  There are some legal issues attached.  However, I do not wish to pre-empt what Mr. Higazi might say by way of a response.<\/p> <p>  I will come back to Mr. O'Gorman and his team in response to the very strong contributions of Deputy Clarke and our visiting representatives from both Houses, Deputy Boyd Barrett and Senator Black.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has asked for an elaboration of the terminology of \"apartheid\".  As a reminder to members and, indeed, Mr. O'Gorman, last year we produced what we described, and was independently described as, a pretty comprehensive report calling for an end to practices we described as unacceptable.  We forwarded copies to the Government and to the Houses of the Oireachtas.<\/p> <p>  I put it to Mr. O'Gorman and Mr. Higazi that, while we all acknowledge the importance of the report, we should go further in terms of next steps to look at the recommendations.  For example, the report calls for an end to home demolitions.  We already accepted that.  The report calls for an end to forced evictions.  We accept that.  It states that Israel must grant equal rights to Palestinians in Israel and in the OPT, in line with principles of international human rights law.  We have accepted that as a committee.  It further calls on Israel to recognise the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return home, to where they or their families lived in the past.  We, again, called for that.  The report calls for the international community to step up its engagement to end the cycle of conflict.  Nobody would disagree with that, least of all members of our all-party committee.  However, I note that Amnesty's Israel chief criticised the group's report, which accused Israel of apartheid.  One might expect a refusal by Israel to accept the report would not be in any way surprising.  It is what one would expect from the usual suspects.  However, it seems to me that there are suspects who may not be \"usual\".  I refer to Molly Malekar when she said that Amnesty International's report is too sweeping an indictment, ignores human rights work and wrongly depicts Arab-Israelis as helpless victims.  It was very strong criticism.<\/p> <p>  In addition to Senator Black's question, would Mr. Higazi like to comment on the head of the Ra'am party in Israel, Mansour Abbas, who said he would not use the word apartheid to describe relations between Jews and Arabs within the country?  Mr. Abbas noted that he is in a position to join the cabinet, which he may well do.  He felt that it was a little unhelpful to use the very strong terminology in the report.  He is looking for solutions and to bring people together.<\/p> <p>  In terms of next steps for the report, I acknowledge that members of this committee and the Houses of the Oireachtas will have a role in what Deputy Boyd Barrett said about debates next week perhaps in the form of a motion from the Parliament.  I have not seen the detail, but Deputy Boyd Barrett might help me in that regard.  I thank Mr. O'Gorman for dealing with the queries and questions of the members so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#J00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":144,"content":"<p>The Chairman might assist me.  I have tried to make a note of the significant number of questions that have been asked and I want to try to deal with them all.  If there is any we do not get to, perhaps the Chairman will remind us, particularly the questions he raised.<\/p> <p>  A general point I wish to make is that we of course recognise the extraordinary work many people have been doing for a very long time on this issue.  One of the things we think is significant about the publication of this report is that it now establishes a consensus across the international human rights movement that the crime of apartheid is being committed by Israel.  That is an important moment.  There is now a clear consensus on that fact and we are calling on others to step up, to name that wrong, to acknowledge that crime, and to take the steps that flow from that.  We recognise the work of B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and other organisations in that regard.  We were very conscious of that fact when coming before this committee.  This is an issue on which this committee has been very engaged.  We welcome, appreciate and value the calls made in the committee's recent report that reflect many of the steps we are taking which are critical to dismantling the system of apartheid this report reveals.<\/p> <p>  However, we urge the committee to go one step forward and recognise that all the violations that members have identified and called for an end to, constitute a system of domination and control over Palestinians, who fall under the control of Israel, and that that amounts to the crime of apartheid.  We ask the committee to look at the evidence collected in its own work and the sum of all the recommendations the committee made.  It made those recommendations on the basis that there are breaches of international law being committed by Israel.  Members must realise that there is a system at play here.  Please look at the very solid and extensive evidence that has been presented by us and so many others for so long.  We are talking about a system of oppression and control.  Even if the members are not inclined to listen to that evidence, I ask that they listen to what Israel says.  Israel talks about maintaining a system of control in order to achieve very particular outcomes on its own part.  Israel is very clear about this.<\/p> <p>  That leads to me addressing some of the questions from Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He might not find these answers particularly useful, but I will explain why they might not be particularly useful.  We are a human rights organisation.  We operate within the context of the framework of international human rights law, and our analysis is within that framework.  I say that to explain an answer to some of the Deputy's specific points.  He was talking about Israel as an apartheid state.  That is one of the questions we have been asked since we issued this report.  Are we saying that Israel is an apartheid state?  We are not, and there is a reason for that.  Apartheid is a grave violation of international law, as everybody knows, where one racial group exercises oppression and domination over another racial group.  It is a crime against humanity committed by individuals who perpetrate serious violations in order to maintain such oppression and domination.  Thus, under international law, there is no such thing as an \"apartheid state\" and that is why we have not used that phrase or made that particular finding in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked questions about political solutions to this conflict and whether two-state solutions and other solutions might deliver.  We are asking the international community to step up and go beyond the question of political frameworks that provide solutions and instead start to respond to the very grave crimes and grave human rights violations that are being perpetrated in the midst of this conflict.<\/p><p>As a human rights organisation, we do not comment on political questions such as the legitimacy of any particular state or ideology.  We do not take a position on Israel as a Jewish state or on the rights of Palestinians to an independent state, since we do not take a position on the measures taken by people to exercise their right to self-determination.  We simply cannot do that as an international human rights organisation.  We recognise that both the Jewish and the Palestinian people claim the right to self-determination, but in the context of any process that seeks to arrive at a political solution to this conflict, there needs to be recognition that the promise of a political solution or the dancing with a notion of it, as undertaken by Israel, has been used as cover to build and maintain a system of oppression and control.  We support all efforts to bring an end to that conflict.<\/p><p> Of course we, as individual human beings and as an organisation, support every possible effort that might be brought to bear to provide a solution to this conflict.  It is now many decades since the foundation of the state of Israel and the beginning of the development of this system of oppression and control.  The international community has to recognise that the role it has played so far has granted Israel absolute impunity to continue to commit these grave crimes under international law.  We are now at a point where Israel will suggest that stating that fact is anti-Israeli, as if there is something inherent to Israel as a state that demands or requires that it be permitted to perpetrate these violations.  I cannot imagine anything being more anti-Israeli or against the integrity of any state than the political leaders of that state asserting that it is central to its character that it be allowed to breach international law and violate the human rights and dignity of millions of people, including citizens of the state, to whom it denies equal rights and nationality.<\/p><p> I will move on to some of the other questions.  I am sure Mr. Higazi will want to speak too.  The Deputy asked about comments from one member of Amnesty International in Israel.  The report was produced by Amnesty International's international secretariat.  Our secretary general flew from London to launch the report in east Jerusalem.  Amnesty Israel was not involved in producing any research for the report because that role is reserved for the international secretariat.  Of course individual people, including, perhaps, one individual in Amnesty Israel, might have a different analysis based on elements of the report, from its first reading.  The report is the outcome of four years of exhaustive research and legal analysis that have been carried out by Amnesty International's international secretariat.  It chimes with and accords fully with findings made by other leading international rights organisations.  It accords with a view, as articulated by Deputy Brady earlier, of a former attorney general of Israel.  Is he anti-Israeli?  It chimes with comments and statements made over many years by senior political leaders from Israel.  For over a decade, former Jewish political leaders of Israel have talked about how Israel has been building a system of apartheid.<\/p><p> Before I hand over to Mr. Higazi to see if he would like to add anything and before I am reminded if there are questions that we have not answered, I return again to one of the key requests we have for this committee.  That request is for the committee to build upon the important work it has done so far and to apply the lens that we have applied.  When one looks at a range of human rights violations, one is looking at a system designed to produce a particular outcome.  It is a system of domination and control that is intended to favour one racial group over another and to discriminate against Palestinian citizens of Israel and Palestinians wherever Israel controls their lives.  In doing so, it perpetrates grave human rights violations.  By any standard, including a simple reading of the apartheid convention, that is apartheid.  Stating that and calling for an end to that system of apartheid is a critical next step.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":146,"content":"<p>I will start with the Chairman's question about Amnesty Israel's position and the head of the Ra'am party.  Our report details how the state of Israel has established a system of institutionalised discrimination, oppression and demolition against the Palestinian people.  This is a clear breach of its obligations under the customary international law.  As the world's largest human rights organisation, Amnesty will not shy away from these findings.  All research and analysis that was carried out was done according to strict research methodology and legal standards, as I explained in my previous interventions.  Recognising the complexity and sensitivity of the issue, Amnesty International engaged with colleagues in Israel as well of members of the Knesset, including reaching out to the Ra'am party, for example.  There were some positive engagements with the Joint List, which is a group of Palestinian parties in the Knesset.  They were involved in the planning and drafting of the report.  Different stages were discussed with them.<\/p> <p>  The report makes for difficult reading.  Our conclusion may be shocking but it cannot be ignored or altered because it is disturbing, because of criticism or opposition, or because it may be inconvenient for some people.  It should prompt intense debate at various levels, including individually, institutionally, in civic society in Israel and everywhere else, and hopefully in the political establishment in Israel and elsewhere.  This is one objective of the report.  Amnesty International's future campaigning, including our colleagues in Amnesty Israel, will seek to dismantle the system of apartheid and institutionalised discrimination against Palestinians, and to uphold human rights for everybody in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, as well as for Palestinian refugees who are continuously denied the right to return.<\/p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, we need to deal with a system and not the symptoms of a system.  There is a story that I tell about this report.  In 2014, I was a researcher with Amnesty International and I wrote a report on the pattern of unlawful killings of Palestinians, including children, by Israeli forces, in the occupied West Bank.  A case study for that report was Nabi Saleh, where there were two unlawful killings in the context of protests against illegal settlements and occupation.  When I went to present the report, I was happy about it because it was a well-researched, detailed investigation, with what I thought were strong recommendations.  One of the leading activists there, Bassem Tamimi, was also a prisoner of conscience in recent years.  He took the report and thanked us for it.  He said that they appreciate Amnesty's work and think it is important.  He opened the report to the recommendations page and said that he sees that we are asking Israel to oppress better and perhaps to kill better, but that we are not dealing with the root causes or dealing with the systematic violations.  That was a wake-up call for me and other colleagues at Amnesty.  To stop the perpetration of the human rights crisis, we need to deal with its root causes.<\/p><p>Last year, Palestinians protested in solidarity with families in Sheikh Jarrah and there was a general strike unseen perhaps since the 1930s.  It involved Palestinians from across historic Palestine in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, from Haifa in the south of Israel all the way through Ramallah, Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank all the way down to Naqab.  All these people protested and one day all held an act of civil disobedience whereby they did not go to school or work.  They did not open shops.  There was a general strike held by Palestinians across the green line.<\/p><p> In a way, this report is a response to that.  Palestinians, through this protest and strike, were saying they were one in defying fragmentation.  Most important, they were saying it was one system of oppression and domination that they were standing against.  The executive summary at the beginning of the report is basically giving that context of the support as a response to Palestinian movement and Palestinians acting under agency, both inside Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories.<\/p><p> I have a point about the system, apartheid and when it started.  The report finds the system of oppression and domination leads to the crime against humanity of apartheid that exists today.  This system consists of four main pillars.  These are the fragmentation of Palestinians into different geographic areas, segregation and control of them within these areas, the dispossession of land and property and the deprivation of basic rights.  That is what exists today.<\/p><p> In the report, we needed to trace the roots of the system to be able to understand the system fully, which is a necessity to be able to tackle the issue more effectively.  Going back to the year of the establishment of the state, there was ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which the Palestinians call Nakba.  There were massacres and forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.  That was, basically, the initial act of fragmentation.  We can then look at how Palestinians who became citizens of Israel were put under military rule while Jewish Israelis were not.  They were segregated into the towns and villages and they were controlled violently, including the right to freedom of movement.  In the early 1950s, there was the establishment of what is now called Israel's land regime, with a body of law and policies that were put in place to take away land and property in a discriminatory and racist manner from Palestinians and not allow them access to it.<\/p><p> In the report we have a case study of Iqrit, a village in the Galilee in the north of Israel, where Palestinians were forcibly displaced from the village, promised a return but the promise was never fulfilled.  The houses were blown up by the Israeli army after the displacement and the lands were taken away and given to Jewish Israeli settlements that were established around the village of Iqrit.  Even up to now, Palestinians of Iqrit are not allowed to return to their homes, although they try.  Again, we have been speaking about agency.  Palestinians from Iqrit have their weddings in the church that remains standing; all the houses were blown up, leaving only the church and cemetery, which remains.  They use these two places and the church in particular whenever they have ceremonies of death or marriage, basically celebrating life and death.  They are continuously trying to return and Israeli authorities are continuously denying them the right of return.  They are internally displaced Palestinians within Israel.<\/p><p> The roots of the system are there but apartheid was not codified under international law as a crime until 1973 and then again when the Rome Statute came in 2002.  The system of oppression and domination started being established around the time of the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 and then with a body of laws, policies and practices put in place against Palestinians afterwards.<\/p><p> It is very important to stress that what is happening today is Israel is perpetrating crimes, including forcible transfer, arbitrary detention and torture, unlawful killings and the deprivation of rights to maintain this system of oppression and domination.  These crimes form part of a widespread and systematic attack against the Palestinian population and, therefore, there is a crime against humanity of apartheid being perpetrated in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories against Palestinians.  The roots of this are very important to highlight and this is what we tried to do in this report through documentation of the laws, policies and practices.<\/p><p> With regard to Senator Black's point, I cannot stress how important it is to have a measure of accountability.  This breaks the impunity that Israel enjoys, particularly with regard to Israeli settlements that continuously expand, including with housing units and infrastructure, leading to the continuous dispossession of Palestinians and the continuous violation of their human rights in a systematic manner on a daily basis.  The settlements are the heart of this myriad of violations that millions of Palestinians suffer on a daily basis.  There has never been accountability.  Palestinians were celebrating when they heard about the occupied territories Bill and they are still very hopeful about it.  Ireland inspires much hope and this is expressed in talking to human rights organisations or people on the ground.  The people of Ireland are seen as people who stand in solidarity with Palestinians in defending their rights.  That will continue.  There is hope and there continues to be hope.<\/p><p> If that Bill is passed, it will be part of the chipping away of one of the pillars of the apartheid system.  We would be chipping away at Israel's impunity when it comes to violating international law.

I asked whether the apartheid system that has been identified by Amnesty International as being operated by Israel will lead us to the same conclusions as we eventually took in dealing with apartheid in South Africa?  The sanctions being called for should be of the same sort as those that eventually brought about the dismantlement of the apartheid regime in South Africa.  As the witnesses know, there is a difference in emphasis.  Some people would say we should put in place sanctions for one particular aspect, such as illegal settlements, or a particular form of behaviour.  The witnesses are saying this is a system and I agree, with the system going right across the state of Israel, not just Gaza and the West Bank.  That system has been operating for a very long time and is institutionalised.<\/p> <p>  It seems that this means the international community is duty-bound to take the same attitude to the Israeli apartheid system as it took to the apartheid system in South Africa?  Do the witnesses agree?  It is the inevitable conclusion but is it the conclusion being drawn by Amnesty International.  It is certainly the conclusion I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#L00600","speaker":"1478"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":153,"content":"<p>If it is okay I will revert to Deputy Clarke's specific point because it is difficult to give her a brief reply.  I would rather come back to colleagues directly if that is okay.  Mr. Higazi will reply to her second question and I will also ask him to speak to Deputy Boyd Barrett's points.<\/p><p>I might frame that by saying, in the first instance that it is, of course, understandable that when people think of apartheid, they think of South Africa.  When we have examined what is happening in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, and indeed, the impact that Israel has on Palestinian refugees in other countries, we are looking at it purely in that context and applying the framework of international law to that context.  We are not comparing it with South Africa.  I am not saying the Deputy is doing that either.  I certainly remember that period in Irish life.  The world was very slow to get to grips with it and to acknowledge what was happening in South Africa.  I hope we will see a better response to what is now being revealed in respect of Israel.  Equally, many of the mechanisms that are currently available were not available then.  The ICC was not available as a mechanism, for instance, to refer the situation in South Africa to.  That is why we are making that specific call.  The situation in Israel should be referred to the ICC and this specific issue should be investigated by the ICC.  There are new mechanisms that are available to us.<\/p><p> To make a general point, I suspect that unless the international community gets serious about taking meaningful action to ensure that Israel is held to account and to challenge the impunity granted to Israel to continue with these egregious, flagrant breaches of international law and the commission of crimes against humanity, it is not going to end.  We agree that until the international community starts to respond in a very different way, it is not going to end.  That is why many of the findings that we made in this report have been made.  It is why we call on this committee, at least as a first step, to accept the findings of this report; to state clearly as a committee that it agrees with the analysis in the report that Israel is perpetrating the crime against humanity of apartheid; to accept and support the recommendations set out in this report, including the recommendations to other states, including Ireland; and to communicate that directly to the Irish Government.  That is something we would very much welcome.<\/p><p> I might refer to Mr. Higazi on the Deputy's specific question about the 2007 study on the situation of Palestinian refugees in other countries, if he is aware of it.  If Mr. Higazi is not aware of it, I am sure he will be able to talk about it in the context of the work we have done over the past four years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#L00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm O'Gorman","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1645488000,"counter":155,"content":"<p>To mark the 73rd anniversary of Nakba, we did a project that is available online.  Perhaps our colleagues in Ireland can share the link to the project with members.  We worked with Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and the West Bank.  It was called Seventy+ Years of Suffocation.  We worked with an award-winning photographer who, along with our researchers, went to speak to Palestinian refugees in refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and the occupied West Bank about the 73 years and what it means to them, and about their return, their situation right now and the suffocation they feel.  Suffocation is mentioned in the title of the project.  It is about the sense of suffocation of being there and stuck in time and a place for 73 years.  That was our last attempt to do such work since the previous reports that we have done.  We also continuously work on the situation of Palestinian refugees in terms of their rights and the respect or violation of their rights in the host countries around Israel and Palestine and also elsewhere.  We can share that project with the committee.  I highly recommend it.  It is hard to describe, but it is a very powerful project.<\/p> <p>  I wish to make a minor point on the comparison with South Africa.  I agree that a system of apartheid cannot be reformed or amended.  It needs to be completely dismantled.  I agree with Mr. O'Gorman that in a way, we are working with the same formula that was applied to apartheid in South Africa, namely, international pressure and sanctions from outside, coupled with support for peaceful resistance from inside.  It is a very crucial formula.  It still holds.  The only addition here, as Mr. O'Gorman has said, is that we have this mechanism of international justice, through the ICC, available to us.  There is a open investigation.  We want the office of the prosecutor to include an investigation into the crime against humanity of apartheid.  We also have universal jurisdiction.  We think it is a very important tool that needs to be mobilised.  We did not see apartheid litigated in South Africa.  We want to see it litigated here.  International justice mechanisms are key when it comes to dismantling Israel's system of apartheid against Palestinians.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDJ2022022200002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Saleh Higazi"},{"type":"speech","time":1645488000,"counter":156,"content":"<p>I think that rather concludes matters for the moment.

He will also be in a position to inform us of what he has done, which is a matter of fact on record, and more importantly, what he intends to do.  We know, in this committee, that he has vociferously made his criticism known on aspects of Israeli Government policy.  Indeed, he has done so in the context of deliberations with this committee.
