In addition, Teagasc commenced a nationwide advertisement campaign giving advice to farmers along with extensive engagement with farmer clients.  <\/p><p>On the 22<sup>nd<\/sup>March 2022, I also announced a Targeted Intervention Package, framed around three pillars to support Irish farming families arising both from events in Ukraine and wider global price volatility.

The Tillage Incentive Scheme incentivises farmers to grow more tillage crops, at a payment rate of &euro;400 per hectare. Farmers must increase their overall tillage and protein crops on their holding and the additional land payable under the scheme must have been in grassland and other crops in 2021. <\/p><p>Support was also provided to incentivise farmers to grow more protein crops, to reduce Ireland's dependency on imported feed. A rate of &euro;300 per hectare for Protein Aid (eligible crops include beans, peas and lupins) and &euro;150 per hectare for the Protein\/Cereal Mix Crop Scheme.<\/p><p>The land declared on farmers' 2022 BPS application is the basis for eligibility for these schemes.

The first of these was a Brexit Temporary Fleet Tie-up Scheme which ran from October to December 2021. It made available supports of &euro;4,600 up to &euro;88,700 per month depending on vessel size for vessels to tie-up for a calendar month.

To further assist the fishing fleet in these difficult times, I am allowing each vessel to receive aid for 2 months in 2022.  Already, some 67 vessels availed of the scheme for the month of June, with a further 43 approved for tie-up for July.  <\/p>  <p>  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit Inshore Fisheries Business Model Adjustment Scheme operated over January to March and was availed of by 771 inshore fishing vessel owners at a cost of &euro;2.6 million to assist in adjusting their business to the post Brexit environment. In addition, a Brexit Inshore Marketing Scheme is underway and is investing &euro;600,000 in 2022 in promoting stocks of interest to inshore fishers to support prices at the quayside.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, a &euro;45 million Brexit Processing Capital Support Scheme is open for applications at present, with the aim of supporting the seafood processing sector to engage in transformational change, mitigating the effects of Brexit, and assisting the sector to move further up the supply chain to produce higher value seafood products.  Grants of up to 50% for capital investment are available.  <\/p>  <p>  For coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit Blue Economy Enterprise Development Scheme is open for applications and aims to counter the adverse economic and social consequences of Brexit on businesses operating in the blue economy in our coastal regions.  The scheme offers aid of up to &euro;200,000 for capital investments and also offers aid for training and mentoring. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, a &euro;35 million Brexit Local Authority Marine Infrastructure Scheme is well underway, with grants of &euro;32 million approved for local authorities to renew important local infrastructure that will facilitate both fishing activities and the growth of our blue economy. <\/p>  <p>  Further support schemes are anticipated in coming months, with four awaiting State Aid clearance from the European Commission.

Amendments to the mackerel policy in 2010 and 2017 were introduced following a full review and public consultation. It should be noted that the 2017 policy is subject to a legal challenge in the Courts. <\/p>  <p>  In order to amend Mackerel Policy, I, as Minister, must be satisfied that there is satisfactory evidence of changed circumstances to justify a policy review.  If I consider there is a case for review of any aspect of the policy, it would require due process, involving an assessment of all issues arising, including a full public consultation. <\/p>  <p>  There has been, for the past 20 years or so, intensive competition within the industry for a higher share of the mackerel quota. The EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA) provides for the transfer of 26% of Ireland&rsquo;s mackerel quota to the UK by 2026.  This will only increase demands for a higher share of Ireland&rsquo;s Mackerel quota from all sectors within the fishing fleet.<\/p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the situation is that if there is an increase in the Mackerel quota for any sector in the allocation made available, it must be taken from others who are already facing significant cuts under the TCA. <\/p>  <p>  In accordance with policy, there is an allocation of 400 tonnes of Mackerel for a fishery for smaller vessels (under 15 metre vessels) fishing for Mackerel by means of hooks and line.<\/p>  <p>  The management arrangements, within national policy, for the mackerel hook and line fishery have been on the agenda and discussed with industry representatives at recent meetings of the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC).

A working group involving industry representatives recommended by the QMAC and the Department was put in place and made recommendations for the management of the 2022 Fishery which were supported by the QMAC and which I have approved.   The management arrangements are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.

It is crucial that we have new blood coming into the sector and I am a stroing advocate of generational renewal. New measures to underpin this support for young farmers are planned for the new CAP from 2023.<\/p>  <p>  The CAP Strategic Plan submitted to the EU Commission at the end of December 2021 contains proposed support measures for young farmers.  Under Pillar I of the next CAP Ireland has proposed support for young farmers as a priority category under the National Reserve to provide for an allocation of payment entitlements at the national average value on eligible land for which the young farmer holds no entitlements, or topping up low value entitlements held by the young farmer to the national average.  <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has also proposed utilising the option to implement the Complementary Income Support for Young Farmers.  This scheme will see an additional payment per hectare made to eligible young farmers, subject to a maximum of 50 hectares, for a period of five years.  An amount of &euro;35.5 million will be provided in supports to young farmers each year from 2023 to 2027 under this scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  This will see average payments of some &euro;175 per hectare to eligible young farmers from 2023-2027, compared to the average payment of some &euro;68 per activated payment entitlement under the Young Farmers Scheme 2015-2022.<\/p>  <p>  Under Pillar II of the next CAP, it is proposed that a grant rate for young farmers for Capital Investments will be 60% with an indicative investment ceiling limit to be applied of &euro;90,000 per holding and &euro;160,000 per holding for partnership applications. <\/p>  <p>  This level of grant rate is proposed in order to support young farmers and specifically to enable them to take on any necessary on farm infrastructural improvement work. This 60% grant rate compares favourably to the general 40% rate and is designed to be a significant support for qualified young farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Additional support to young farmers is also provided under the Collaborative Farming Grant Scheme.  The proposed supports for young farmers under the next CAP will be subject to Ireland receiving EU Commission approval for the CAP Strategic Plan.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a range of State backed supports for young farmers.  These include strong taxation measures to assist land mobility and facilitate succession and are worth some &euro;200 million per annum. Succession and the early transfer of family farms is supported by Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax and Stamp Duty exemptions. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Succession Farm Partnership Scheme provides for a &euro;25,000 tax credit over five years to further assist the transfer of land within a partnership structure to encourage earlier transfer of family farms.  Investment and access to land are supported by 100% Stamp Duty Relief for Young Trained Farmers, 100% Stock Relief for Young Trained Farmers and Relief for Long-Term Leasing.  <\/p>  <p>   I make an annual Budget submission to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on matters related to the agri-food sector including the periodic renewal of relevant taxation measures. <\/p>  <p>  On access to finance, the Future Growth Loan Scheme which provides long term investment finance was developed with assisting young farmers among its objectives. The scheme has seen strong demand, with 1,285 loans to the value of &euro;153.4m sanctioned to farmers. <\/p>  <p>   Launched late last year the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme is available through participating banks and credit unions and provides loans to Brexit-impacted Irish businesses for working capital, investment and re-financing. <\/p>  <p>  I am pleased that this loan scheme which replaces the SBCI Working Capital Scheme, comprising the Brexit Loan Scheme and SBCI COVID-19 Working Capital sub-schemes, is available to farmers and fishers as well as food businesses.

The service provides options for landowners and opportunities for young farmers through advice on and facilitation of collaborative farming arrangements. It has been supported by my Department since 2014 and has seen well over 500 arrangements covering approximately 19,000 hectares being facilitated.

supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.\u00a0 Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment,\u00a0a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses,\u00a0as well as additional needs payments, which incorporate exceptional needs payments (ENPs) and urgent needs payments (UNPs).\u00a0<\/p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance\u00a0provides immediate\u00a0assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.\u00a0 The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.\u00a0<\/p><p>Under the SWA scheme,\u00a0my Department can make\u00a0additional needs payments to help meet expenses that\u00a0a person\u00a0cannot pay from\u00a0their weekly income.\u00a0 This is an administrative umbrella term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from a person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>An\u00a0Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.\u00a0 An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time.\u00a0 Decisions on ENPs and SWA supplements are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.<\/p><p>Table 1 shows the number of Basic SWA and supplement recipients in County Cork, at end of June 2021 and 2022.<\/p><p>Table 2 shows the number of ENPs and UNPs paid in County Cork for the

includes those whose jobs were lost due to COVID-19, those already on the Live Register pre-pandemic and those in society that face particular challenges in entering the labour market and sustaining employment. <\/p>  <p>  Since Pathways to Work was launched in July 2021, there have been notable achievements in delivering on the ambition set out in the strategy.\u00a0 Some of the high-level successes include but are not limited to:<\/p>  <p>  - Expanding the capacity of the Public Employment Service across the State;<\/p>  <p>  - Providing funding for an additional 50,000 places in further and higher education;<\/p>  <p>  - Introducing early access to the JobsPlus employer financial incentive in relation to applicants under 30 years of age;<\/p>  <p>  - Launching the Work Placement Experience Programme (WPEP), which is a 6-month, 30 hour per week voluntary work experience programme, for persons out of work for six months or more; and<\/p>  <p>  - Reserving places on public employment programmes for people from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds, including young people.<\/p>  <p>  According to the latest estimates from the CSO&rsquo;s Labour Force Survey (Q1, 2022), the Irish labour market continues to recover strongly, post-COVID.\u00a0 The number of people in employment is now above 2.5 million, the highest level in the history of the State, while participation rates in the economy continue to be above where they stood pre-pandemic, driven primarily by the increase in female participation.\u00a0 Furthermore, the unemployment rate for June stood at 4.8 percent, around pre-pandemic levels.<\/p>  <p>  While these developments are welcome, I am keenly aware that not all groups have benefited equally from the improved labour market.\u00a0 Pathways to Work\u00a0contains the goal of ensuring that all sections of society enjoy better labour market outcomes.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, in order to guarantee robust oversight of Pathways to Work, external oversight of the strategy is entrusted to the Labour Market Advisory Council.\u00a0 I have asked the Council to provide me with a report in the third quarter of this year on its views

together.<\/p>  <p>  The\u00a0Fuel Allowance scheme\u00a0is a means tested payment to assist pensioners and other long-term social welfare dependent householders with\u00a0their\u00a0winter heating costs.\u00a0\u00a0The payment is a contribution towards\u00a0heating costs, it\u00a0is not intended to meet these costs in full.\u00a0 The\u00a0payment is made over the winter season at the weekly rate of\u00a0&euro;33.00 or, if preferred,\u00a0by way of\u00a0two lump sum payments.\u00a0 Only one Fuel Allowance is payable\u00a0per household.\u00a0\u00a0Those who qualify for the payment do not need to reapply annually.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  As at the end of December 2021, there were 374,861 Fuel Allowance recipients.\u00a0 At the end of 2020, the number of recipients was 375,269.\u00a0 Precise information on the number of fuel allowance applications received, disallowed, or where a customer lost their entitlement during the Fuel Allowance season, is not readily available.\u00a0 Common reasons for disallowance, or loss of entitlement, include cessation of the primary scheme payment; where the means of the customer or household exceeds the permissible threshold; the applicant resides with a non-qualified person (for example, someone in employment); or the applicant resides with another person who is already in receipt of fuel allowance. \u00a0Where an application is disallowed or entitlement is lost, it is open to the person to re-apply if there is a change in their circumstances.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.\u00a0 To help mitigate the effects of these rising costs, the Government announced additional expenditure measures of &euro;505 million.\u00a0\u00a0As part of these measures,\u00a0 I announced two additional lump sum payments of &euro;125 in March and &euro;100 in May to households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department operates schemes to help people with the cost of heating their homes.\u00a0 A Heating Supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances that have exceptional heating costs due to ill health, infirmity or a medical condition and are unable to meet those costs out of household income.\u00a0 An Emergency Needs Payment\u00a0 may be made to help a person meet an essential, once-off cost which they are unable to meet out of their own resources, including exceptional heating costs.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  An ENP may also be payable to those not getting a social welfare payment and those on low incomes.\u00a0 Decisions on such payments are made on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I hope this

resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.\u00a0 To qualify for the Fuel Allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including the household

welfare services to meet the challenges and the needs of citizens across the country remains a priority for me and my Department.\u00a0 It is important that the Community Welfare Service (CWS) remains an accessible, flexible, and responsive service to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has maintained staffing levels in the CWS nationwide in recent years during times when demands decreased, reflective of the commitment that I have given to continue to support the delivery of locally based services to customers.\u00a0 The Department\u00a0has introduced innovations this year which have increased efficiency in processing applications for SWA payments. \u00a0These innovations and the maintenance of staffing levels have led to the CWS being in a stronger position to respond to increases in the demand for the service as they occur.\u00a0 This was borne out when there was a surge of claims received arising from significant numbers of displaced people arriving from Ukraine.\u00a0 It is, therefore, anticipated that there is sufficient capacity within the CWS to manage the increased level of claims arising from the promotion of the Additional Needs Payment during the recent advertising campaign. <\/p>  <p>  Having said that, it&rsquo;s important to note that claims activity within the CWS is closely monitored at all times and resources are deployed as necessary.\u00a0 There is now a national organisational structure in place to oversee the operation of the service across the entire country.<\/p>  <p>  Among the innovations that have been introduced to help citizens and to support our Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) where possible, the preparatory work on applications - for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim, is carried out largely by a back-office team. \u00a0The assessment and decision on claims and any further interactions or engagements with other agencies remains the role of locally based CWOs. \u00a0This initiative releases CWOs to focus on delivery of services and from the requirement to undertake administrative tasks and allows for increased capacity for them to meet with customers as required and\/or to process claims.<\/p>  <p>  Please note however that the assessment and decision on claims and any further customer interactions is then carried out by locally based CWOs as it always has been.\u00a0  The delivery of a locally based CWS remains a cornerstone of the service.<\/p>  <p>  This method of processing applications has been found to be very effective in improving service to customers, especially at times of particular pressure, i.e., during periods of staff absence due to the pandemic or a claim intake surge in a particular local area.\u00a0 It allows for flexible processing arrangements, and it has ensured that a swift response is available to customers resulting in a significant decrease in the time waiting for a claim to be paid regardless of the prevailing circumstances in place in any area of the country.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the

The core objective of the public employment service is to help match jobseekers with employment opportunities as the economy recovers from COVID.  This strategy is working - with the unemployment rate now at pre-COVID levels - at 4.8%. <\/p>  <p>  In fact, we now have record numbers of people in the labour force - the highest the State has ever recorded with over 2.5 million people at work in quarter 1, 2022. <\/p>  <p>  This brings its own challenges, with a much tighter labour supply than anticipated.  I am aware that some employers are now facing difficulties recruiting staff.

Currently there are some 186,821 people on the Live Register. <\/p>  <p>  Intreo Employment Services Officers and job coaches work with jobseekers to support them into jobs.  Dedicated Employer Relations Officers work with employers to help meet their recruitment needs.  Since the beginning of the year, 118 recruitment events have taken place, including 23 job fairs.  These include some specific events for the hospitality and construction sectors.  The Department has a dedicated team working under Government's Housing For All, Future Building Initiative to specifically recruit to construction jobs, from jobseekers in Ireland and abroad.  <\/p>  <p>  The Department also has a number of schemes to encourage employers to provide work experience and recruit directly from persons on the Live Register.  Schemes include the Work Placement Experience Programme and JobsPlus.   <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides  an online jobs portal Jobsireland to enable employers to advertise their job vacancies and for jobseekers to apply for jobs.  I encourage all employers with vacancies and anyone looking for work to register on this website.

The objective of the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant is to support carers in their caring role and carers may use the grant in a manner that is appropriate to their needs.

These loan facilities may also be helpful to businesses struggling with increased energy costs.<\/p><p>Microenterprises can also avail of loans of up to &euro;25k from Microfinance Ireland which they may not be able to avail of from commercial lenders.<\/p><p>Separately, my Department is encouraging and supporting firms to make investments in increased energy efficiency and a reduced carbon footprint, through a number of measures available through SEAI, including direct grants such as the support scheme for renewable heat, project assistance grants, the EXEED grant scheme, tax incentives available through the Accelerated Capital Allowance, and funding for energy audits. As an energy intensive sector, engaging with these supports is vital for retail for now and for the future. <\/p><p>Earlier this year, I established a Working Group on the Green Transition under the Retail Forum to work with the sector to support its transition to become a sustainable sector. As a first step, I would encourage all retailers to complete the Climatetoolkit4business to assess their carbon emissions and access supports to reduce their carbon footprint. The toolkit is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. <\/p><p>Through our Local Enterprise Offices the Green for Micro initiative offers mentoring to micro-enterprises looking to become greener. It offers green transition advice and technical support to a wide range of micro-enterprises with 10 or fewer employees, including those operating in the retail sector. This support is free of charge for eligible enterprises and represents the potential for increased efficiencies within companies that adopt these principles.<\/p><p>Additionally, the main purpose of this year&rsquo;s budget will be to address the rising cost of living in the country. Budget 2023 will provide an overall package of &euro;6.7 billion, representing additional public spending of &euro;5.65 billion and taxation measures amounting to &euro;1.05 billion (an increase of &euro;2.2 billion against what was originally budgeted). <\/p><p>I will forward a copy of this correspondence to the Department of Finance also in relation to items raised which fall under the responsibility of that Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1505"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Industrial Development","counter":462,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04200"},{"type":"question","counter":463,"qnumday":176,"qnumall":"[38878\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will provide an update on a project (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1601","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":464,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, the timely provision of appropriate and cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of multinational companies is essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment.

This will be the first Monday in every February, except where St. Brigid&rsquo;s day, the 1st day of February, happens to fall on a Friday, in which case that Friday 1st February will be a public holiday. The Government wants to ensure that the public holiday provides for a long weekend. The first St. Brigid&rsquo;s day public holiday will be Monday 6th February 2023.<\/p><p>An additional public holiday may impact in terms of cost to the Exchequer broadly in two ways. First, it might result in lower tax receipts due to any associated reduction in economic activity. Second, there would be a notional cost in terms of lost labour hours. <\/p><p>Due to lack of data, it is not possible to generate a historical estimate for the impact of a one-off public holiday using Irish data. Previous analysis by the UK Office for National Statistics estimated the economic impact of an additional one-off public holiday would reduce annual gross national income by between 0.3% and 0.4%. Assuming that this reduction in economic activity is passed through in terms of reduced tax revenue on a pro rate basis &ndash; which may not be the case &ndash; this would indicate a cost to the Exchequer of between &euro;220 million and &euro;300 million. This estimate is based on forecast tax revenue for 2022 of &euro;75.8 billion, from the Department of Finance&rsquo;s spring economic forecasts as set out in the <i>Stability Programme Updae.<\/i><\/p><p>The second cost to the Exchequer would be in terms of lost work hours resulting from the public holiday. While, in practice, a sizeable portion of the public service will continue to work on a public holiday, there will be additional entitlements to time off in lieu. The Revised Estimates for Public Services 2022 estimates an Exchequer pay bill of &euro;21.9 billion for 2022, or just over &euro;60 million per day &ndash; which provides an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of a public holiday.  It is emphasised that these costs are notional in the main and will not lead to additional expenditure for the Exchequer. A large part of the public service is salaried, and so their pay and subsequently the cost to the Exchequer will be the same irrespective of a public holiday. These numbers only provide an indicative estimate of the potential economic cost of an additional public holiday to the Exchequer and do not capture positive aspects including benefits of leisure from an additional day off for many, as well as any further community and societal benefits.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Bodies","counter":468,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":469,"qnumday":178,"qnumall":"[38910\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400072#WRJ04900","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"if he will provide a list of the agencies under the auspices of his Department with underspends for each of the years 2021 and to date in 2022, in tabular form.","asker":"1467","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":470,"content":"<p>The table below sets out the list of underspends incurred by the Agencies under the auspices of this Department at the end of 2021 and against profile to the end of May 2022. <table>    <tr>       <th>Agency name <\/th>       <th>Underspend end 2021 <\/th>       <th>Underspend against profile end May 2022 <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td>&euro;,000 <\/td>       <td>&euro;,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>InterTrade Ireland <\/td>       <td>-11 <\/td>       <td>n\/a <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>IDA Ireland <\/td>       <td>-33,600 <\/td>       <td>-10,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Standards Authority of Ireland <\/td>       <td>-1,973 <\/td>       <td>-190 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Enterprise Ireland* <\/td>       <td>-121,838 <\/td>       <td>-14,832 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Enterprise Office <\/td>       <td>-9,662 <\/td>       <td>n\/a <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Health and Safety Authority <\/td>       <td>-2,333 <\/td>       <td>-180 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Competition and Consumer Protection Commission <\/td>       <td>-2,713 <\/td>       <td>-633 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Personal Injuries Assessment Board <\/td>       <td>-54 <\/td>       <td>n\/a <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority <\/td>       <td>-540 <\/td>       <td>-22 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Total <\/td>       <td>172,724 <\/td>       <td>25,857 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Includes Subheads A7 and B4, which span general supports to indigenous firms and for research and development\/innovation supports.

It also maintains a focus on attracting the next generation of leading MNCs to locate in Ireland, further driving sustainable growth and maximising the impact of FDI in Ireland to 2024 and beyond.<\/p>  <p>  Regional development is at the centre of the IDA&rsquo;s new strategy. IDA is committed to the pursuit of more balanced, compact regional development which can deliver complementary efficiency and equity gains, with the overall impact of helping to advance national development.<\/p>  <p>  During 2021, 249 investments were won, 104 of these were new name investments. Growth in Regions was particularly buoyant with over half of the 249 investments won going to regional locations.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland's results for 2021 showed that total employment in IDA client companies in Ireland now stands at 275,384, up 16,826 on 2020, the highest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) employment level ever. Employment growth was recorded in every region of the country, with the North-East Region showing 5% growth on the previous year.  FDI performance has been particularly strong within the Engineering &amp;amp; Industrial Technologies, Medical Technologies, Technology, International Financial Services and Life Sciences sectors. There are 103 IDA client companies in the Mid-East Region, employing 18,894. 35 of these companies are in County Louth, directly employing over 4,588 people.   <\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland recently announced that it has acquired two landbanks in Co Louth.  The land acquisitions, with a combined total of 149 acres, situated at the townland of Killally, in Dundalk and Mell in Drogheda form part of IDA&rsquo;s long term strategic plans to position Louth and the wider North-East region to compete for FDI investment. <\/p>  <p>  Both sets of lands have been added to the IDA marketing database. A review is underway with respect to further servicing considerations and best positioning of the landbanks to potential FDI investment opportunities. With respect to lands in Drogheda, a concept review for an Advanced Building Solution is progressing.  <\/p>  <p>  The timely provision of appropriate, cost-effective property and infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of MNCs remains essential to winning Foreign Direct Investment. IDA&rsquo;s regional property programme ensures the continued supply of land, buildings and infrastructure in regional locations to meet the needs of current and prospective clients.  A robust property and infrastructure ecosystem can be the key differentiator in winning FDI projects.  IDA Ireland is pleased to have acquired these two landbanks enhancing the offering in the North-East.  Over the last five years, IDA&rsquo;s Regional Property Programme enabled the winning of capital-intensive projects of significant scale to regional locations. IDA will continue to work with commercial property developers and Local Authorities to market other property solutions across all regions where they exist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400073#WRK02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Policy","counter":500,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400073#WRK02100"},{"type":"question","counter":501,"qnumday":189,"qnumall":"[39161\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400073#WRK02200","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the engagement that there has been recently in relation to progressing the M1 Dublin-Belfast corridor as a business and investment location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":502,"content":"<p>The Dublin Belfast Economic Corridor initiative is a collaborative project led by a network involving eight local authorities, North and South of the border, Dublin City University and Ulster University.

It also sets out the national and international policy context for mineral exploration and mining, identifying the role minerals will play in helping\u00a0Ireland meet\u00a0its international goals and commitments, including the European Green Deal, Circular Economy Action Plan, Raw Materials Initiative and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. <\/p><p>Bauxite is among a number of minerals and metals used in the manufacture of batteries. The final draft of the new EU Batteries Regulation which has been under negotiation since April, aims to ensure that batteries placed on the EU market should become sustainable, high-performing and safe throughout their life cycle. This includes producing batteries with the lowest possible environmental impact, using materials obtained in full respect of human rights as well as social and ecological standards, and ensuring they are long-lasting and safe, and aiming for them at end of life to be repurposed, remanufactured or recycled, feeding valuable materials back into the economy. Supply chain aspects are also addressed by requiring new due diligence policies for certain batteries placed on the single market, and empowering EU Commission review in respect of that obligation so as to address social and environmental risks inherent in the extraction, processing and trading of certain raw materials for battery manufacturing purposes.<\/p><p>Advocacy by certain international human rights organisations over the past number of years has highlighted the social and environmental impacts including human rights abuses, of bauxite mining in Guinea, as well as the scope for and extent of responsible sourcing of aluminium by, for example, car manufacturers.\u00a0 More recently, a coalition including Human Rights Watch, and Amnesty International, has called on the EU to ensure the proposed EU Regulation would require responsible sourcing by importers and manufacturers of materials including bauxite used in batteries.<\/p><p>Materials management and the sustainable and responsible sourcing and use of critical raw materials are central to our vision for minerals and mining in Ireland and are key components of the circular economy transition. Bauxite is included on the 2020 List of Critical Raw Materials accompanying the\u00a0European Commission's Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials: &lsquo;Critical Raw Materials Resilience: Charting a Path towards greater Security and Sustainability', which also\u00a0considered the use of critical raw materials for strategic technologies and sectors from the 2030 and 2050 perspectives. The Action Plan proposes actions to reduce Europe's dependency on third countries, diversifying supply from both primary and secondary sources and improving resource efficiency and circularity while promoting responsible global sourcing.\u00a0 In this regard, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2020 'Al Source' research paper examined<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>the potential to recover other valuable minerals from bauxite residues such as those which are produced at Aughinish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400073#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"question","counter":524,"qnumday":198,"qnumall":"[38837\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400073#WRK04012","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"his views on the ongoing importation of coal from the Cerrej&oacute;n coal mines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":525,"content":"<p>I have no function in purchasing coal.

The NTA&rsquo;s 2022 driver survey shows that 93% of drivers are now working but only 29% currently undertake &ldquo;night work&rdquo;.  30% of drivers (up from 17% in 2019) reported that they would consider doing &ldquo;night work&rdquo; if the relevant fares were to increase.  In recognition of this, the proposed fare increases have been weighted in favour of the premium rate that can be charged for journeys between 8.00pm to 8.00am, as well as on Sundays and public holidays. The increase in cents\/euro for each taxi user per journey is not substantial; however, the cumulative impact is significant for drivers, and the weighting in the increase has been designed so as to encourage more drivers to operate during these periods and also encourage drivers who may still not have come back since the pandemic, to re-activate their licences.<\/p>  <p>  Whilst the NTA has statutory responsibility for regulating the SPSV industry, taxi drivers are self-employed individuals and, as such, decide on their own business strategies within the regulatory framework, including choosing the times at which they operate.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department and the NTA previously introduced a number of supports during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce the costs for licensed SPSVs to continue in the industry during this very difficult period.  The SPSV motor tax refund scheme was introduced as an additional financial support to assist the SPSV industry in its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. I announced this support on 9 June 2021 and an allocation of &euro;2m in funding was provided.  The Scheme commenced on 1 September 2021 ensuring that SPSV licence holders could receive a reimbursement of &euro;95 for their SPSV Motor Tax. The Scheme will end on 31 August 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA also introduced the NCT Initial Test Fee Waiver Scheme for the SPSV sector on September 1st 2021, with funding of &euro;1.5m from my Department.  As a result, SPSVs presenting for the NCT received, and continue to receive, this test for free.  This Scheme also ends on 31 August 2022.<\/p>  <p>  The NTA extended vehicle age limits several times during the pandemic, with standard age limits for taxis and hackneys now waived through to end-2022, thereby ensuring no operator exits the industry simply because of the need to replace a vehicle.  The NTA also introduced a regulatory measure to allow licence holders to be inactive for 24 months (previously 12 months) to allow them to remain attached to the industry with no associated costs during this very uncertain period. It is hoped that a significant proportion of these licensees will return now that demand for services is increasing.<\/p>  <p>  Supports are available to drivers wishing to change their vehicles.  I allocated &euro;2m to the wheelchair accessible grant scheme for this year (WAV22).  Under this Scheme, the NTA informed me recently that 102 new WAV licences have been added to the SPSV fleet to date in 2022, and 26 replacement vehicles have been upgraded. <\/p>  <p>  I remain committed to supporting the transition of the SPSV fleet towards zero\/low-emission vehicles. The electric small public service vehicle (eSPSV) grant scheme was put in place to support the greening of the taxi sector. The Scheme is funded by my Department and administered by the NTA. The SPSV industry is regarded as a champion in the normalisation of electric vehicle use, and &euro;15m was allocated in 2022 to support the industry to switch to electric.<\/p>  <p>  eSPSV22 was paused for new applications in April to allow operators with grant offers the time to finalise their car purchase and draw down funding. The Department announced on 26 June 2022 that eSPSV22 will re-open for applications on 1 August, and the application form will be published on the NTA's website that same day. Applications will be accepted up to 30 November 2022 for this Scheme, with no extension being considered.  Vehicles must be licensed (passed the suitability inspection) by 31 December 2022 to get the funding. If this has not happened, operators must wait and apply to any future grant Schemes which might be launched by the Department. <\/p>  <p>  You may be aware that Microfinance Ireland is still providing the so-called eSPSV Business Loan, which is available to support SPSV owners that are unable to secure finance from banks and asset finance providers, and are availing of the eSPSV Grant Scheme to replace their vehicle with a more sustainable model (electric\/hybrid).  These loans range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;25,000, with a fixed interest rate of 4.5% if submitted through a Local Enterprise Office, and with no additional fees or charges.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise that rising fuel costs are a significant challenge for all sectors and, that is why the Government announced on March 9th last, a temporary reduction in fuel-related excise duties of 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel.  These reductions, which were due to finish at the end of August, will be extended until Budget Day on September 27th, at an additional cost of circa &euro;80 million, and should help reduce the operating costs of all private and commercial vehicle owners, including non-electric SPSV operators.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Haulage Industry","counter":651,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":652,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[39239\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the mitigations that are being considered to reduce costs for the haulage industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":653,"content":"<p>The Ukraine crisis &ndash; and matters arising from it &ndash; continue to adversely affect European and Global oil markets, causing a sustained increase in the price of crude and in the price of refined products on the retail market. <\/p>  <p>  Increasing costs is not limited to a specific sector and we are now seeing the development of a much broader issue of rising costs impacting across many sectors and affecting society in general. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of the important role that the haulage sector plays in maintaining a fully functioning supply chain and supporting our economy, the Government approved specific financial support for the sector via the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme (the Scheme) in March 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme provided a temporary financial support of &euro;100 per week, for eight weeks, for each eligible heavy goods vehicle authorised on the licence of a road haulage operator as of 11 March 2022. It was administered by the Department of Transport, and it is now closed. There was good uptake of the Scheme, with over &euro;15 million paid out to nearly 3,000 operators.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Diesel Rebate Scheme (DRS) remains available to licensed haulage operators in respect of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes. At diesel prices over &euro;1.43 (including VAT), the maximum rebate of 7.5 cent per litre is provided. It has always been the case that some operators that are eligible for the DRS do not take it up. The Department would strongly encourage all such operators to make the most of the supports that are available. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, tax debt &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; during the COVID crisis remains at an interest rate of 0% for the remainder of this year.<\/p>  <p>  More generally, the Government has also acted to offset the rising cost of fuel through a reduction in Excise on fuels - a reduction of 20 cent on petrol and 15 cent on diesel fuel. While this measure (announced in early March 2022) was originally proposed to last until 31 August 2022 the Government has extended it out to Budget Day 2022. This measure provides assistance to all citizens and businesses to help mitigate the impact of recent fuel price increases.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, it should be noted that the causes of the current fuel price pressures are not within the control of Government and are being directly influenced by external factors, including the Ukraine crisis. Unfortunately, we must accept that it will not be possible to fully insulate citizens and businesses from the impact of these fuel price increases. <\/p>  <p>  Since early March with the benefit of the excise reduction, 8 weeks support under the Licensed Haulage Support Scheme and the ongoing Diesel Rebate relief, haulage businesses will have had the opportunity to revise and renegotiate contracts with their clients in order to reflect increased prices, as is an unfortunate reality in all sectors across the economy.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has limited resources but through the Excise measure, as well as the Licensed Haulage Emergency Support Scheme, it has responded to help to ease the impact of these price increases. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1578"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bus Services","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM03200"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[39240\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400075#WRM03300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the mitigations that are being considered to reduce costs for commercial bus operators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>Licensed bus and coach operators are an integral part of the overall public transport system, particularly in areas around the country which are not covered by existing public service bus and rail services.

I would like to see the 20% fare reduction continue into 2023; however, I am acutely aware of the competing pressures across the system and the finite Exchequer resources. The funding implications of all measures must be considered in the round so I will work closely with Minister McGrath and other Government colleagues in the context of the 2023 Estimates process to see what we can do with regard to supporting public transport services. <\/p><p>It should be noted that the 20% fare reduction comes on top of several other measures that we are progressing to encourage greater public transport patronage. For instance, the Young Adult Card, which provides an average 50% fare discount for those aged between 19 and 23 on both PSO and commercial services. As well as the TFI 90 Minute Fares scheme which means that adults now pay &euro;2, young adults pay &euro;1, and children pay just 65 cent to travel for up to 90 minutes on Dublin Bus, Luas and most DART, commuter rail and Go-Ahead Ireland services in Dublin. <\/p><p>While fare reductions are to be welcomed, investment in additional services is also critical. For this reason, I am committed to progressing core projects like BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and DART+ as well as improving existing services across the country.<\/p><p>The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.

The incentive gives a refund on Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax paid in the State over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. Section 477C Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 outlines the definitions and conditions that apply to the scheme.<\/p><p>As the Deputy has referenced, in order to avail of the HTB incentive, the loan-to-value ratio (LTV) for a property must be 70% or more. In the case of a self build residence, the lender will apply a valuation using the Central Bank of Ireland's macro prudential mortgage rules, which consists of the aggregate of the market value of the land and the estimated costs of construction. It should be noted that the Central Bank is independent in the decision of its macro prudential rules.<\/p><p>The HTB scheme, as announced in Budget 2017, was initially intended to be limited to persons who had mortgages with a minimum LTV of 80%.  However, Central Bank data indicated that a sizeable number of first-time buyers take out a mortgage with a LTV of less than 80%. As such, It was decided to amend the scheme in the Finance Bill to set the minimum LTV at 70% so as to ensure that first-time buyers did not feel compelled to borrow larger amounts than they would have otherwise in order to qualify for the scheme.<\/p><p>According to published Revenue statistics, from the inception of the scheme to 30 June 2022, self-builds have represented 25.48% of approved claims. However, to end 2021, the proportion of claims in the 70% to 85% LTV bands are much higher for self-builds, accounting for more than 40% of all claims. The nature of self-builds is such that an applicant may already own the land on which the house is built which means that they are likely to need to borrow only in relation to construction costs.<\/p><p>Individuals who are in the fortunate position of being able to avail of a mortgage at a lower loan-to-value ratio than 70% are considered to have sufficient resources to more than meet the deposit requirements of the macro-prudential rules and thus less in need of assistance from the Exchequer. The objective of the scheme is to stimulate the housing market at the entry level and not to provide supports to individuals who are seeking houses at the upper ends of the market.<\/p><p>It is not at all clear that it would be fair or equitable to allow for different eligibility criteria with regard to LTV ratios in respect of self-build properties vis-&aacute;-vis that which applies to all other new build homes. As such, I do not currently plan to amend the scheme in the manner that has been suggested by the Deputy.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that work by external consultants, Mazars, on the review of HTB is nearing completion. The outcome of this comprehensive review will help to inform decisions on the future of the scheme beyond its current sunset date of 31 December 2022. However, this is a matter that will fall to be considered by Government in the context of the Budget 2023 process and it would not be appropriate for me to offer further comment at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Insurance Industry","counter":770,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO03500"},{"type":"question","counter":771,"qnumday":284,"qnumall":"[39162\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO03600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the engagement by his Department and Government agencies with foreign or overseas insurance companies with a view to increasing the number of providers in the public liability insurance market in the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":772,"content":"<p>Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government as evidenced by the fact that implementation of the <i>Action Plan on Insurance Reform<\/i>is overseen by the Cabinet Sub-Group on insurance reform.

As part of this, the Office is working closely with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market, or persuading current incumbents to expand their risk appetite. This will, in the first instance, target providers who offer insurance in areas which have been identified as &lsquo;pinch-points&rsquo; in the Irish market, such as the leisure sector and other sectors having difficulty in obtaining public liability insurance. Due to the successes of the Government reform agenda, such as the implementation of the Personal Injuries Guidelines which have now reduced awards by an average of 40 per cent, I am confident that the IDA now has a very positive message to deliver. Upcoming developments, such as the reform of the Duty of Care, will further enhance this by addressing the issue of &lsquo;slips, trips and falls&rsquo; which is particularly prevalent in high-footfall\/high-risk public-facing sectors. There are positive indications of some firms expanding their risk appetite into a number of these areas. <\/p><p>Finally, the recent NCID report contains much that is encouraging.

This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).<\/p>  <p>  Nevertheless, this Government is continuing to prioritise insurance reform through the whole-of-Government Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The Personal Injuries Guidelines represent a key achievement of this reform agenda, with recent data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board indicating that the overall average award has fallen by 42 per cent compared to awards made in 2020 under the Book of Quantum. Given this pace of reform, and the many other measures being implemented, it is necessary for the insurance industry to pass on benefits to its hard-pressed customers. Both Minister of State Fleming and I have been clear on these points and have been holding the insurance sector to account, in so far as it is permissible, on commitments made.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  In this regard, Minister of State Fleming has met individually with the CEOs of the eight main insurers in the Irish market on a number of occasions\u00a0since the adoption of the Guidelines. In these meetings, and in ongoing engagement with industry, Minister of State Fleming has consistently stressed the importance of insurers reflecting lower claims costs through reduced premiums. These engagements have been positive, with insurers confirming their commitment to passing on savings from the Guidelines. During these meetings, it was also impressed upon insurers the need to expand their risk appetite into &lsquo;pinch-point&rsquo; sectors that are experiencing issues with availability and affordability of cover.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the National Claims Information Database (NCID) contains a wealth of information on premium prices and claims costs, and is unique in Europe in terms of the transparency it brings to the insurance sector. Following the introduction of the Guidelines, the Central Bank has amended the NCID data specification and will collect further claim settlement data. I look forward to the publication of the fourth Private Motor Report later this year, which will provide data up to the end of 2021, and should show some initial insight into the impact of the Guidelines. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to note that it will take time for the Guidelines to take effect, particularly in terms of Court settlements, as there are still a number of existing claims before the Courts which will be assessed under the Book of Quantum. In addition, buy-in from all stakeholders is vital if the Guidelines are to have the expected effect, and it will take a period of time for their true impact to be felt. In the meantime, the Government will continue to engage with stakeholders in relation to their use, as well as with the Central Bank with regards to enhancing the NCID to monitor their impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":780,"qnumday":287,"qnumall":"[39165\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the legislative changes that are planned or are underway to ensure a reduction in insurance premiums for customers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"question","counter":781,"qnumday":288,"qnumall":"[39166\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO04600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the work that is being carried out under the action plan for insurance reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":782,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together.<\/p>  <p>At the outset, it is important to note that neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can direct the pricing or provision of insurance products, as this is a commercial matter which individual companies assess on a case-by-case basis. This position is reinforced by the EU Single Market framework for insurance (the Solvency II Directive).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Nonetheless, this Government recognises the concerns felt by many groups regarding the cost and availability of insurance, and has therefore prioritised insurance reform via the Action Plan for Insurance Reform which was published in December 2020. As the Deputy may be aware, the Government published the second Action Plan for Insurance Reform Implementation Report in March this year, which shows that work is progressing well to implement these important reforms, with 80 per cent of the actions already being delivered.<\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan is a whole-of-Government strategy contains several initiatives expected to positively impact insurance costs. For example, the Personal Injuries Guidelines (implemented in April 2021) have significantly lowered award levels for many common injuries, with the latest data from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) indicating that the overall average award has reduced by 42 per cent compared to 2020. Consistent implementation of the Guidelines should therefore lead to a reduction in the cost of claims, which is the main driver of the cost of insurance.<\/p>  <p>  Another key development with regard to home and motor insurance costs has been the Central Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Regulations to prohibit price walking from 1 July 2022. This is a form of dual pricing whereby customers are charged higher premiums relative to the expected costs the longer they remain with an insurance provider. This ban is a balanced approach that will protect customers who prefer to stay with their current provider from being subject to a &lsquo;loyalty penalty&rsquo;, while still allowing customers to benefit from discounts from new providers.<\/p>  <p>  Recent legislation (the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022), commenced on 8 July, responds to this development and includes a requirement for the Central Bank of Ireland to submit a report to the Minister for Finance setting out the steps it has taken since regulating price walking. The Act provides for this report to be submitted within an 18-month timeframe from enactment, and for it to be laid before the Oireachtas upon receipt. This will allow for timely oversight of the price walking ban by Government and the Oireachtas, to determine whether further measures need to be taken to address the issue. The legislation also addresses a number of further insurance issues that have arisen since the publication of the Action Plan.<\/p>  <p>  Some of the other achievements to date aimed at reducing costs include:\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  - the establishment of the\u00a0Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market, which aims to lower costs by promoting greater competition in the Irish market;\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  - the enhancement of the enforcement powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) through the Competition (Amendment) Act 2022; and<\/p>  <p>  - measures to reduce fraud, including the enactment of the\u00a0Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021, which places perjury on a statutory footing for the first time.<\/p>  <p>  Work is continuing across Government to drive forward the outstanding aspects of the Action Plan. This includes further legislative changes intended to reduce costs, including:<\/p>  <p>  - the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill 2022, which will strengthen the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to ensure more cases settle at that stage instead of proceeding to costlier litigation (this is under the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment); and<\/p>  <p>  - the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022, which will contain amendments to the Occupiers&rsquo; Liability Act 1995 to rebalance the duty of care (this is under the responsibility of the Minister for Justice). <\/p>  <p>  It is my belief that the overall implementation of the Action Plan should help to improve both the cost and availability of insurance. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, I would also note that recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that average private motor insurance prices have fallen by 41 per cent since their peak in July 2016, and it is my hope that these ongoing reforms will bolster this downward trend in the wider insurance market, to the benefit of consumers, businesses and community groups.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":783,"content":"<p>Question No. 288 answered with Question No. 287.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":785,"qnumday":289,"qnumall":"[39167\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400077#WRO05000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he will provide an update on the work of the Office for the Promotion of Competition in the Insurance Market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":786,"content":"<p>Insurance reform is a key priority for this Government as evidenced by the fact that implementation of the Action Plan on Insurance Reform is overseen by the Cabinet Sub-Group on insurance reform.

Its aims are to help expand the risk appetite of existing insurers and explore opportunities for new market entrants in order to increase the availability of insurance. In that regard, the Office is working closely with IDA Ireland to help leverage the ongoing insurance reforms with the aim of targeting new entrants to the Irish market or encouraging current incumbents to expand into underserved areas. Since its establishment, the Office has held over 90 meetings with a wide range of stakeholders including insurance companies, voluntary groups and representative bodies on issues surrounding competition. Minister Fleming also met with the CEOs of the major insurance providers in Ireland, and they have confirmed that they are passing on savings achieved as a result of Government reforms to customers. The Office has also cooperated with the Central Bank to create a databank for new market entrants, which was launched on 8 February 2022. This databank is an additional source of information for insurance providers who are considering entering the Irish market, as it provides &lsquo;one-stop&rsquo; access to key sources of information on insurance in Ireland, and showcases the high-quality work being done in data collection by the Central Bank, such as the National Claims Information Database (NCID).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Through initiatives such as the Action Plan, this Government is committed to securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance in Ireland.

Loss relief works by allowing a deduction for losses incurred in one accounting period against profits earned in another period.<\/p>  <p>  I note that\u00a0section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 precludes Revenue officials from directly or indirectly disclosing taxpayer information to third parties unless this is specifically provided for in legislation. Therefore it is not possible to provide estimates based on such a small cohort of taxpayers.\u00a0 However, based\u00a0on publicly available information as to the bank&rsquo;s profitability levels, a limit of 25% or 50% on the tax losses forward that can be used in one year would likely not yield significant additional tax, due to the amounts of losses forward available to the banks.<\/p>  <p>  A five-year absolute limit on the carry forward of losses would mean that the banks would no longer be able to use the historic losses that are being carried forward since the financial crisis. The likely additional tax yield from such a measure would depend on the banks future profitability levels which cannot be accurately estimated at present.<\/p>  <p>  The value of these tax losses to the State is realised through share sales. The banks share prices recognise a certain value for the tax losses and as such the State will continue to receive value for the balance of tax losses as future sell-downs complete. There would be a negative impact on the valuation of the State&rsquo;s investments in the banks from a change in tax treatment of losses carried forward.<\/p>  <p>  Despite the scale of losses accumulated, the banks contribute to the Exchequer through the financial institutions levy.

Following the Revised Estimates in December 2021, &euro;3.9 billion of this funding remained unallocated. This contingency is held in reserve centrally to allow Government flexibility to respond to emerging needs during the year. <\/p><p>In February 2022, the Government announced a suite of measures to assist with costs of living pressures. This included the Electricity Credit to domestic account holders, which had an estimated cost of &euro;400 million. This required a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, given the scale of this amount in relation to the original Estimate for Vote 29. This Supplementary Estimate was brought before the D&aacute;il in March to provide an additional allocation of &euro;271 million with the remaining cost funded through reallocation of existing Vote 29 resources. Following this development, the remaining contingency balance stood at just under &euro;3.7 billion. <\/p><p>While this is the only draw down from the contingency funding allocated in Departmental Estimates in the first six months of 2022, there are significant pressures and commitments on the remaining funding including:<\/p><p>1.

This includes income and employment support schemes in the Department of Social Protection, Department of Health Covid-19 response, the targeted Commercial Rates Waiver for Q1 2022 and Department of Education Covid response measures.  These Covid-19 expenditure pressures are evident in the end June expenditure reported in the Fiscal Monitor with gross current expenditure in the Department of Social Protection &euro;292 million ahead of profile and &euro;284 million ahead of profile in the Department of Health. <\/p><p>2. Additional allocations may be required to fund the other cost of living measures announced in throughout the first six months of 2022.<\/p><p>3. Costs related to the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine will also need to be provided. Ultimate costs will depend on the numbers of refugees arriving, the length of stay, labour market participation over time and the accommodation solutions provided. There is considerable uncertainty in relation to these elements and it is too early to say how much will be required from the contingency at this point. To date approximately &euro;186 million has been spent across a number of Departments. <\/p><p>4.

It also provides for the transposition of Directive (EU) 2019\/1937 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law. The Bill provides for enhanced protections, notably:<\/p>  <p>  - the extension of the existing protections of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to a wider cohort including volunteers, shareholders, persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, and persons going through a recruitment process or in pre-contractual negotiations,<\/p>  <p>  - reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts,<\/p>  <p>  - access to interim relief at the Circuit Court against penalisation, and <\/p>  <p>  - providing for criminal penalties for penalisation.<\/p>  <p>  Following a recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report and at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in February of this year, I signalled my intent to consider how to make provision for retrospective protection where possible. At each stage when this Bill has been considered, I have updated members of the House on progress in this regard, and my commitment to go as far as possible to provide retrospective protection, where possible, to persons who have reported relevant wrongdoing within the meaning of the Act prior to the Bill's forthcoming enactment. In light of my instruction to provide retrospective protection as broadly as possible, the amendments required careful consideration by my officials in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. The amendments introduced at Committee Stage in the Seanad fulfil the commitment I gave to the Houses on this matter.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments I have introduced provide that a worker who reports a relevant wrongdoing before the Bill is enacted but suffers penalisation after the Bill is enacted is entitled to the enhanced protections of the amended legislation, including the reversal of burden of proof in civil proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and the courts.<\/p>  <p>  The amendments further provide that a worker (as defined in the 2014 Act) who reports a relevant wrongdoing and suffers penalisation before the Bill is enacted but has not initiated proceedings at the WRC or the courts will be entitled to the reversal of the burden of proof in such proceedings.  I am satisfied in light of my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the Office of the Attorney General that it is not possible to apply those changes to existing proceedings, since that would involve interfering with already existing litigation.  To seek to apply new rules to cases where proceedings have already issued would be unfair and give rise to legal issues.  This is especially so where there is already a Court decision in place.<\/p>  <p>  Section 13 of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that, \"If a person causes detriment to another person because the other person or a third person made a protected disclosure, the person to whom the detriment is caused has a right of action in tort against the person by whom the detriment is caused\". <\/p>  <p>  Section 22 of the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill provides for the insertion of a new subsection - (2B) -  into section 13 of the 2014 Act, which provides that, \"In any proceedings under this section in respect of alleged detriment caused to a person, the detriment so caused shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to have been caused as a result of the person or another person having made a protected disclosure, unless the person whom it is alleged caused the detriment proves that the act or omission concerned was based on duly justified grounds.\"<\/p>  <p>  The effect of subsection (2B) is to reverse the burden of proof in any tort proceedings taken under section 13, so that the court must assume that the alleged detriment occurred because of a protected disclosure, unless the defendant can prove otherwise. This  is to give effect to Article 21.5 of the Directive.<\/p>  <p>  Paragraphs 3 and 5 of Schedule 7 of the Bill provide for the retrospective application of this provision to persons who have reported before the enactment of the Bill but suffer retaliation after enactment. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 7 provides for the retrospective application of this provision to persons who have reported and suffered penalisation before enactment but have not initiated proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts. Without these provisions in Schedule 7, Section 13(2B) will not have any retrospective application, i.e. it will only apply to protected disclosures made after the enactment of the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400079#WRQ04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1459"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":897,"content":"<p>Question No. 326 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":898,"content":"<p>Question No. 327 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":899,"content":"<p>Question No. 328 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":900,"content":"<p>Question No. 329 answered with Question No. 325.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flood Risk Management","counter":901,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400079#WRQ04800"},{"type":"question","counter":902,"qnumday":330,"qnumall":"[39040\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400079#WRQ04900","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"if the Minister of State at his Department or the Office of Public Works have yet convened a meeting with the Department of Transport and Mayo County Council in relation to funding the South Mayo flood relief scheme that is urgently needed; if not, when this meeting will be convened; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":903,"content":"<p>Local flooding and coastal erosion issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address.

While the views of coastal communities are important, it is likely that they will be engaged with to ascertain their practical views as part of policy responses emerging on foot of the scoping report.<\/p><p>The Inter-Departmental Group Steering Group last met in June 2022 and has now advanced the drafting and finalising of its report considerably. \u00a0This Report will be finalised in the coming months and will then be presented to Government for their consideration. <table>    <tr>       <th>National Coastal Change Zone Management Steering Group<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Office of Public Works<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Transport<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Met &Eacute;ireann<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SRA (Southern Regional Authority)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>GSI (Geological Survey Ireland)<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>The County and City Management Association<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Local Government Management Authority<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Climate Action Regional Office<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of the Environment, Climate, and Communications<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>National Parks and Wildlife Service<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400080#WRR04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Policy","counter":959,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400080#WRR04925"},{"type":"question","counter":960,"qnumday":348,"qnumall":"[38870\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400080#WRR04950","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the measures that have been put in place to assist local authorities and approved housing bodies to deal with construction sector inflation for contracts signed pre-2022, since 1 January 2022 and for contracts not yet signed but under consideration whether for construction or turnkey under the social housing investment programme, the capital assistance scheme, the capital advance leasing facility and the cost-rental equity loan programme.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":961,"content":"<p>Awaiting reply from the Department.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":962,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400080#WRR04969"},{"type":"question","counter":963,"qnumday":349,"qnumall":"[38888\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400080#WRR04975","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of new affordable purchase units that have been delivered in quarter 1 of 2022;

As set out in the rent contribution agreement, this weekly rental contribution must be paid by them so that they remain eligible for the HAP scheme. <\/p><p>Since HAP was rolled out in 2014 to end 2021, HAP support has been ceased for 1,418 tenancies due to tenant differential rent arrears. This represented 1.4% of all tenancies set up during that period. Data in respect of 2022 is not yet available. My Department does not hold data on the number of tenants who have exited HAP due to arrears on a county by county basis, the management of individual HAP tenancy exits is a matter for each individual local authority.<\/p><p>The approach taken by the HAP Shared Services Centre (HAP SSC) has been very effective with minimal levels of rent arrears arising for HAP tenants. In 2019, the scheme had a 96% differential rent collection rate, with minimal arrears arising for tenants or local authorities. At Q4 2021, the scheme had a 99% differential rent collection rate. Therefore, only a very small number of tenants have fallen into difficulty with their differential rent.<\/p><p>During the Covid-19 emergency, the HAP Debt Management Process (DMP) was suspended from March 2020 and partially re-commenced in October 2020. This meant non-payment of differential rent by a tenant during that time did not affect payments to HAP landlords. Tenants were, however, expected to continue to pay their rent with supports available for those financially impacted by Covid.<\/p><p>Following on from the successful roll out of the Covid vaccine programme and the reopening of society, the normal DMP was reinstated from 6 September 2021.<\/p><p>Tenants that incurred arrears during the Covid-19 emergency were given additional time to engage with the HAP Debt Management Unit to clear their arrears, as well as access to payment plans as a specific Covid measure. Under the normal HAP DMP payment plans are not offered or available to tenants at this stage of the process. The HAP SSC has now resumed the standard debt management process.<\/p><p>The National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC), which I chair, was established in December 2021 in line with a commitment set out in <i>Housing for All<\/i>.

A number of measures have been identified and are now being advanced. Three separate subgroups have also been established to focus on specific areas of homelessness prevention. One of these subgroups is tasked with considering the risk of homelessness for HAP\/HHAP tenants in arrears. <\/p><p>HAP tenants in arrears should contact their local authority and the HAP SSC to discuss the options that are available to them to ensure the continuation of their HAP support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400081#WRS04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1042,"content":"<p>Question No. 375 answered with Question No. 374.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1043,"content":"<p>Question No. 376 answered with Question No. 374.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1044,"content":"<p>Question No. 377 answered with Question No. 374.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":1045,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400081#WRS04800"},{"type":"question","counter":1046,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[39221\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400081#WRS04900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of affordable, affordable mortgage, cost rental and council houses including Approved Housing Bodies, that will be delivered in County Louth in 2022; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":1047,"content":"<p>Housing for All, is the Government&rsquo;s plan to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 per year over the next decade.

The majority of these applications have been received in the last 12 months which is strong indication of the appetite and commercial interest in the developing ORE sector in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Foreshore Section of my Department also assesses foreshore consent applications for a range of other proposed activities and developments relating to ports and harbours, strategic infrastructure projects like water and waste water infrastructure, local authorities&rsquo; infrastructural works such as bridges, marinas, coastal protection works, flood relief works, as well as strategically important telecommunications and interconnector projects. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is continuing to prioritise site investigation licence applications linked to a set of seven qualified ORE projects, known as \"relevant projects\" or Phase 1 project, which qualify to make an application to the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications for a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) as part of the transition provisions in the Marine Area Planning Act 2021. Any project in this category granted a MAC by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must then apply for the necessary development permission from An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the new marine planning system.<\/p>  <p>  Each application must be assessed appropriately in accordance with the applicable requirements of domestic and EU law including the EIA Directive, Birds and Habitats Regulations and the Foreshore Act. Over the last eighteen months, my Department has significantly increased its staffing resources in this area, including technical personnel available within the Foreshore Section to address this increasing workload of applications under the Foreshore Act. In parallel, the processes underpinning the statutory assessment processes have been refined allowing the various procedures to run in parallel, where appropriate. This should reduce the average time taken to assess an application. In addition, a panel of external specialist environmental consultants is in operation to assist in the technical assessment of applications. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that my Department is taking a proportionate and responsible approach to processing foreshore licence applications for site investigation licences linked to the proposed development of offshore renewable energy projects pending the update to policy in relation to the management of the Phase 2 for offshore renewable energy, as well as progress with the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority.

At the most recent discussion on the DRC at the UNSC on 29 June, Ireland specifically expressed concern at rising tensions and stressed the importance of regional efforts to address the crisis. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports the efforts of the United Nations, through the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), to reduce violence and instability in DRC, both through our membership of the UNSC and our deployment of personnel to MONUSCO. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been a troop contributing country to MONUSCO, previously MONUC, since 2001. Additionally, Ireland provided &euro;4.9 million in humanitarian assistance to the DRC in 2021, and have committed a further &euro;4.4 million for humanitarian assistance and response in 2022. <\/p>  <p>  The European Union (EU) is currently actively engaged in the DRC and has encouraged the development of a strategic, political resolution to the conflict in eastern DRC.  Ireland has emphasised the importance of the engagement of national and regional organisations and actors to promote peace and stability in DRC and the wider Great Lakes Region, including as a member of UNSC and the EU. The DRC will be among the subjects to be discussed by EU Foreign Ministers when the next meet on 18 July.

As a UNSC member, Ireland will steadfastly encourage efforts by regional and international partners to de-escalate tensions and build trust. Regional cooperation remains essential in the pursuit of peace and security, and Ireland will continue to highlight the importance of the ongoing implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region, and to encourage constructive engagement in the Nairobi peace process and the implementation of the ICGLR Roadmap.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1573"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1122,"content":"<p>Question No. 406 answered with Question No. 402.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ukraine War","counter":1123,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1124,"qnumday":407,"qnumall":"[38885\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a campaign by an organisation (details supplied) and its calls for greater co-ordination and planning, stronger communications and engagement with civil society organisations meeting the needs of people fleeing Ukraine and the communities in which they now live; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

We recognise the value of enlargement as a transformative driver for stability and peace in candidate countries.<\/p><p>There are currently seven recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, Serbia, Ukraine and Moldova. Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia are recognised as potential candidates by the EU. Georgia and Bosnia and Herzegovina have formally submitted applications for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and has indicated an intention to submit a formal application for EU membership during 2022. <\/p><p>On 17 June 2022, the European Commission presented its Opinions on the EU membership applications submitted by Ukraine, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova as invited by the European Council. The Commission recommended that candidate status be granted to Ukraine and Moldova, on the understanding that reforms are taken in a number of areas. It was also recommended that candidate status eventually be granted to Georgia, once a number of priority reforms have been addressed, with the Commission to review progress on all three applications by the end of 2022. Ireland welcomed and supported the 23 June decision of the European Council to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine and to Moldova and potential candidate status to Georgia.<\/p><p>Ireland has long advocated for this outcome and I have strongly supported Ukraine's EU perspective at meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council. As I re-iterated when I met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba in April, Ireland fully supports Ukraine's application for EU membership. President Zelenskyy also expressed his thanks for Ireland being in the leading group of countries supporting Ukraine&rsquo;s candidacy during the Taoiseach&rsquo;s visit to Kyiv on 5-6 July. <\/p><p>We have come together with a group of other Member States with a view to providing political and practical assistance in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s European perspective. I and my officials have also had frequent meetings with representatives of the Ukrainian, Georgian and Moldovan authorities on the issue of EU membership, including with the Embassy teams of those countries here in Ireland. <\/p><p>In the Western Balkans, current issues relating to the enlargement process largely revolve around the commitment to opening Inter-Governmental Conferences (IGCs) with Albania and North Macedonia. The main obstacle to agreement has been Bulgaria&rsquo;s objection to moving ahead with opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia due to bilateral difficulties related to the Macedonian language, the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia, and the implementation of the 2017 Treaty on Good Neighbourly Relations. <\/p><p>Diplomatic efforts led by the outgoing French Presidency have been underway in recent weeks to resolve the issues. On 24 June the Bulgarian Parliament approved a proposal from the French Presidency aimed at resolving the impasse and lifting the veto. Following further discussions, including <i>en marge<\/i>of the NATO Summit in Madrid on 29-30 June, the French Presidency produced a revised proposal which has been accepted by the North Macedonian government and submitted to the country&rsquo;s national assembly for consideration, with a parliamentary vote expected on 15 July. <\/p><p>The issue was discussed during the joint visit of the Minister for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, T.D., with his Finnish counterpart, Tytti Tuppurainen, to Skopje on 4 July with both Ministers emphasising that the latest Presidency proposal represented a clear opportunity for North Macedonia to advance on its European track while safeguarding both the Macedonian language and identity. <\/p><p>Elsewhere, the EU is continuing to encourage greater reform efforts on the part of Serbia and Montenegro, particularly in relation to Rule of Law and promotion of good governance. Serbia&rsquo;s non-alignment with the EU common position relating to Russia&rsquo;s aggression against Ukraine has also been of concern recently.  <\/p><p>The possibility of granting candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina was also discussed at the June European Council meeting. Ireland welcomes that the Commission will be providing a further report on the country&rsquo;s progress in meeting its reform agenda, and looks forward to supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina as it advances further on its European path. <\/p><p>Ireland will continue to support strongly the enlargement process and offer any practical assistance it can to candidate countries engaged in accession negotiations to the EU.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Passport Services","counter":1143,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1144,"qnumday":415,"qnumall":"[39180\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the progress that has been made in relation to the processing of Irish passports; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1145,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[39506\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400083#WRU04300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of staff recruited to the Passport Office each month to date in 2022; the number of passport applications for each type of passport processed each month in 2022; the average waiting time for processing each type of passport application; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1146,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 415 and 424 together.<\/p><p>The Passport Service is already out-performing any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years.

This year the Passport Service is experiencing an unprecedented volume of demand for passports. This is as a direct result of pent-up demand for travel after two years of pandemic-related restrictions.<\/p><p>This level of demand is not unique to Ireland. In countries such as the UK and United States, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to 10 weeks. The Passport Service has decreased the processing times for first time online applications by 40% since March. Processing time for first time online applications now takes 25 working days, down from 40 working days in March. In addition, almost half of adult online renewals are processed within 2 days. The Passport Service is performing at its highest capacity ever and is producing an average of almost 6,000 passports per day.<\/p><p>The current processing times are:<\/p><p>- Online adult renewal - 10 working days<\/p><p>- Online child\/complex renewal - 15 working days<\/p><p>- Online first time application - 25 working days (from 6 June)<\/p><p>- An Post Passport Service - 8 weeks<\/p><p>In order to achieve these type of results and to continue to improve the service, my Department has made an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service.

The addition of these staff has allowed the Passport Service to maintain its current turnaround times in the face of enormous levels of demand.<\/p><p>In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the Passport Service has made important improvements as follows that will help to ensure that passport applications can be processed within turnaround times:<\/p><p>- A large number of the new staff have been assigned to the Customer Service Hub. This has greatly increased the number of calls and webchats being answered and is assisting with customers getting access to the information they need. In recent weeks, the number of calls handled by the Hub has risen to over 2,000 per day.<\/p><p>- In May the Passport Service released two online video guides that provide tips to ensure that passport photos and witnessed consent forms for children are correctly submitted. Passport photos and witnessed consent forms are some of the main reasons that an application may be rejected, so it is important the customers have all the information they need to ensure that these are submitted correctly. These easy-to-follow video guides are available on my Department's website and social media channels and I encourage all applicants to watch them before they submit their application.<\/p><p>- The Passport Service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda signature cannot be verified.

Rising global food prices have been exacerbated by the effective blockade on shipping from Ukraine's ports which has restricted access to wheat and fertilisers. The United Nation&rsquo;s outlook for the coming months highlights twenty global hunger hotspots where humanitarian action is an urgent priority. <\/p>  <p>  In its review of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) published in 2020, the OECD found Ireland to be an excellent humanitarian partner. Ireland is supporting responses worldwide including a strong focus on the 20 hunger hotspots and the 2022 allocation of &euro;126 million for Irish Aid&rsquo;s humanitarian action is substantially higher than 2021. In addition the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine has provided &euro;25 million to assist the World Food Programme&rsquo;s activities in crisis countries. In order to help address the underlying causes of food insecurity Ireland has pledged to invest &euro;800 million by 2027 in improving global food and nutrition systems.<\/p>  <p>  The Horn of Africa, to give one specific example of our response, is experiencing one of the most severe droughts in at least forty years. Responding, my Department has contributed over &euro;48 million in humanitarian support to Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia over the past 18 months. These interventions complement the Irish Aid investment of over &euro;12 million in development funding last year, including in partnership with Irish NGOs.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the region is being supported through Ireland&rsquo;s contributions to multilateral humanitarian action, such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). Ireland prepositions funds with partners such as the CERF which enables them to react immediately to crises as they happen. Since 2021, the CERF has allocated almost $100 million to help drought-affected communities in Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. Ireland is the 8th largest contributor to CERF providing &euro;11.5 million in 2022. Ireland has supported a strong EU response and in April the EU pledged &euro;348 million for 2022 to provide both humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to tackle root causes of food insecurity.<\/p>  <p>  At the UN Security Council Ireland will continue to draw international attention to humanitarian crises. As the informal focal point on Conflict and Hunger on the Security Council, Ireland is a consistent advocate on global food insecurity.

NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.

My officials are examining each of the recommendations and consulting across Government through the Cabinet Committee system.\u00a0 The views of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare will be considered as part of these deliberations.\u00a0 Once we have considered all of these matters in detail and taken on board the views of my Ministerial colleagues, I intend bringing a recommended response and implementation plan to Government.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I\u00a0hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400089#WRAA05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":1504,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[39144\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400089#WRAA06000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if foster care children will be included in the back-to-school allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1505,"content":"<p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn.\u00a0 The scheme operates from June to September each year.<\/p><p>The allowance is payable in respect of eligible children between the ages of 4 and 17 in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid and eligible children between the ages of 18 and 22 who are in full-time second level education and in respect of whom a qualified child allowance is being paid.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance is not payable in respect of foster children as the financial support available to foster parents from Tusla, the foster care allowance, includes assistance with the cost of clothing and footwear for the foster child. <\/p><p>Any changes to the eligibility criteria for the scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context and within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements. <\/p><p>Applications which fall outside the normal rules of the scheme may be considered for an additional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme by the Community Welfare Service.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local Community Welfare Service.\u00a0 There is a National CWS Contact Centre in place &ndash; 0818-607080 &ndash; which will direct callers to the appropriate office.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400089#WRAA06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":1507,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400090#WRBB00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1508,"qnumday":543,"qnumall":"[39145\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400090#WRBB00300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will exclude family means testing for persons who can qualify for the carer&rsquo;s allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1509,"content":"<p>My Department provides a range of income supports for full-time carers including Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.\u00a0Combined spending on all these payments to carers in 2022 is estimated to exceed &euro;1.5 billion.\u00a0<\/p><p>Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is the primary income support through which the Department supports carers in the community.\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance is a payment to people on low incomes who are caring full-time for a person who needs support because of age, disability or illness, including mental illness.\u00a0 The two principal conditions for receipt of\u00a0Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are that full time care\u00a0and\u00a0attention is required and being provided, and that the means test which applies is satisfied.<\/p><p>The conditions attached to payment of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance are consistent with the overall conditions that apply to social assistance payments generally.

Removing the means test for Carer&rsquo;s Allowance would, in effect, create a new universal social protection scheme for those meeting the scheme&rsquo;s basic caring condition. <\/p><p>In Budget 2022, I announced significant\u00a0improvements to the means test\u00a0for Carer's Allowance, in recognition of the vital role that carers play in society.\u00a0These were the first changes to the means test in 14 years.<\/p><p>-  The capital and savings disregard for the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance means assessment was increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000, aligning it with that which

the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.\u00a0 Supports provided under the SWA scheme can consist of a basic weekly payment,\u00a0a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses,\u00a0as well as single additional needs payments.\u00a0<\/p><p>The basic supplementary welfare allowance\u00a0provides immediate\u00a0assistance for those in need who are awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment or do not qualify for payment under other State schemes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Rent supplement provides short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.\u00a0 The scheme ensures that for those who were renting, but whose circumstances have changed due to temporary loss of employment, can continue to meet their rental commitments.<\/p><p>Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make\u00a0additional needs payments to help meet expenses that\u00a0a person\u00a0cannot pay from\u00a0their weekly income.\u00a0 This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments, and certain supplements to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.<\/p><p>The Government has provided funding of &euro;45.75 million\u00a0for the provision of exceptional and urgent needs that are provided for as\u00a0Additional Needs Payment in 2022.\u00a0 A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for SWA Supplements in 2022 (excluding rent supplement).\u00a0 The scheme is demand led and is funded accordingly.\u00a0 The payment is available to anyone who needs it and qualifies, whether the person is currently receiving a social welfare payment or working on a low income.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>An\u00a0Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP) is a single payment to help meet essential, once-off expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.\u00a0 An urgent needs payment (UNP) may be made to persons who may not normally qualify for supplementary welfare allowance but who have an urgent need which they cannot meet from their own resources or where an alternative is not available at that time.\u00a0<\/p><p>Payments are made\u00a0at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation, and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p><p>While statistical information on the SWA schemes is available, it is not collated by Intreo Centre, but a breakdown can be provided by county.\u00a0<\/p><p>Table 1 shows number of Basic SWA applications registered by\u00a0county from March 2022 to June 2022 and the outcomes of these applications in terms of awards and disallows. It does not reflect claims that were withdrawn, cancelled or awaiting further information.<\/p><p>Table 2 shows the number of Additional Needs Payment applications registered by\u00a0county from March 2022 to June 2022 and the outcomes of these applications in terms of awards and disallows.\u00a0It does not reflect claims that were withdrawn, cancelled or awaiting further information.<\/p><p>Table 3 shows the number of Rent Supplement recipients by county at the end of each month for the period 1st March to-date for 2022 (end of June).

Certification for the scheme is by the persons treating physician, in most cases a General Practitioner.<\/p>  <p>  Invalidity Pension is a social insurance payment for people who are deemed permanently incapable of work due to a long-term illness or disability. Eligibility is subject to a medical assessment and PRSI contribution conditionality. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  A person who has an insufficient PRSI contribution record may apply for the appropriate means-tested social assistance scheme (Disability Allowance and the Blind Pension are both social assistance schemes).\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Disability Allowance: is designed to support people with a disability who are aged between 16 and 66, who are habitually resident in the state. Eligibility for Disability Allowance requires that the disability must be expected to last for at least one year, substantially restricting a person&rsquo;s ability to undertake work which would otherwise be suitable for persons of similar age, experience, and qualification.<\/p>  <p>  Blind Pension: is designed to support blind people\/people with a specified level of low vision, aged 18 and up to the age of 66 who are habitually resident in the State. Eligibility for the Blind Pension requires that a person&rsquo;s vision is impaired to such an extent that they cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue in their ordinary occupation. Medical assessment requirements include a medical report from an Ophthalmic Surgeon or an Optometrist.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to other conditions of a particular scheme (e.g. PRSI contributions, age, means) each application for the above schemes are individually assessed, based on the medical information provided by healthcare providers and the claimant.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to note, that each of these schemes have been designed to support a person to enter, return to or retain employment.

In 2022, the allowance paid for each eligible child will be &euro;260 in respect of those aged 4-11 or &euro;385 for children aged 12 years and over.<\/p>  <p>  Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance by Tusla. This allowance is provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child&rsquo;s daily living needs, including the cost of clothing and footwear and school related items. Accordingly, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance is not payable in respect of foster children. <\/p>  <p>  The Foster Care Allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. The allowance is not considered as means for social welfare purposes, and is not subject to tax. <\/p>  <p>  If required, Tusla can also provide additional financial supports to foster carers through either additional or enhanced payments. Additional payments refers to any payment made to a foster carer that exceeds the standard rate of the Fostering Allowance.  Such additional payments may be made in respect of children or young people who have additional needs that are not covered by the standardised Fostering Allowance. Additional payments can only be made where a child has additional medical or educational needs and when authorisation has been received from the Tusla Area Manager. <\/p>  <p>  Enhanced allowances for foster carers can be made when a longer term financial need is identified for additional supports for the child. A maximum of twice the weekly allowance may be paid in respect of children aged between 0-18 years if they require significant care over and above the needs of other children in foster care.  This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has also advised in cases where access visits result in round trips in excess of 150km, an additional financial support payment may be made. Tusla has further advised an additional financial support payment may also be considered where a foster carer must, for reasons set out in child\/young person&rsquo;s care plan, facilitate travel in excess of 300km per week cumulatively.<\/p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge the fact that foster carers are the backbone of our child care services.

Foster carers are paid a weekly allowance, which is a payment to meet the needs of the child in their care. The foster care allowance is currently &euro;325 per week for a child under 12 years of age and &euro;352 per week for a child aged 12 years and over. It is paid in respect of the child and provided in order to allow foster carers to meet all of the child's daily living needs, including food, clothing, basic travel, education costs and hobbies and sports activities.

This includes children who have been diagnosed with significant special needs and require a high level of personal care and supervision.  The purpose of considering an enhanced allowance in these cases is to support foster carers in providing care to these children who have additional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is in respect of and for the benefit of the foster child and therefore must be used to meet the day to day costs associated with looking after the foster child. In considering any enhanced allowance the assessing social worker is required to evidence that the standard fostering allowance does not adequately provide for the cost of caring for the child.<\/p>  <p>  A request for enhanced supports must certified by the Principal Social Worker and approved by the Area Manager following submission of an assessment of the child&rsquo;s needs and supporting documentation.  A review arrangement for the enhanced allowance must be part of the submission for approval.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive a number of targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system. Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care. Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.<\/p>  <p>  Pre-assessment and ongoing training are compulsory for foster carers in order to equip them with the skills and knowledge to provide high quality care. Recognising the specific dynamics and the personal nature of relative care, Tusla addresses the training needs of relatives who are foster carers separately. In addition, Tusla provides funding for the Irish Foster Care Association which offers a range of supports to carers, including advocacy, mediation, training and a telephone advice service.<\/p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla have advised that they have recently engaged with foster carers in a consultation to inform the development of a Strategic Plan on Foster Care.

Core Funding allows for an estimated 19% increase in the total cost base for the sector to be absorbed without any increase to fees for parents. <\/p><p>Core Funding will support the quality of services by better enabling providers to attract and retain staff; establish career structures; introduce or improve other features of provision that are demonstrated to contribute to quality (e.g. non-contact time, planning, training, curriculum implementation). Staff costs comprise on average approximately 70% of services' operating costs. &euro;138 million has been allocated as part of the Core Funding package to contribute to staff costs.  This is in addition to existing income from other funding schemes and parents' fees.<\/p><p>The introduction of fee management measures is one of the recommendations contained in 'Partnership for the Public Good'. Fee management will start with the requirement for providers to maintain fees at or below September 2021 levels to access Core Funding in 2022. This will give parents greater certainty about what they will be charged and ensure that increases to National Childcare Scheme (NCS) subsidies are not absorbed by fee increases. This will be developed further in future years.<\/p><p>Under Core Funding, the vast majority of services will see an increase in funding, and no service will see a decrease in funding. For any service that does experience financial difficulties, a Sustainability Fund will be in place.  This new strand of the Sustainability Fund, linked to Core Funding, will be designed to provide an extra safety net for providers.  This will be open to both private and community providers.<\/p><p>In relation to the workforce, I firmly believe the level of pay for early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners should reflect the value of their work for children, families, society and the economy. <\/p><p>The State is not the employer, and my Department does not set wage levels nor determine staff working conditions. However, I am doing all that is in my power to address the issue.<\/p><p>In particular, I began a process in December 2020 to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions and the suitability of a Joint Labour Committee for the sector. This process culminated in the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for Early Years Services, which began meeting in December 2021. The outcomes of the Joint Labour Committee will be supported by the new Core Funding stream. <\/p><p>In addition, in December 2021, I published &quot;Nurturing Skills: The Workforce Plan for Early Learning and Care and School-Age Childcare, 2022-2028&quot;, which includes commitments to develop career pathways, promote careers in the sector, and strengthen supports for continuing professional development, which will complement efforts to improve pay and conditions of employment in the sector. <\/p><p>Commitments in Nurturing Skills are organised under five pillars:  <\/p><p>-  Establishing a career framework; <\/p><p>-  Raising qualification levels; <\/p><p>-  Developing a national Continuing Professional Development system; <\/p><p>-  Supporting recruitment, retention and diversity; and <\/p><p>-  Moving towards regulation of the workforce. <\/p><p>Successful delivery of commitments under the five pillars will be supported by three &quot;key enablers&quot; that are identified in Nurturing Skills: <\/p><p>-  Improvement in pay and conditions of employment; <\/p><p>-  Coordination of the quality support infrastructure; and  <\/p><p>-  Ongoing engagement with the profession. <\/p><p>A Monitoring Committee is being established with the task of monitoring the implementation of Nurturing Skills. A comprehensive Implementation Plan is included within Nurturing Skills and covers the first phase of implementation from 2022-2024.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Funding","counter":1688,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1689,"qnumday":605,"qnumall":"[39225\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01200","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if he will provide the necessary funding to an organisation (details supplied) to source a premises suitable for its needs in Galway city; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1690,"content":"<p>Funding of the nature described by the Deputy is not available within my Department's youth service's budget.

The Industrial Relations Act 1946 sets out the process for adopting an ERO.  <\/p><p>I acknowledge the independent nature of the Labour Court and Joint Labour Committee (JLC) process and the hard work of its members to negotiate pay and conditions for employees in the early learning and childcare sector. <\/p><p>I understand that two draft EROs on a number of grades within the Early Years sector have been published by the JLC for the purpose of public consultation. In both cases the consultation processes have now ended, and the JLC is considering the submissions it received during the consultation processes.<\/p><p>Any ERO that comes into force will set minimum rates of pay for the relevant roles within the sector, and it will be open to employers to pay higher rates of pay than the minimums.<\/p><p>The new Core Funding stream I announced in the Budget to begin in September 2022 is designed to support a range of objectives, including the drawing up of EROs to determine minimum rates of pay for workers, as well as supporting career pathways and graduate employment.<\/p><p>Of the &euro;221 million Core Funding budget, approximately two thirds is intended to contribute to improved pay rates across different categories of staff. This portion of the budget cannot be made available without assurances that this funding will be channelled towards achieving this intended objective.  <\/p><p>Accordingly, a pre-condition of the Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement is that Core Funding will only come into effect and is contingent upon EROs being in effect to cover all roles across the sector as defined in the Early Years&rsquo; Service Joint Labour Committee Establishment Order.<\/p><p>In the event that there are no EROs, or an ERO that only covers one role in the sector in effect on 1st September 2022, Core Funding cannot proceed. <\/p><p>Officials in my Department are working with Pobal on the development of an alternative funding arrangement for the sector in the regrettable event that EROs are not in effect in time for the introduction of Core Funding in September.<\/p><p>Without the EROs in place in time, the alternative funding scheme cannot make available the intended funding contribution towards staff costs. Provision will be made to ensure that services do not experience a reduction in income compared to that which they received in higher capitation and programme support payments last year and remain sustainable but the alternative funding scheme will mean that the quantum of funding available to most services will amount to approximately one third of the value that they would receive through Core Funding.  <\/p><p>I am fully supportive of improved pay and conditions for this valued workforce and achieved significant investment from Government in Budget 2022 for this purpose. I urge the JLC to continue its negotiations to agree EROs for all grades in the sector, including minimum rates for graduate Lead Educators and graduate Managers. I am hopeful that EROs can be agreed swiftly and that Core Funding can go ahead underpinned by the EROs in September.  <b><\/b><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Childcare Services","counter":1694,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1695,"qnumday":607,"qnumall":"[39496\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400093#WREE01800","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"if his attention has been drawn to local creches and after-school childcare facilities cancelling childcare spaces due to staff shortages as a result of Covid and the cost-of-living crisis; the efforts that his Department is taking to review the situation and to assist families in need of a childcare place; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1627","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1696,"content":"<p>Services must inform the Department if they close the entire service and they may be given Force Majeure permission to close if the closure is outside of their control, such as power cuts or extreme weather.My Department can, at its discretion, continue to provide funding to services which have closed on Force Majeure grounds.<\/p><p>If a service reduces its hours, and is contracted to provide any of the Department funding schemes, ECCE, NCS or CCSP, they are required in their funding agreements to notify parents and amend their service calendar at least 4 weeks in advance of the change of hours.  <\/p><p>If a service has not done so, the parents should, in the first instance, contact their local County Childcare Committee who can escalate the case to the Department if necessary.The CCCs are funded by the Department and act as the Department&rsquo;s local agents in each county.<\/p><p>If a service reduces it hours without reducing parental fees<b>,<\/b>they would be considered to be in breach of Transition Funding, which requires providers not to increase their fees over the amount charged in September 2021.

It is promoted by Wind Energy Ireland (WEI), the representative body for the Irish wind industry, working to promote wind energy as an essential, economical and environmentally friendly part of the country&rsquo;s low-carbon energy future. A number of renewable energy programmes are funded under HCI and Springboard+, among other Green Skills courses. This includes: a Graduate Diploma in Sustainable Energy Systems at DCU; a Postgraduate Diploma in Wind Energy at Dundalk Institute of Technology; Certificate in Energy Sustainability at South East Technological University; and MEng in Energy Infrastructure at Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest.<\/p><p>Sustainable green skills are embedded in the Further Education and Training Strategy, which provides that climate change and sustainable development are key components of Further Education and Training (FET) processes.

A &lsquo;Green Cert&rsquo; training course refers to a list of land-based courses, which provides qualifications in Horticulture; Agriculture; Forestry or Equine<b><\/b>Studies. Upon completion of the Green Cert training course, a qualified person will meet the requirements of a qualified farmer for the purposes of all Revenue and Department of Agriculture (DAFM) schemes. In 2021, there were 600 Learner Enrolments registered on ETB Green Cert training courses. <\/p><p>In May 2021, an agreement was reached on a pilot project to be launched this year between the Campus des m&eacute;tiers et des qualifications d&rsquo;excellence international normand des &eacute;nergies (CEINE), Dublin &amp;amp; Dun Laoghaire ETB, Kerry ETB, Laois Offaly ETB, Limerick &amp;amp; Clare ETB and Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan ETB. These organisations will seek to build on their shared expertise in the field of Green Technologies Skills. ETB Further Education &amp;amp; Training will have a primary role in ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s workforce has the required skills to meet its ambitious energy targets. LOETB has attended two meetings on the pilot for Green Technology Skills CEINE to date. The most recent meeting took place in October 2021 and it was agreed that the initial focus of the Programme would be on offshore wind turbine maintenance in conjunction with Kerry ETB. Other programmes of interest to LOETB, which were referenced at the meeting as potential &quot;start points&quot; of French-Irish cooperation include: Digital Technologies; Sustainable Agriculture and the transition from Peat to Renewable Energy, to name but a few.<\/p><p>The Wind Turbine Maintenance Technician (WTMT) Apprenticeship was launched in March 2022. Kerry ETB is the coordinating provider for the apprenticeship. It is estimated that there will be in the region of 18 registrations by year end.  It will run for a duration of 3 years and is offered at Level 6 on the NFQ. The rationale for this apprenticeship is that there is no current apprenticeship which provides the range of knowledge, skills and competencies needed for the role of wind turbine maintenance technician. This Apprenticeship is for people who wish to pursue a career in the maintenance of large scale commercial wind turbines. It is designed to meet the needs of the growing Irish Renewable and Sustainable Energy sector. This apprenticeship will create a pathway into this career for school leavers or those who do not currently possess any relevant qualifications.<\/p><p>Kerry ETB recognised the shortage of training and education opportunities in this area, and in consultation with a number of employers implemented the highly successful wind turbine maintenance traineeship. This traineeship typically lasts 39 weeks and includes a minimum of 30 percent on-the-job training. Upon completion, trainees may receive a City and Guilds Level 3 NVQ Diploma in Electrical Power Engineering. This has been run in Kerry ETB&rsquo;s training facility since 2014 with very high placement rates for trainees involved.

CoFPI engaged in extensive consultations as part of the deliberations that informed its report and recommendations including with Garda members and Garda staff and with their representative bodies.<\/p>  <p>  A central tenet of the CoFPI report is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be a single organisation with a single workforce. <\/p>  <p>  It found that more integrated workforce structures were required to leverage the different skills and perspectives of Garda members and Garda staff and thereby contribute to enhancing the capacity of the organisation to deliver better policing outcomes for communities throughout the country.

This is a key commitment in my Justice Plan 2022.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to enact a Family Court Bill to create a new dedicated Family Court within the existing court structure and provide for court procedures that support a faster and less adversarial resolution of disputes. In September 2020, Government approved the drafting of a Family Court Bill along the lines of the General Scheme, which has been published. The General Scheme of the Family Court Bill has been referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and drafting is progressing with a view to publication of the Bill as soon as possible in 2022.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  I also established a Family Justice Oversight Group to develop the first national strategy for the reform of the family justice system and to support the legislative changes proposed in the planned Family Court Bill. The focus of the Group is to drive and coordinate the modernisation of the family justice system to make it more user-friendly, streamlined, supportive and, where possible, less adversarial.\u00a0 The terms of reference of the Group include developing a high-level vision and medium and long-term objectives for the development of an effective national family justice system; this will be most obvious in the development of the first Family Justice Strategy and its subsequent implementation. The Strategy is currently being finalised.<\/p>  <p>  As part of its work to develop the Strategy the Group engaged in a consultation process where relevant stakeholders, the public, children and young people who engage with the family justice system gave their views on how a modernised family justice system should look. \u00a0A number of common issues were raised and are being considered for inclusion in the emergent Family Justice Strategy, including: a greater focus on children; the availability of and access to support services; the potential use of less adversarial approaches to the resolution of disputes, where possible and appropriate; training; information dissemination and awareness raising.<\/p>  <p>  One of the areas being considered by the Group is additional training for those working within the family justice system that would benefit all those who engage with the system. The Family Court Bill will provide that specialist knowledge and ongoing professional training in the area of family law will be required to be appointed as a Family Court judge.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  To bring a strategic focus to the question of judicial numbers, I have established the Judicial Planning Working Group to consider the number and type of judges required over the next five years. The Group is expected to report in the Autumn following consideration of an independent review of judicial numbers which is being carried out by the OECD. This review will be benchmarked against international comparisons.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to investing over &euro;270m every year for the next five years in capital projects in the Justice Sector as part of the National Development Plan (NDP) 2021-2030, which represents a significant increase on recent years. This investment will provide for the completion of vital projects including a new family law complex at Hammond Lane. It will also be used to help fund building and refurbishment projects across the Justice sector, including in court buildings. This will be key in helping us achieve our aim of building a justice system that works for everyone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Data Protection","counter":1810,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG01800"},{"type":"question","counter":1811,"qnumday":649,"qnumall":"[38887\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG01900","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if the regulation under the Data Protection Act 2018 to facilitate the transfer of information to Operation Denton has been finalised.","asker":"1466","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1812,"content":"<p>I can confirm for the Deputy that I signed the Data Protection Act 1988 (Section 2B) Regulations 2022 on Tuesday 12 July.\u00a0The legal mechanism is therefore now in place for\u00a0An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to cooperate with Operation Denton.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pathology Service","counter":1813,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1814,"qnumday":650,"qnumall":"[38918\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400095#WRGG02200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"her plans to provide improved facilities available to the State Pathologist; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1588","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1815,"content":"<p>As the Deputy may be aware, the Office of the State Pathologist (OSP) is located together with the Dublin District Coroner on the site of the former Garda Station in Whitehall in Dublin.

Ireland is generally regarded as a safe country in international terms, with relatively low crime rates and a general feeling of safety and security. However, we recognise that this is not the case in every community and that people living in disadvantaged areas can experience a different reality. <\/p>  <p>  The Report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recognised that preventing crime and harm and making our communities safer does not rest with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department alone, but requires a whole of Government approach. Therefore, community safety goes beyond traditional high-visibility policing and must involve collaboration between service providers to find solutions to safety issues.<\/p>  <p>  A community safety approach prioritises issues identified by the community itself as safety concerns and increases community confidence in service providers.<\/p>  <p>  My Department's Community Safety Policy, which is published on the Gov.ie website, will ensure communities are safer and feel safer by making community safety a whole of Government responsibility and priority, to be delivered through Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSPs), supported through a national governance structure. <\/p>  <p>  The LCSPs will bring all services and the community together at local authority level, building upon and replacing existing Joint Policing Committees, to serve as a forum for discussion and decisions on community priorities. This means State services working with each other and the community to ensure there is better coordination between services such as educational and youth work with young people, the availability of local health and mental health services, drug prevention, housing and the built environment, and actions taken to combat alcohol and substance abuse, domestic abuse, youth crime, anti-social behaviour, and hate crime.<\/p>  <p>  The partnership approach is built on two premises:<\/p>  <p>  1. Every community is different and has different problems and issues; and<\/p>  <p>  2. Responding to those problems and issues requires a range of inputs from across  Government, local services, voluntary sector and the community itself.<\/p>  <p>  Three pilot LCSPs have been fully established in Dublin North Inner City, Longford and Waterford. The pilots will run for two years, concluding in Q3 2023, and will be subject to a strict evaluation so that lessons learned and best practice from the pilot phase can inform the further roll out of the LCSP model to all local authority areas after the enactment of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. <\/p>  <p>  Each pilot LCSP is currently engaged in developing the first iteration of their Local Community Safety Plans and I look forward to seeing their progress in the months ahead.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400096#WRHH01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1502"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":1862,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400096#WRHH01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1863,"qnumday":667,"qnumall":"[39256\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400096#WRHH01800","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of unmarked garda motorcycles in the fleet as of 31 December 2020 and 8 July 2022, in tabular form","asker":"1489","askee":"1502"},{"type":"speech","counter":1864,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended), the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the purchase, allocation, and effective and efficient use of Garda vehicles.

The NSAC has commissioned HIQA to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) looking at the addition of other SCID types to the NBS programme. This HTA is underway and I am looking forward to receiving a recommendation from the Committee on this condition after the HTA process is finalised later this year.<\/p>  <p>  The NSAC is now well established and recently published its second annual report which detailed significant progress in 2021. The Committee's first Annual Call for proposals for new screening programmes or changes to our existing programmes, received a significant response with a total of 53 submissions received, including on newborn screening. Submissions were received from various sources and are now undergoing consideration by the committee. The NSAC intends to publish its full work programme later this year once it has considered all proposals submitted.<\/p>  <p>  Given that this is a complex area, careful consideration must be given to the expansion of the NBS programme and these things can take time, however, it is important that decisions are made based on internationally accepted criteria and scientific rigour.  <\/p>  <p>  I am aware of how difficult it is for parents whose children have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them, their families and their children. It can be an overwhelming situation and can be very isolating for many families because of the significant work that is involved when a rare disease is diagnosed. I am committed to the further expansion of newborn screening in Ireland and in identifying opportunities for future additions to it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products","counter":2002,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK02900"},{"type":"question","counter":2003,"qnumday":713,"qnumall":"[39036\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK03000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when children between six and 11 years of age will be given access to a drug for cystic fibrosis (details supplied); the reason for the delay in doing this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2004,"content":"<p>Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for the administration of the community drug schemes; therefore, the matter has been referred to the HSE for attention and direct reply to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Service Executive","counter":2005,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":2006,"qnumday":714,"qnumall":"[39048\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400098#WRKK03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question Nos. 1446, 1447 and 1448 of 14 June 2022, if he will follow up with the HSE as to the reason that detailed responses were not issued; if he will seek an explanation as to the reason that detailed replies did not issue in relation to these questions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1575","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":2007,"content":"<p>In relation to the Parliamentary Questions the Deputy refers to, I have been advised by the HSE that answers to the PQs referred to the HSE were sent to the Deputy on 10th June 2022 addressing the issues raised. <\/p><p>This information provided in response to the three PQs is included below for ease of reference.<\/p><p>The Government is committed to addressing the long-standing deficit in critical care capacity.

While significant work continues to positively impact on waiting times and improve pathways to elective care, acute hospitals have been impacted by operational challenges arising from surges in cases related to the Omicron variants. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling. To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically-aligned and prioritised way, hospitals are following HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. <\/p>  <p>  The Department of Health continues to work with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to identify ways to improve access to care, including through increased use of private hospitals, funding weekend and evening work in public hospitals, funding &ldquo;see and treat&rdquo; services, providing virtual clinics, and increasing capacity in the public hospital system. <\/p>  <p>  The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan, which was launched on the 25th of February, allocates &euro;350 million to the HSE and NTPF to reduce waiting lists. Under this plan the Department, HSE, and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity for the treatment of patients, as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  This is the first stage of an ambitious multi-annual waiting list programme, which is currently under development in the Department of Health. Between them, these plans will work to support short, medium, and long term initiatives to reduce waiting times and provide the activity needed in years to come.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) has provided the attached table which outlines the waiting lists for upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy by area of residence for Cavan &amp;amp; Monaghan, in standardised time bands of 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 12-18 months and 18+months. The NTPF publishes waiting list data in standardised time-bands and Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) techniques are applied to the data to preserve confidentiality and mitigate against identification or self-identification of individuals.<\/p>  <p>data.oireachtas.ie\/ie\/oireachtas\/debates\/questions\/supportingDocumentation\/2022-07-14_pq739-14-7-22_en.xlsx<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400099#WRLL04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":2079,"content":"<p>Question No. 739 answered with Question No. 738.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Staff","counter":2080,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400099#WRLL04400"},{"type":"question","counter":2081,"qnumday":740,"qnumall":"[39099\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022071400099#WRLL04500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide a breakdown of the number of vacancies at Cavan General Hospital;

Consideration is being given as to what the best model for this evaluation will be.<\/p>  <p>  I recognise how difficult it has been for the families of nursing home residents who died during this pandemic, which has presented one of the greatest and most wide-ranging public health challenges internationally in recent history. Throughout the pandemic, the overall national response to COVID-19 has had a specific and sustained focus on older persons, particularly those resident in nursing homes.<\/p>  <p>  This included the establishment of a structured nursing home support system, in line with National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) recommendations, to provide enhanced supports to public and private nursing homes. A comprehensive package of direct and indirect supports was established in early 2020 and many of these remain active across the country to support nursing homes on a proactive basis.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the independent COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel was established early in the pandemic in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of COVID-19 in nursing homes and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing response. The Expert Panel report outlines the key protective measures that we must ensure are in place across our nursing homes, based on learning from our own and the international experience of COVID-19. Work to progress the recommendations of the Expert Panel report, particularly those recommendations requiring a priority focus in the response to COVID-19, is ongoing across all of the health agencies and stakeholders.

It is proposed that a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use will directly follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on the Future of Education, if learnings from the concurrent running of assemblies suggest that this operational model is the best way forward.<\/p>  <p>  In line with this decision, the Department of Health has commenced preparations for the Citizens&rsquo; Assembly on Drug Use, and, to this end, detailed discussions regarding the assembly took place at the most recent meeting of the National Oversight Committee for the National Drugs Strategy. These preparations are being undertaken to ensure that there will be no delay in establishing this citizens&rsquo; assembly when the two assemblies which are currently operating complete their work before the end of this year or in quarter 1, 2023 at the latest. This will allow a period of over one year for the Government to consider its recommendations.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is pursuing a health-led approach to drug use through the health diversion programme, which offers compassion, not punishment to people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. The programme will connect participants with health services and provide a pathway to recovery. It will also allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences, particularly for younger people.<\/p>  <p>  As we prepare for the Citizens Assembly on Drug Use, work continues to implement the health diversion programme and the strategic priorities for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy. One of these priorities is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences. This priority aligns with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan, 2021 &ndash; 2025, which actively encourages Member States to scale up alternatives to coercive sanctions and to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness for drug using offenders and for people arrested, charged with or convicted for drug-related offences or people found in possession of drugs for personal use.<\/p>  <p>  I am very positive about the potential contribution of the citizens assembly to the government's health-led response to drug use.
