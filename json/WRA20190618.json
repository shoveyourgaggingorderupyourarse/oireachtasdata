I have visited Israel and Palestine three times over the last eighteen months, holding meetings with the key interlocutors in both places, including both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu. These visits and meetings have allowed me to raise Ireland's priorities with pivotal decision makers.<\/p>  <p>  At present, prospects for the resumption of negotiations centre on the peace plan being developed by the United States. I have engaged with the US Middle East team to encourage this initiative, and to highlight some of the key issues which it will have to address if it is to be successful in meeting the needs of both parties, and laying the foundations for a durable and sustainable peace. I have encouraged my EU colleagues to take a similar approach. The US administration has taken a series of unilateral actions over the past year that have made bringing all interlocutors together for negotiations more difficult. Efforts towards peace are more likely to succeed when attention is paid to creating the right political context for fruitful cooperation. I have conveyed this view to both US and Israeli interlocutors.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently taken action at both EU and UN levels to ensure that the international community retains a focus on the Israel-Palestine issue. Our attention is focused both on specific issues and events in Gaza and the West Bank, and the broader objective of a resolution of the conflict and an end to the Israeli occupation, something which is essential for the long term future of the Palestinian territory, and indeed also for Israel.<\/p>  <p>  At EU level, issues relating to the Israel-Palestine conflict are regularly discussed at both Ministerial and official level, [most recently in a discussion with the Jordanian Foreign Minister at yesterday&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Council.] <\/p>  <p>  The same issues are also discussed regularly at UN level, at the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council. In December 2018, Ireland proposed a Resolution at the UN General Assembly on a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. This resolution, which reaffirmed the long-standing and broadly agreed parameters for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, was adopted by an overwhelming majority of 156 UN states, including common EU support. At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March 2019, Ireland co-sponsored four draft resolutions pertaining to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which were adopted by vote.  <\/p>  <p>  I held a meeting in Dublin in February to discuss the Middle East Peace Process with a small group of EU and Arab Foreign Ministers, and the Secretary General of the Arab League. At this meeting we considered how the EU, together with the international community, can productively engage and better use all the levers at our disposal, to influence the parties to the conflict, including private messaging on events as they develop.<\/p>  <p>  I firmly believe that the best way forward would be the resumption of negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian parties, to allow both sides to meet their aspirations and resolve their differences, moving on from grievances to a just outcome which meets the needs of both peoples. However, the international community shares a responsibility to help to create a context for such negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  The situation in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory will remain high on my agenda and I am committed to do everything I can to make a positive contribution to support credible efforts to resume negotiations and to advance the Middle East Peace Process.<\/p>  <p>  I will continue to press for strong EU engagement notwithstanding other problems in the region; to encourage and seek to influence the US initiative; and to explore practical ideas to improve conditions on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Migration Crisis","counter":26,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01300"},{"type":"question","counter":27,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[25228\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions he has had or plans to have with his European counterparts with regard to the increased criminalisation of sea rescues of migrants in the Mediterranean; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1238","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":28,"qnumday":66,"qnumall":"[25102\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the UN Refugee Agency has indicated that the Mediterranean Sea will soon be a sea of blood due to a lack of NGO rescue ships and the conflict in Libya hastening departures at an alarming rate (details supplied); and if he will urgently speak to his European counterparts to review and reverse the policies of the EU before thousands more drown in the Mediterranean.","asker":"1309","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":29,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 66 together.<\/p>  <p>  I am very concerned about the situation in the Mediterranean. Tackling the scourge of people trafficking and saving lives at sea is a priority for Ireland and we have been active in operations to tackle people-trafficking in the Mediterranean since 2015, first through Operation Pontus, a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Italy. Since 2017 Ireland has been a full member of Operation Sophia. Since 2015, Irish naval vessels have rescued thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean.<\/p>  <p>  At the March 2019 Foreign Affairs Council meeting called for a continuation of the full mandate of Operation Sophia to allow time for the outstanding issues around disembarkation to be addressed without disrupting the critical work of the Mission and its humanitarian aspects. Unfortunately, to my disappointment, it was not possible to get full agreement for this, but we did ensure that the Operation will continue and that its mandate will remain under review so as to be able to respond to any changing circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  The Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) meeting this month addressed the challenges the EU is facing on migration and asylum and reiterated the importance of making greater progress on European-wide solutions.

This decision was taken as a gesture of solidarity and humanitarian assistance. France, Germany, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania and Slovenia also all agreed to take a number of these rescued migrants.<\/p>  <p>  Addressing  the migration crisis will ultimately require deeper political, economic and development relationships between the EU and neighbouring countries, including many in Africa, that will form a basis for dealing with a variety of challenges on the basis of shared responsibility.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Conflicts","counter":30,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":31,"qnumday":50,"qnumall":"[25170\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800060#WRC01800","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the continued violence and humanitarian crisis in Yemen; the steps Ireland is taking at EU level to address the unethical sales of EU arms which has furthered the conflict; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1291","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":32,"content":"<p>Four years of conflict in Yemen has caused the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis, with almost 80% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU fully support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths to bring about a negotiated solution.

This assessment shows that all Brexit scenarios will imply a slower pace of growth with negative consequences throughout the economy. <\/p>  <p>  The lower growth outlook would have implications for the labour market and Government finances. The negative impacts will be most keenly felt in those sectors with strong export ties to the UK market along with their suppliers.

Those estimates suggested that Irish exports would be reduced by 4.6% in a deal scenario and 8.3% in a disorderly no deal scenario after ten years. Imports would be reduced by 4.5% in a deal scenario and 8.2% in a disorderly no deal scenario after ten years.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 25% of the population, approximately 7 million people, are in need of humanitarian assistance. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully supportive of the UN-coordinated response mechanism for humanitarian aid in the country, and of the &euro;117 million in EU funding since 2018 for humanitarian assistance.

I have stated clearly on a number of occasions that the Iran nuclear agreement was a significant diplomatic achievement, that it was delivering as intended, and that, as verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran had implemented its commitments under the agreement. Ireland's views on this have been clearly conveyed to the US Government on a number of occasions. We do share the US's concerns about Iran's activities in the region, including its ballistic missile programme, and poor human rights record, but believe that none of these issues can be better addressed without the JCPOA in place. <\/p>  <p>  While EU and UN sanctions were not reimposed following the US decision last year, US sanctions have deterred some EU trade with Iran. However, other EU partners have been more exposed than Ireland in this regard, as two of the most important sectors for Ireland, foodstuffs and pharmaceuticals\/medical equipment, were never subject to sanctions. The fact that US financial sanctions had remained in place, even after the signing of the nuclear agreement, has meant that Irish banks have continued to be very cautious in handling payments originating in Iran. This had already been a significant factor inhibiting significant growth in trade with Iran. However, bilateral trade has increased since the implementation of the nuclear deal. <\/p>  <p>  The E-3 group (France, Germany and the UK) have established INSTEX, a special purpose vehicle designed to insulate financial transactions with Iran from the US financial system and US sanctions. Ireland fully supports the establishment of INSTEX, and while it is not yet in operation, I am hopeful that it will be able to deliver as intended. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU will continue to endeavour to ensure the effective implementation of the JCPOA and adherence to its commitments by all remaining parties. Ireland believes that there is no credible peaceful alternative to the JCPOA. <\/p>  <p>   While Iran's frustration with the impact on their economy of the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement is understandable, I nevertheless deeply regret comments made by Iran last month indicating that it may not continue to adhere to the JCPOA. Ireland's and the EU's view is that all parties to the agreement should continue to implement their commitments.

In international forums, Ireland consistently advocates for adherence to the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence, and calls on all parties &ndash; for example, those engaged in the Syria conflict &ndash; to fulfil their responsibility to protect civilians and to allow the safe passage of humanitarian assistance.  <\/p>  <p>  Promoting international peace and security in regions of conflict is a core mission of the United Nations.

This commitment informs Ireland&rsquo;s decision to seek election to a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for the period 2021-22.

The Transitional Military Council announced its intention to govern for a two-year period after which there would be Presidential elections: in the meantime, Sudan's Constitution was suspended, Parliament dissolved, and a three-month state of emergency was declared.<\/p>  <p>  Demonstrators, while welcoming the removal of President al-Bashir, continued to demand a civilian-led Government.  On 15 May, following extensive negotiations, an agreement in principle was announced for a three-year transition period. However, final agreement regarding a civilian majority on a proposed 11-member Supreme Council was opposed by the Transitional Military Council, and negotiations stalled.   <\/p>  <p>  Shortly after dawn on 3 June, heavily armed security forces surrounded demonstrators and shot indiscriminately with live bullets and teargas resulting in significant loss of life. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), formed from the remnants of the Janjaweed militia and accused of committing war crimes in Darfur, with elements from police and national intelligence are believed to be responsible for these attacks. <\/p>  <p>  The same day, the TMC announced that it was cancelling all agreements with the opposition and that elections would be held within nine months. Demonstrators demand a longer period to guarantee fair elections.<\/p>  <p>  That evening, EU High Representative Mogherini issued a statement declaring that there can be no justification for the use of force to disperse peaceful protests, and that the Transitional Military Council is accountable for security and rule of law in the country. I also issued a statement strongly condemning the use of violence and excessive force against protestors.   It is imperative that all violations against protestors, including widespread reports of sexual and gender-based violence, are independently investigated and the perpetrators held accountable.<\/p>  <p>  On 6 June, the African Union decided with immediate effect to suspend Sudan from participation in all African Union activities until the effective establishment of a civilian-led transitional authority.  This followed sustained, but ultimately unsuccessful, engagement with the Transitional Military Council to encourage them to restore constitutional order. The African Union has demonstrated robust and principled leadership in responding to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  On Tuesday 11 June, the UN Security Council unanimously condemned the violence in Sudan and called on the Transitional Military Council and the opposition to work towards a solution to the crisis. The Council called for an immediate end to the violence against civilians and emphasised the importance of upholding human rights.<\/p>  <p>  The EU Foreign Affairs Council met on 17 June and Ministers discussed how the EU can support the establishment of a credible political process in Sudan that will facilitate a peaceful transition to civilian-led transitional Government. An EU-28 statement issued following the meeting, which strongly condemned the recent violence against protestors including sexual and gender-based violence. It also expressed EU support for the African Union which has taken a principled and robust stance to the crisis.<\/p>  <p>  My officials continue to actively monitor developments in Sudan, through the Embassy of Ireland in Nairobi, and through the European Union delegation in Khartoum. Senior officials from my Department also met with the Sudanese Ambassador to Ireland earlier this year to discuss the situation.

From the outset, I have highlighted the risks which Brexit poses for Northern Ireland and for the Good Friday Agreement. I have repeatedly stated that a no deal Brexit is in no one&rsquo;s interests, least of all for the people of Northern Ireland. Over the course of the last several months, I have discussed our concerns with the UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt; Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley; and David Lidington, the UK Minister of the Cabinet Office. I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to raise these issues in my contacts with all relevant interlocutors in Britain, Northern Ireland, and at EU level.<\/p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly convinced that the Withdrawal Agreement remains the only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal, in a manner that protects the Single Market and the hard-won gains of the Good Friday Agreement.

Together with our partners in the EU, we will continue to insist that the issue of the border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement will need to be resolved as a condition for opening wider negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of a no deal scenario, we will continue to work with the Commission on the shared twin objectives of protecting the integrity of the single market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it, and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly committed to our EU membership, and to the Single Market, which remains central to the success of our open, competitive economy and has been the foundation for much of the economic and social progress we have made in recent decades.

Officials from my Department both at home and abroad have been actively presenting Ireland&rsquo;s case and seeking support among the other 192 UN Member States. This has provided Ireland with an invaluable opportunity to build relationships and contacts across the world, which will stand to us long after the campaign has ended. <\/p>  <p>  In October we obtained observer status at the Organisation of the Francophonie &ndash; an important step in increasing our engagement with the French speaking world. <\/p>  <p>  More recently I launched a new strategy for the US and Canada and a White Paper on International Development Policy.

Targeted overtime has been sanctioned for both permanent and temporary staff when required. The Passport Service has received approval to recruit over 230 Temporary Clerical Officers (TCOs) in 2019 to assist in processing passport applications and to deal with the queries from the general public. A dedicated Customer Service Hub has been established to deal with queries from the public and additional staff have been allocated.<\/p>  <p>  The Passport Reform Programme continues to deliver major upgrades to the Passport Service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements.

The second phase of the Online Passport Renewal Service was rolled out in November 2018. The online facility now allows for the renewal of children's passports and has expanded the cohort of adults eligible to renew online. The online service brings significant benefits to citizens with faster turnaround times and greater customer satisfaction. The online service has been instrumental in the management of overall passport operations and in allowing the Passport Service to allocate staff resources more efficiently to cope with unprecedented demand. Other projects that will advance in 2019 include the development of business process automation, document management systems and the roll out of mailing machines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":108,"content":"<p>Question No. 78 answered with Question No. 67.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":109,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD03800"},{"type":"question","counter":110,"qnumday":79,"qnumall":"[25189\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD03900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if the Russian missile system being located in Turkey was discussed at the most recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting; and his views on same.","asker":"1283","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":111,"content":"<p>The Foreign Affairs Council met in Luxembourg yesterday (17 June) and the decision by Turkey to purchase a Russian anti-aircraft missile system was not on the agenda.<\/p><p>It is not our normal practice to comment on the defence procurement policies of third countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Negotiations","counter":112,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD04100"},{"type":"question","counter":113,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[25209\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800061#WRD04200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the discussions he has had with his EU counterparts with regard to extending the Brexit deadline beyond 31 October 2019.","asker":"1294","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":114,"content":"<p>Throughout the Article 50 process, I, as well as officials from my Department, have had frequent and ongoing contact with representatives from other EU27 Member States and the Commission.

This scenario would also have the gravest consequences for cross border trade which is so significant to the Northern Ireland economy and thus for the all-island economy, the protection of which is a major priority for this Government.<\/p>  <p>  This latest report&rsquo;s findings are sobering and very much in line with other such reports and indeed with the letter from the Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service to political parties there in April. Despite the considerable amount of mitigation work that has been undertaken to date across Departments in Northern Ireland, there are considerable and unavoidable risks to the local economy that cannot be mitigated. The report makes clear that there is limited room for manoeuvre for businesses and government in a no deal context. <\/p>  <p>  I have repeatedly discussed my concerns around the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland with my British counterparts. I maintain frequent contact with UK Ministers. Over the course of the last several months, I have met with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt; Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley; and David Lidington, the UK Minister of the Cabinet Office. <\/p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the imperative of avoiding a no deal scenario will continue to inform the Government&rsquo;s approach. From the outset, I have highlighted the risks which Brexit poses for Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. I have repeatedly stated that a no deal Brexit is in no one&rsquo;s interests, least of all for the people of Northern Ireland who will be most affected. <\/p>  <p>  The Government remains firmly convinced that the Withdrawal Agreement remains the only way to ensure an orderly UK withdrawal, in a manner that protects the Single Market and the hard-won gains of the Good Friday Agreement. The backstop is the only viable solution on the table that avoids physical infrastructure and related checks and controls, preserves the all-island economy and fully protects the Good Friday Agreement, as well the integrity of the EU Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it. <\/p>  <p>  There should be no illusions in the UK that a change in political circumstances will convince the EU to make changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, including the backstop. It cannot be opened or renegotiated. The European Council has made this consistently clear. <\/p>  <p>  It is now more important than ever that all sides in the UK assume their responsibilities and ratify the Withdrawal Agreement, which provides much-needed legal certainty. <\/p>  <p>  Let me be clear, however, that the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process does not disappear in a no deal scenario. We and the EU will insist that the issue of the border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement will need to be resolved as a condition for opening wider negotiations on the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  In the case of a no deal scenario, we will continue to work with the Commission on the shared twin objectives of protecting the integrity of the single market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it, and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800062#WRE05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"European Council Meetings","counter":164,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800062#WRE05400"},{"type":"question","counter":165,"qnumday":101,"qnumall":"[25598\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800062#WRE05500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he spoke with his EU counterparts prior to the June European Council meeting regarding the need for an extension of the 31 October 2019 deadline for Brexit.","asker":"1224","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":166,"content":"<p>The European Council on 10 April agreed to extend that Article 50 process to 31 October, providing the UK with more time to ensure an orderly withdrawal.

The seabed beneath the EEZ is the continental shelf.  <\/p>  <p>  Largely due to efforts made by Ireland throughout the 1970s, international law is now clear that uninhabitable rocks such as Rockall have no entitlement to a continental shelf or an EEZ and so sovereignty over such a rock is irrelevant for the purposes of establishing boundaries between continental shelves and EEZs of neighbouring States.  Sovereignty, and whether such a rock has a 12-mile territorial sea, are separate issues that do not arise in establishing boundaries between continental shelves and EEZs.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of Rockall therefore did not arise in the 2013 Agreement as it was not relevant.  <\/p>  <p>  The 2013 Agreement built on the 1988 Agreement between Ireland and the UK that had already established continental shelf boundaries and provides that those boundaries, slightly adjusted to ensure that no waters were lost to the high seas, shall also be the EEZ boundaries.

The 2013 Agreement between Ireland and the UK is not relevant for access by EU vessels to UK waters in that context. <\/p>  <p>  The main purpose of the 2013 Agreement was to resolve jurisdictional uncertainty.  It addressed the situation of fishing vessels seeking to avoid inspection in Irish EEZ areas that overlapped with the UK-claimed areas.

The Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland which was agreed as part of the Withdrawal Agreement underpins, in a dynamic way, continuing North-South cooperation and the all-island economy as well as recognising the Common Travel Area. <\/p>  <p>  On 8 May the Irish and British governments entered into a Memorandum of Understanding reaffirming our joint commitment to the Common Travel Area, and to maintaining this longstanding reciprocal arrangement under which Irish and British citizens can live, work, study, and access healthcare, social security and public services in each other&rsquo;s jurisdictions. <\/p>  <p>  In general, managing a no deal Brexit would be an exercise in damage limitation, and without a Withdrawal Agreement, avoiding a hard border would become more complex and challenging.

On 11 April, it was announced that President Omar al-Bashir had been removed from power and that a Transitional Military Council (TMC) had assumed control in Sudan. Negotiations between the TMC and protesters have stalled, with security forces carrying out violent attacks against protestors, resulting in significant loss of life. <\/p>  <p>  These dynamics are accompanied by a continued competition from countries including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Turkey, for influence and control in the Horn, particularly Somalia and Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  The region is also affected by the challenges of irregular migration, forced displacement, trafficking in human beings, and smuggling of people.

The EU engages in the region through political dialogue, its Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions (EU NAVFOR Operation Atalanta, EUCAP Somalia, and EUTM Somalia), and development and humanitarian cooperation. The former Director of the Irish Coast Guard deployed to Mogadishu to take up the position of Deputy Head of Mission at EUCAP Somalia in January.  Ireland, through the EU, also supports the efforts of the UN peacekeeping mission AMISOM to stabilise Somalia. Through regional and bilateral programmes and the Trust Fund for Africa, the EU is providing over &euro;3 billion to the Horn of Africa (2014-2020) which focuses on supporting economic opportunities for young people.  Ireland has pledged &euro;15 million to the Trust Fund for Africa.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland supports regional efforts in the Horn of Africa to achieve stability, normalise relations and increase regional cooperation, including through regional organisations such as the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). During his visit to Ethiopia in January 2019, the Taoiseach met with the acting Chairperson of the African Union to discuss regional issues.<\/p>  <p>  During his visit to Ethiopia and Kenya in November 2017, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD and the African Union, and Ireland has since provided funding to IGAD to support negotiation, monitoring and evaluation of the South Sudan peace agreement and is planning to further increase engagement with the African Union in 2019. In addition, two Departmental officials are seconded to the EU mission in South Sudan, including one as Head of Mission.<\/p>  <p>  The EU has a Special Representative to the Horn of Africa, Alex Rondos, whose mandate is to contribute to regional and international efforts to achieve lasting peace, security and development in the region.

Neither I, nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the price or the level of cover to be provided to consumers or businesses.  <\/p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that I, as Minister for Finance, cannot comment on individual cases. The primary reason for this is that I  do not have full information on such cases. For instance, I do not know whether there are  claims outstanding or other issues relevant  to the pricing of cover of this type, such as claims levels within the sector as a whole.  These are factors which will impact upon the availability and pricing of such insurance cover.<\/p><p>However, I acknowledge the general problems faced by many small businesses and voluntary\/community associations in relation to the cost and availability of insurance as well as the frustrations that some may have with the pace of reform.  Unfortunately, there is no single policy or legislative &ldquo;silver bullet&rdquo; to immediately stem or reverse premium price rises.  This is because there are many constraints faced by the Government in trying to address this issue in particular the fact that  for constitutional reasons, it cannot direct the courts as to the award levels that should be applied and for legal reasons it cannot direct insurance companies as to the pricing level which they should apply in respect of businesses seeking insurance. <\/p><p>Notwithstanding this, I wish to re-emphasise how important this issue is for the Government. Consequently, following the publication of its Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance in 2017, the Cost of Insurance Working Group undertook an examination of the employer liability and public liability insurance sectors.  This second phase culminated in the publication in January 2018 of the <i>Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance<\/i>.  I believe there has been significant progress in the implementation of the two CIWG Reports. Examples include the following:<\/p><p>- the establishment of the Personal Injuries Commission, and its subsequent recommendations relating to addressing award levels for soft tissue injuries &ndash; this has provided the objective evidence we need to be able to address award levels;<\/p><p>- the establishment of the National Claims Information Database in the Central Bank to increase transparency around the future cost of private motor insurance; the Central Bank is currently reviewing the possibility of expanding is scope to cover business insurance;<\/p><p>- reforms to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board through the <i>Personal Injuries Assessment Board (Amendment) Act 2019<\/i>;<\/p><p>- amendments to Sections 8 and 14 of the <i>Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004<\/i>to make it easier for businesses and insurers to challenge cases where fraud or exaggeration is suspected;<\/p><p>- the reform of the Insurance Compensation Fund to provide certainty to policyholders and insurers; and,<\/p><p>- various reforms of how fraud is reported to and dealt with by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including increased co-ordination with the insurance industry, as well as the launch recently of <i>Operation Coatee<\/i>, a co-ordinated operation to tackle insurance fraud.<\/p><p>I believe that these reforms are having a significant impact with regard to private motor insurance (CSO figures from May 2019 show that the price of motor insurance is now 24.5% lower than the July 2016 peak).  The Government is determined to continue working to ensure that these positive pricing trends can be extended to other forms of insurance, including those relevant to businesses.<\/p><p>Undoubtedly the single most essential challenge which must be overcome if there is to be a sustainable reduction in insurance costs particularly for small businesses is to bring the levels of personal injury damages awarded in this country more in line with those awarded in other jurisdictions.  In this regard, the Personal Injuries Commission has highlighted the significant differential between award levels in Ireland and other jurisdictions, and has made a number of recommendations to address this issue, in particular the establishment of a Judicial Council to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injury.  Both I and Minister of State D&rsquo;Arcy believe that this awards gap needs to be significantly closed and we are working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Charlie Flanagan TD, to ensure that this happens at the earliest opportunity.  In this regard, work is progressing as a matter of priority on the Judicial Council Bill, and it is due to complete Report and Final Stages in the Seanad this week, prior to being submitted to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shortly thereafter.  I would hope that members of both Houses of the Oireachtas can collectively work together to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill is enacted by the summer.<\/p><p>Finally, I would like to assure the Deputy that the Cost of Insurance Working Group will continue to focus on implementing the recommendations of the Report on the Cost of Employer and Public Liability Insurance in parallel with implementing those from the Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance.  I am hopeful that the cumulative effects of the completion of the two Reports&rsquo; recommendations will include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for businesses and a more competitive insurance market.<\/p><p>Finally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance.

What this translates to in monetary terms will be determined by the resources required by the Bank to discharge its legal responsibilities during a given year. <\/p><p>In 2018, the cost of financial regulation activities was funded by levy income of &euro;129 million and subvention of &euro;66 million. <\/p><p>If industry was fully charged, there would be no subvention, however, there are certain costs (e.g. markets supervision) which it may be appropriate to continue to subvent on an ongoing basis where the costs cannot be attributed to specific firms but do relate to the orderly function of markets and the financial stability agenda.<\/p><p>In 2015, the Department of Finance and Central Bank of Ireland issued a joint public consultation on &lsquo;Funding the cost of Financial Regulation&rsquo; (CP95).  <\/p><p>In response to that consultation, my predecessor as Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, agreed to a phased movement towards 100 per cent Industry Funding in order to eliminate subvention, by the taxpayer, of regulatory costs. Since then, recovery rates have increased in stages across most industry sectors, determined on a yearly basis. Now, in order to give greater clarity to industry, I have approved the trajectory to bring the recovery rate of levies across sectors to 100 per cent over the coming years.  This change in policy will apply the user pays principle to the regulation of financial services. <\/p><p>The table below shows the planned trajectory for levy rates across all sectors. Credit Union recovery rates from 2022 onwards will be subject to review and a public consultation to guide strategy once 50% recovery rates have been achieved. The Central Bank published this trajectory on 14 June 2019 and it is available on the Central Bank website at the following link: <i><\/i><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Levy Year<\/th><th>2017<\/th><th>2018<\/th><th>2019<\/th><th>2020 <\/th><th>2021 <\/th><th>2022 <\/th><th>2023 <\/th><th>2024 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Levied in  <\/td><td>2017<\/td><td>2018<\/td><td>2020<\/td><td>2021<\/td><td>2022<\/td><td>2023<\/td><td>2024<\/td><td>2025<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>ELG Banks<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Banks<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Insurance Undertakings<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Investment Firms &amp;amp; Fund Service Providers<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Funds<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Retail Intermediaries &amp;amp; Debt Management Co&rsquo;s<\/td><td>50%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Moneylenders<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Approved Professional Bodies<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Bureau de Change\/Money Transmitters<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Retail Credit \/ Home Reversion \/ Credit Servicing Firms<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Payment &amp;amp; EMoney Institutions<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>65%<\/td><td>70%<\/td><td>75%<\/td><td>80%<\/td><td>90%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><td>100%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Invoices for 2019 levies will issue on an arrears basis in Quarter 3 2020 as the Central Bank implements its strategy to move from levies based on budgeted to lives based on actual costs.

Nonetheless, I would acknowledge that there are risks associated with this increase in corporation tax receipts. A fiscal vulnerability exists in the form of the exposure of the public finances to corporation tax receipts, which last year were at their highest ever share of Exchequer revenues at 18.7 percent of overall tax receipts. By way of context VAT and Income Tax receipts accounted for approximately 64 percent of our overall tax receipts. <\/p>  <p>  In recent years, I have taken steps to broaden our corporation tax base, including through the introduction of the 80 per cent cap on capital allowances for intangible assets in Budget 2018 and the introduction of a broader Exit Tax regime in Budget 2019. Measures have also been introduced which will ensure a continued broadening of the overall tax base. These include the introduction of the Universal Social Charge, the Local Property Tax and the sugar sweetened drinks tax. Further measures that I have taken which will enhance the tax base include the increase in the VAT rate for tourism related goods and services from the 9 per cent rate to the 13.5 per cent rate in Budget 2019. For 2019 all of these measures are projected to raise revenues equivalent to approximately 1.5 percent of GDP or 5.7 percent of overall general government revenue. <\/p>  <p>  Further steps which I have taken include an increase in the commercial (non-residential) Stamp Duty rate from 2 per cent to 6 per cent in Budget 2018 and an increase in the betting duty levy from 1 per cent to 2 percent in Budget 2019. I have also removed some tax reliefs, such as the Home Renovation Incentive and the Start your own Business Relief, and continued a roll-out of enhanced taxation compliance measures. However, I would note that further potential for base broadening exists, particularly in the environmental area where important policy priorities exist.<\/p>  <p>  The ongoing systematic review of tax expenditures, taken in line with my Department&rsquo;s Tax Expenditure Guidelines, will assist in this process through identifying deadweight, resource misallocation and assessing if tax reliefs still meet their initial policy objectives. This will also provide a &lsquo;health check&rsquo; as to whether they accord with the OECD tax hierarchy in terms of their impact upon economic growth.     <\/p>  <p>  My Department will shortly publish a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities to our tax revenues and to quantify where possible, the impact of a shock to corporation tax receipts. Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance. It is my intention to give consideration to these &ndash; and possibly other suggestions &ndash; with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Small and Medium Enterprises Supports","counter":273,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04400"},{"type":"question","counter":274,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[24931\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the actions he will take to stimulate the small and medium enterprise sector following the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1224","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":275,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (IFAC) has been assigned the monitoring and assessment functions required of an independent national fiscal institution under the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The Act requires IFAC to <i>&ldquo;provide an assessment of whether the fiscal stance for the year or years concerned is, conducive to prudent economic and budgetary management&rdquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>In addition, as part of the Council&rsquo;s so-called &lsquo;endorsement function IFAC provides an independent assessment of the official macroeconomic forecasts of the Department of Finance, upon which the Stability Programme Update (SPU) and Budgets are based. Accordingly, the Council&rsquo;s role is to assess the overall fiscal stance as well as the forecasts underpinning the SPU and Budget publications. Therefore, the impact of all government expenditure, is assessed by the Council in this context. <\/p><p>In respect of the actions that my Department will take to stimulate the small and medium sized enterprise sector, I would note that the Irish Fiscal Council Report that the Deputy refers to, which was published this month, does not explicitly address SMEs beyond the level of credit advanced to them. I note the trend of an increase in new credit advance to Irish SMEs over the past four years, as well as a general decrease in the level of indebtedness of Irish SMEs. This appears to be consistent with the findings of the Central Bank&rsquo;s SME Market Report for 2019.  <\/p><p>It is worth noting that demand for credit by SMEs has been consistently subdued in recent years according to a number of studies including the SME Credit Demand survey carried out by my Department.  This survey is conducted twice a year; over 1500 SMEs are surveyed to identify credit issues experienced by SMEs, the largest of its kind in the State. The latest Survey results, covering the period April &ndash; September 2018, has shown that demand for credit decreased to 20%, and of those SMEs that did not access credit 89% cited lack of credit requirements as their reasoning.<\/p><p>There are a number of policy supports and initiatives in place to support access to finance by Irish SMEs including the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland, the Local Enterprise Offices, the SME Online Tool, Microfinance Ireland and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI).<\/p><p>The SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s national promotional institution. The purpose of the SBCI is to deliver effective financial supports to Irish SMEs to address gaps and potential failures in the Irish SME finance market as well as encouraging competition and innovation, and facilitating the efficient and effective use of EU resources and financial instruments. The SBCI achieves this through the provision of low cost liquidity and risk-sharing guarantee activities that support the provision of appropriately priced, flexible funding to Irish SMEs. <\/p><p>Since it began its activities in March 2015, to the end of December 2018, the total amount of SBCI supported lending activity (through the provision of liquidity) was &euro;900 million to 21,783 Irish SMEs supporting 141,658 jobs. Under the SBCI&rsquo;s risk sharing schemes, &euro;152 million has been drawn down by 4,278 SMEs supporting 6,572 jobs. <\/p><p>Additionally, the Government launched the Brexit Loan Scheme in March of last year. This is a &euro;300 million loan scheme to provide short term working capital support to SMEs to enable them to adapt and innovate in response to the challenges and opportunities posed by Brexit. From the launch of the scheme on 28 March 2018 to 12 June 2019, the SBCI has received 645 applications. Of these, 582 have been deemed eligible and can proceed to one of the participating finance providers for a loan under the scheme. 139 SMEs have progressed to sanction at finance provider level to a total value of &euro;30, 566,300.<\/p><p>Following on from launch of the Brexit Loan Scheme, a Future Growth Loan Scheme has been developed to provide long-term investment financing for Irish businesses to help them strategically invest in a post-Brexit environment. There is an absence of financing available for businesses in excess of seven years and the Future Growth Loan Scheme is addressing that gap providing loans of eight to ten years.  SBCI's open call to financial institutions for designation as a lending partner closed on 11 February 2019 and the scheme was launched on 27 March.  The SBCI began accepting eligibility applications from SMEs on 17 April 2019.  <\/p><p>The Deputy may rest assured that my Department is committed to supporting Irish small and medium sized businesses and the Government recognises that such businesses are vital for sustainable economic growth and employment. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Central Bank of Ireland Data","counter":276,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04700"},{"type":"question","counter":277,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[24947\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG04800","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a borrower is still considered a private dwelling house borrower or a buy-to-let borrower in the mortgage arrears statistics of the Central Bank in cases in which a borrower originally lived in the house and due to arrears subsequently moved out in order to try to pay the mortgage arrears; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":278,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that the compilation notes for the mortgage arrears statistics define PDH and BTL mortgages as follows:<\/p><p><b>Principal Dwellings (PDH):<\/b><\/p><p>Mortgage loans to private individuals for house or apartment purchase, renovation, improvements or own construction of housing, fully and completely secured by mortgage on the residential property, which is or will be <b><i><i>occupied<\/i><\/i><\/b>by the borrower.<\/p><p><b>Buy-to-Let (BTL)<\/b>: <\/p><p>Mortgage loans to private individuals for house or apartment purchase, renovation, improvements or own construction of housing, fully and completely secured by mortgage on the residential property, which is or will be <b><i><i>let for residential purposes<\/i><\/i><\/b><b><i><\/i><\/b>by the borrower.

The rate was designed to be temporary, but was maintained in subsequent Budgets. In 2016, the Programme for Partnership Government committed to maintaining the 9% VAT rate, dependent on prices remaining competitive in the sector. I decided in Budget 2018 not to make any change to the 9% VAT rate. However, I accepted that the rate must be subject to analysis. In this context, I asked my Department to undertake a comprehensive study of all aspects of the 9% VAT rate ahead of Budget 2019.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;Review of the 9% VAT rate: Analysis of Economic and Sectoral Developments&rdquo; was published by my Department in July 2018, in order to better inform any decision in relation to the 9% reduced rate going forward. In addition to assessing the relevance, cost, value-for-money, and impact to date of the 9% VAT rate, the Review also looked at the estimated impact on the relevant sectors were the rate to be increased.<\/p>  <p>  The Review found that tourism expenditure was more sensitive to income growth and the economic cycle than price changes. The economy is currently performing well, with high levels of employment and strong demand in the tourism sector. This positive economic outlook means that the income channel of demand is likely to ensure that economic activity within the sector remains strong. The Review concluded that the VAT rating applied to the tourism sector should not greatly impact demand or employment in the sector. The Budget decision to increase the VAT rate was made following this analysis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Revenue Commissioners also published a report on the 9% VAT Rate in June 2018 which analyses the output and employment impact of the 9% VAT rate using Revenue data. The analysis found an estimated increase in employment of on average 1.8 employees for each firm benefitting from the reduced rate in the accommodation and food sector in the year following the introduction of the reduced rate. However, beyond the short term, they were unable to distinguish the impact of the rate on employment from the impact of other factors in the economy.<\/p>  <p>  Given the impact of an increase in the VAT rate on the hospitality sector has only recently been reviewed by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, there does not seem to currently be a case for reviewing the impact of the increase.<\/p>  <p>  However, in noting that changes made in Budget 2019 may present a challenge to the tourism and hospitality sector, an extra &euro;35 million was allocated to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in order to provide more targeted supports. This allocation includes targeted supports of &euro;4.5 million for regional initiatives such as Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands and the Wild Atlantic Way, and nearly &euro;10 million for the development of greenways.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG05900"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[25325\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800064#WRG06000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"his views on the country-by-country report of the European Commission recommending that the State limit the scope and number of tax expenditures and broaden the tax base; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1253","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":290,"content":"<p>The European Commission published the draft Country Specific Recommendations (CSRs) on 5 June.<\/p><p>The overall objective of the CSRs is to encourage the Member States to increase their growth potential by continuing to improve their economies and further strengthening their economic resilience.

These include: fire and emergency services; road maintenance and cleaning; street lighting; spatial and development planning and other similar services; regulatory and inspection functions and business support services, as well as libraries, parks, and other recreation and cultural public amenities.  The benefits of these services accrue to all members of society.<\/p>  <p>  A requirement to pay management fees is not relevant in determining whether a property is subject to the LPT.  Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for management fees to property management companies may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees, nor is there provision to offset the VAT paid on management fees against LPT.

Any increase in expenditure in one sector, unless offset by expenditure underspends elsewhere, either voted or non-voted, or additional revenues, would result in a deterioration in the general government surplus from a projected 0.2 per cent of GDP this year and 0.4 per cent of GDP next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800065#WRH05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":349,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800065#WRH05700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Boards Data","counter":348,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800065#WRH05600"},{"type":"question","counter":349,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[25440\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800065#WRH05700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of staff employed at the National Construction Training Centre in Mount Lucas, County Offaly; and the courses available there.","asker":"1232","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":350,"qnumday":165,"qnumall":"[25441\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800065#WRH05800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of participants that received training at the National Construction Training Centre in Mount Lucas, County Offaly in each of the past five years.","asker":"1232","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":351,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.<\/p><p>The National Construction Training Centre in Mount Lucas caters for construction plant training and was established by F&Aacute;S in 2008. <\/p><p>Following the establishment of SOLAS as the agency for further education and training in 2013, responsibility for former F&Aacute;S training centres was transferred to the Education and Training Boards.

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.  This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore I can advise that parents should discuss concerns in relation to their child or young adult, in the first instance, with the Principal involved and request a review of his\/her current Student Support Plan with a view to discussing his\/her response to interventions in place and the appropriateness of involvement of the NEPs psychologist. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations Commission","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ00800"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[24862\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ00900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the case of a person (detail supplied) who received violent threats; the duty of care procedures his Department and the State Examinations Commission have in place for such incidents; the legal avenues he and the commission plan to explore and deploy in relation to the of violent threats received by the person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations.<\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":362,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":363,"qnumday":169,"qnumall":"[24870\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800066#WRJ01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason for cutting the number of special needs assistants, SNAs, from a school (details supplied) from 3.5 to 3.2 for September 2019; if he and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, will urgently review the proposal in order that incoming children for September 2019 in need of vital physical, communication and behavioural assistance will receive the care they need in order to attend school; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1266","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":364,"content":"<p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.  <\/p>  <p>  The NCSE allocates SNA support to schools in accordance with the criteria set out in Department Circular 0030\/2014, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, in order that students who have care needs can access SNA support as and when it is needed.  <\/p>  <p>  In considering applications for SNA support for individual pupils, the NCSE take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources. <\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource.<\/p>  <p>  SNA allocations to all schools can change from year to year as children with care needs leave the school, as new children with care needs enrol in a school and as children develop more independent living skills and their care needs diminish over time.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE Appeals Process may be invoked by a parent or a school where it is considered that a child was not granted access to SNA support because the requirements outlined in Circular 0030\/2014 were not complied with.

The new model differs significantly from the old Resource Allocation Model, in that Special Education Teacher allocation is now frontloaded into schools to support children with special educational needs.  Rather than having to make individual application to the NCSE for additional supports schools can now respond to individual needs in a flexible way and pupils do not have to have a psychological assessment, or a diagnosis of a disability, in order to access Special Education Teaching.  This means that those with highest level of need can access the highest level of support within the school in a timely manner.<\/p>  <p>  Educational Psychologists from my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work with schools using a problem solving model to help schools identify need and interventions to support those needs.  Under the new model, NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they wish to for advice.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. <\/p>  <p>  This system is in line with international best practice and allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological assessment and have equality of access to support prioritised on their individual needs. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore I can advise that parents should discuss concerns in relation to their child or young adult, in the first instance, with the Principal involved and request a review of his\/her current Student Support Plan with a view to discussing his\/her response to interventions in place and the appropriateness of involvement of the NEPs psychologist. <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800068#WRL02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":488,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800068#WRL02300"},{"type":"question","counter":489,"qnumday":215,"qnumall":"[25516\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800068#WRL02400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if SNAs whose employment is terminated as a result of loss of SNA hours in a school will be re-employed should the SNA hours be reinstated on appeal.","asker":"1278","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":490,"content":"<p>The recruitment and appointment of Special Needs Assistants is a matter for the individual school authority in accordance with the relevant Department publications.

In the course of an officer's work he or she may have access to, or hear information concerning the personal affairs of a prisoner and\/or employee.  Such information is strictly confidential. <\/p><p>Any member of the Irish Prison Service who discharges or divulges information to any third party or the media is not only contravening clear policy, but is also contravening the law.  The divulging of information regarding prisoners' private affairs is very damaging to prisoners, to the families of those who are in prison and to the Irish Prison Service.  Such breaches have very real potential to compromise the safety and security of prisoners and prison staff.  Breaches of this nature are an offence under the Prison (Disciplinary Code for Officers) Rules, 1996:  <i>'Breach of Confidence, that is to say, without proper authority, directly or indirectly disclosing, divulging, communicating, publishing or causing to be divulged, communicated or published any information not lawfully available to members of the public which comes to his or her knowledge from official sources or derives from his or her duties.'<\/i><\/p><p>It is open to a Governor, where it appears an officer may have committed a breach of discipline of this nature, to carry out an investigation under the Code of Discipline, and if he or she is satisfied that the alleged breach has occurred, to proceed to an oral hearing on the matter under the Code. The penalties provided for under the Code are (a) a reprimand, or (b) a reprimand plus a reduction in rank or a reduction in pay by deferment of one or more increments for one, three, six or twelve months or any longer period the Governor may specify, or (c) dismissal from the Prison Service.<\/p><p>Any such breach of confidence would also be a breach of the Official Secrets Act 1963 and could be subject to prosecution under Section 13 of that Act.  When officers are recruited to the Irish Prison Service they are required to sign a copy of the Official Secrets Act 1963. Staff are also expected to sign to acknowledge that they have received this particular Act in hardcopy and that they have read and understand it.  During their induction, Officers are educated about the use of information and discretion and are made aware of their legal obligations in this regard. <\/p><p>I can inform the Deputy that in advance of the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect on Friday 25<sup>th<\/sup>May 2018, the Irish Prison Service carried out awareness sessions across the Irish Prison Service estate. The Irish Prison Service continues to take every measure to ensure full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.  A staff obligations note outlining the roles and responsibilities of all staff in relation to Data Protection was issued to all personnel via email, notice boards, internal intranet and via &quot;pop-up&quot; informational messages on each staff members PC.<\/p><p>In addition, staff have been made aware that all accesses to data are recorded and that these records are retained and available for auditing.  Access to and usage of data is subject to periodic examination and audit conducted as part of the Irish Prison Services&rsquo; on-going audit and review process.  Monthly random audits are carried out on our offender management system to ensure business purpose is respected and adhered to by staff accessing prisoners personal data.<\/p><p>I am advised by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that up until the end of 2018 there have been no employees in the Irish Prison Service formally disciplined in response to breaches of Prisoner Privacy.

The Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) sets out the activities in the private security industry which are, or will be, subject to licensing. One of the security services prescribed in the legislation is that of locksmith.  <\/p><p>I have no involvement in the day to day operations of the PSA. I can however inform the Deputy that the taking of applications for the licensing of the locksmith sector came into operation on 1st October 2016 under Statutory Instrument No. 343 of 2016 Private Security (Licensing And Standards) (Locksmith) Regulations 2016.  In accordance with Statutory Instrument No. 344 of 2016, it has been an offence to provide locksmith services without a licence since the 1st day of February 2017.  Providing a service without a licence puts the contractor and their clients at risk of prosecution.<\/p><p>In September, 2016 the PSA provided details of these new regulations on their website. In addition, the PSA ran a radio advertising campaign at the time and annually since then. They also provide details in relation to licensing and regulation of the industry in their newsletter to industry stakeholders. The relevant information notes in relation to the locksmiths sector are - Information Note on Locksmiths and PSA 79 - Locksmiths FAQs which can be found on the PSA website. <\/p><p>Prior to the introduction of licensing the Authority undertook two public consultations on the regulation of the sector.  Following these public consultations the Authority published the licensing requirements for locksmiths in its document, PSA 55:2016, available on the Authority&rsquo;s website. The document outlines the definition of a locksmith as &lsquo;<i>a person, who provides a security service installing, opening, maintaining, repairing or servicing security equipment that,<\/i><\/p><p><i>(a)  consists of mechanical, electronic or other locking devices designed, constructed or adapted to prevent unauthorised access to or within premises where such equipment is situated or<\/i><\/p><p><i>(b)  consists of mechanical, electronic or other locking devices designed, constructed or adapted to prevent unauthorised access to motor vehicles&rsquo;.<\/i><\/p><p>It also includes a person who, in connection with the provision of the services referred to above:<\/p><p>- originates, duplicates or provides, by copy or code, restricted keys or motor vehicle transponder keys (this includes where the provision of such keys is the sole locksmith activity)<\/p><p>- gives advice relating to the installation of such equipment or advice relating to the protection of such devices from damage or interference.<\/p><p>The following do not require a licence:<\/p><p>a) The installation of locks or locking mechanisms that constitute a component of an access control system.<\/p><p>b) Qualified carpenter who installs a mechanical locking device as part of the installation of a door provided that the door does not proceed access to safes or strong rooms<\/p><p>c) Any work on locking mechanisms in doors and windows by a person whose sole or main occupation is the installation of windows and doors, provided:<\/p><p>- the work is undertaken by the person who installed the door or window and is carried out within the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty period or warranty period agreed and documented by the customer and the person at the time of the installation, and<\/p><p>- in the case of a door installation, the door does not provide access to safes or strong rooms.<\/p><p>The Authority regularly meets the various locksmith representative bodies to discuss the regulatory impact on their sector. In recent weeks these discussions have centred on whether there is a need to review the scope of licensing. The Authority will continue to consult with the representative bodies on this issue and if changes to the licensing regime are deemed necessary, they will be made in due course. <\/p><p>The licence fee comprises of two elements, an administration fee of &euro;1,000 and a turnover fee based on the annual turnover of a contractor. The licence issued by the Authority is valid for a two year period. The provision of a regulatory environment has cost implications for the industry. Both the public and the industry benefit from regulation and it is in line with Government policy that industry should fund such regulation. <\/p><p>The Authority has made every effort to ensure that costs are kept to a minimum and reduced fees payable by contractors in 2013. It has also introduced an instalment payment option to assist contractors with paying for their licence.  <\/p><p>Local authorities do not require a licence as the legislation defines a security service <i>as &ldquo;a service provided by a private security employer &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; in the course of an employment or as an independent contractor.&rdquo;<\/i>Local authorities are not a private security employer, however where sub-contractors are engaged in licensed activity, such sub-contractors are required to be licensed by the PSA.  Individual licensing for employees working in the private security industry has not yet been introduced for employees in the locksmith sector. When such licensing is introduced individuals carrying out locksmith work in local authorities will require a license.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800069#WRM04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Naturalisation Applications","counter":575,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800069#WRM04600"},{"type":"question","counter":576,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[25078\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800069#WRM04700","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the progress to date in the determination of an application for naturalisation in the case of a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":577,"content":"<p>I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy continues to be processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.

This approach is aligned with the divisional-focussed Garda model. It is the intention of the Commissioner that the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (GNECB) will guide divisions and provide training in the investigation of insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Cost of Insurance Working Group (CIWG) specifically called for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to explore the potential for further cooperation between it and the insurance sector in relation to insurance fraud investigation. An industry-funded Garda insurance fraud unit was one option considered in this regard. While the Commissioner has indicated that he does not support industry funding of Garda units, he is open to considering other industry-funded proposals to combat insurance fraud, for example, IT projects and\/or the appointment of analysts. <\/p>  <p>  On a wider level, much constructive engagement has taken place, including the commitment by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s Anti-Fraud Forum to meet on a regular basis in order to discuss and act upon current and ongoing general issues which arise in the area of insurance fraud.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the scale of insurance fraud reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the most recent figures available to the Department of Justice and Equality show that, in the period 1 October 2018 (i.e. the date on which the new statistical category of &lsquo;insurance fraud&rsquo; came into being) to end May 2019, 50 incidents of insurance fraud were recorded on PULSE. 50% of these incidents relate to staged collisions (this data is correct as at 6 June 2019, however the data is operational and, therefore, subject to change).<\/p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy will be aware of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Operation Coatee, which targets insurance-related criminality. In April, the GNECB, supported by Lucan Garda Station, CAB and the Armed Support Units, carried out searches in the west Dublin area with a view to submitting files to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Operation Coatee was successful in making a number of important seizures including documentation and financial records.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800070#WRN05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Order Offences","counter":641,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800070#WRN05500"},{"type":"question","counter":642,"qnumday":270,"qnumall":"[25486\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800070#WRN05600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the status of progress in addressing the issue of scramblers and quad bikes; if he will report on the work of the inter-agency group working on this matter; if he will clarify the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1222","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":643,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will already be aware, legal advice received from the Office of the Attorney General indicated that, in the main, current road traffic and public order legislation appear to provide sufficient means to police the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes.

In both instances the vehicles were seized and the drivers were arrested.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800070#WRN05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wards of Court","counter":645,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO00200"},{"type":"question","counter":646,"qnumday":271,"qnumall":"[25497\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO00300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the reason fees charged for a ward of court in circumstances in which the General Solicitor is committee for the person and estate and the family or persons other than the General Solicitor is committee for the person and estate, with particular reference to the income included in calculating the amount and the rate; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":647,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will be aware, the High Court has jurisdiction in Wards of Court matters and management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service which is independent in exercising its functions under the Courts Service Act 1998.

As I indicated in that answer, crime prevention and investigation, including in relation to the involvement of children in crime, are operational matters for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  That being said, I share the Deputy's concern that we do all that we can to prevent children and young people from coming under the influence of criminals.  An important initiative in that regard is the \"Greentown\" project, a research project led by the REPPP Project (Research Evidence into Policy, Programmes and Practice) at the School of Law in the University of Limerick (UL).  The REPPP project is a strategic research partnership with UL which is supported by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and also by my own Department.  Its specific focus is on examining the recruitment by criminal networks of children in Ireland and to make recommendations for interventions to disrupt this. <\/p>  <p>  In the absence of international models of intervention that could be readily deployed, the original Greentown report (December 2016) recommended the design of a programme to include interventions with children and their families to help them withstand the influence of criminal networks.  This new \"Greentown Programme\" has been designed with the input of leading international expertise on crime and criminal networks, together with Irish scientific, policy and practice expertise in child protection and welfare, drugs and community development. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that it is intended to commence a trial of the Greentown Programme approach, on a pilot basis, during 2019. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, I am currently developing a new Youth Justice Strategy with the assistance of an interdepartmental and interagency steering group.  The new Strategy will address the full range of issues relevant to youth justice, including how best to tackle the serious issues raised in the Deputy's Question.  <\/p>  <p>  A key issue here is how to ensure an integrated approach across all agencies, but in particular the relevant child welfare programmes, Garda Youth Diversion Projects and schools, to ensure a sustained and holistic response and that integrated services are provided to respond to the situation of children at risk, tailored to the individual child in the context of the specific family and the specific community and the issues they face.  The new Youth Justice Strategy will be published in draft form for a further round of public consultation before the end of this year and will be finalised early in 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department also provides funding through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) to support the operation of 106 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs).  These projects are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in crime\/anti-social behaviour.   <\/p>  <p>  For 2019, IYJS has a renewed emphasis on preventative work by GYDPs, looking at the child in the context of the specific family and the specific community.  This includes family support work and working with children aged 8 to 11.  The Department also supports pilot projects, to help develop better approaches in areas such as engagement with hard-to-reach or more challenging children, as well as mentoring initiatives.<\/p>  <p>  While the Greentown report was based in one site, a number of other sites have also been used in the research.  Each one of these sites have been given a fictitious name in order to protect the identities of the young people involved in the study and to avoid stigmatising the local community.  A final decision on trial sites for a project intervention has not been made at this time, but in any event the Deputy will appreciate the continued need to keep the identity of the specific areas confidential for the reasons outlined above.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1277"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal Data","counter":654,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO01100"},{"type":"question","counter":655,"qnumday":274,"qnumall":"[25547\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO01200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of claims brought to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of claims settled in 2018 and to date in 2019; the value of the settlements in 2018 and to date in 2019; the number of cases on hand in view of the review he is undertaking; the number of these older than five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":656,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that the number of General Scheme applications received by the Tribunal in 2018 was 174 and to date in 2019 is 71.

One of the main objectives of the EU reform was to improve audit quality.<\/p><p>The resulting Audit Directive (2014\/56\/EU) and Regulation ((EU)(537\/2014)) updated existing EU law and were given effect in S.I. 312 of 2016 and elevated to primary legislation in the Companies (Statutory Audits) Act 2018.  <\/p><p>The Audit Directive put requirements for statutory auditors on a statutory footing such as in relation to assessing and maintaining independence from the audited entity and maintaining professional scepticism.  The Audit Regulation, which has direct effect, introduced additional requirements specifically addressed to auditors of public-interest entities.

The Government further approved the drafting of certain amendments to the Bill, including an amendment prohibiting the use of bot software to circumvent limits on the number of ticket purchases applied by event organisers.  In accordance with the Government decision, the Bill's Second Stage was completed in D&aacute;il Eireann on 21 February 2019 in Government time.<\/p>  <p>  My Department has been working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the preparation of amendments to this Bill which is a priority piece of legislation.  While good progress has been made and it is my aim to finalise the necessary amendments as soon as possible, it is not possible to provide a precise time frame for their completion.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on a number of issues that have arisen in the course of drafting the amendments.  There is a need also to consider whether and how a provision on the resale of tickets acquired through the use of automated means recently agreed by the European Parliament and Council but not yet formally adopted should be integrated into the Bill.  As I have previously informed the Deputy, when the amendments are finalised, the proposed legislation will have to be submitted to the European Commission in accordance with the provisions of Directive (EU) 2015\/1535 on the procedure for the provision of information on technical regulations and rules on information society services.  The Directive requires Member States to postpone the adoption of any legislation within its scope for three months from the date of its submission to the Commission.   <\/p>  <p>  At the conclusion of Second Stage on the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2017 on 18 May 2017, a motion was approved deeming the Bill to be read a second time in nine months to allow for scrutiny by the Select Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  On 20 February 2018, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann agreed to refer the Bill for scrutiny to that Select Committee.  The Committee examined the Bill on 21 May 2018 and published its Scrutiny Report in October 2018.  In its Report, the Committee noted the broad support expressed for the principle of the Bill and recommended that, subject to the receipt of a Money Message, the Bill should proceed to Committee Stage.  The Bill is currently before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Third Stage and awaits a money message.  While I support the aims of the Bill and commend the Deputy for introducing it, it needs to be considered whether devoting further time to it when a Bill supported by Government is progressing would represent the best use of parliamentary time.  In his contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Bill introduced by Deputies Rock and Donnelly, the Deputy himself made the point that the duplication of Bills on the same topic was not a valuable use of D&aacute;il time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800071#WRO06400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Immigration Policy","counter":709,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800072#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":710,"qnumday":292,"qnumall":"[25489\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800072#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the timeline for the review and updating of the Employment Permits Act 2006.","asker":"1215","askee":"1249"},{"type":"speech","counter":711,"content":"<p>The Review of Economic Migration Policy which was completed in 2018 found that, overall, the State&rsquo;s vacancy-led employment permits system provided a robust basis for the management of economic migration, but that the current legislation imposed a degree of inflexibility on the operation of the system.

Implementation of these recommendations is well underway, and progress to date includes recruitment of a National Laboratory QA lead, and development of a project improvement plan for screening quality assurance programmes based on international best practice.

The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority.  This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019.  That is about a 45% increase in the annual budget for home support.<\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the total budget for the service was &euro;416.8 million, providing over 17.5 million hours.  This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people. In 2019 almost &euro;30 million has been added to the home support budget.  When one looks at the year-on-year targets, this means that this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan aims to deliver about 800,000 more hours than what was targeted in the 2018 National Service Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation of funding for home supports, though significant, is finite and services must be delivered within the funding available.  The Home Support Service is not demand led and is therefore operated in line with agreed budgetary limits and targets as set out in the HSE National Service Plan.<\/p>  <p>  The allocation has not been spent for 2019, however, to achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget.  This means that the HSE must manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available.  It also has a responsibility to ensure that activity is planned to anticipate critical demand pressures, most particularly emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year.<\/p>  <p>  While there have been some reports to the contrary recently, it is not correct to say that no new clients will be allocated home supports for the next five months.  However, we know that from the information provided by the HSE, over 6,000 people are waiting for a home support package or additional hours.  The allocation of new hours will be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available. Recycling of hours will continue in line with budgetary management.<\/p>  <p>  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, the Government fully accepts that it needs to be further improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.

The Government has made improved access to home support services a priority. This is reflected in the ongoing additional investment made in these services in recent years with the budget growing from &euro;306 million in 2015 to almost &euro;446 million in 2019. That is about a 45% increase in the annual budget for home support. <\/p>  <p>  In 2018, the total budget for the service was &euro;416.8 million, providing over 17.5 million hours. This year the HSE intends to provide over 18.2 million home support hours, including intensive home care packages, to over 53,000 people. In 2019 almost &euro;30 million has been added to the home support budget. When one looks at the year-on-year targets, this means that this year&rsquo;s National Service Plan aims to deliver about 800,000 more hours than the 2018 target. <\/p>  <p>  To achieve compliance with its funding allocation, the HSE must ensure that the value of the total number of hours provided does not exceed the budget. This means that the HSE must manage its service delivery over the course of the year to align with the total funding available. It also has a responsibility to ensure that activity is planned to anticipate critical demand pressures, most particularly emergency pressures in the initial and latter parts of the year.<\/p>  <p>   It is not correct to say that no new clients will be allocated home supports for the next five months.  The allocation of new hours will be based on clients&rsquo; needs and the resources available. Recycling of hours will continue in line with normal budgetary management.  While the existing home support service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, the Government fully accepts that it needs to be further improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens.   <\/p>  <p>  It is for that reason that the Department is progressing the development of a new statutory scheme and system of regulation for home support services.

Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. For its part the NTPF will aim to deliver 40,000 first Outpatient appointments.<\/p>  <p>  The plan includes a target to reduce the number of patients waiting for and Inpatient\/Day Case procedure from just over 70,000 in December 2018 to 60,000 by year end and to reduce the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019.

Last year saw considerable improvement in the number of patients waiting for procedures. As a result of increased activity and the ongoing collaboration between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), the number of patients waiting for an Inpatient or Day case procedure fell to 70,204 in December 2018, from a peak of 86,100 in July 2017. This represents a reduction of over 18% in the overall number of patients waiting for a procedure. The number of patients waiting more than 3 months fell by more than 17,700, or 31% in the same period .<\/p><p>The impact is particularly notable when one considers the improvements to the Waiting Lists for those particular specialties which were the focus of the Inpatient\/Daycase Action Plan in 2018. These include the numbers waiting over 3 months for a Cataract procedure which fell by 55% from July 2017 to the end of December 2018; the numbers waiting 3 months for a tonsillectomy fell by 65% in the same period; and angiograms fell by 50%.<\/p><p>Budget 2019 announced that the Government had further increased investment in tackling waiting lists, with funding to the NTPF increasing from &euro;55 million in 2018 to &euro;75 million in 2019. The joint Department of Health, HSE, and NTPF Scheduled Care Access Plan 2019 was published on 11th March. Under the Plan, the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will deliver 1.155 million elective inpatient and day case discharges at a value of &euro;1.4 billion in 2019. The Scheduled Care Access Plan includes:<\/p><p>- detailed plans from the NTPF to fund 25,000 IPDC treatments; 5,000 Gastro Intestinal Scopes and 40,000 first outpatient appointments.<\/p><p>- Projections by year end to reduce the overall number of patients on the Inpatient\/Day Case waiting list (excluding GI scopes) from just over 70,200 in Dec 2018 to under 60,000;<\/p><p>- Within this overall reduction the number of patients waiting longer than 3 months will reduce from 40,200 at the end of 2018 to 31,000;<\/p><p>- It is also projected that for ten identified high volume procedures, including tonsillectomies, all clinically suitable patients waiting more than 6 months will be offered treatment in 2019. These 10 procedures account for over a third of the active inpatient day case waiting list and represent 60% of NTPF planned activity in 2019.<\/p><p>A key element of the Scheduled Access Plan is the stabilisation of the Outpatient Waiting List. Under the Plan the HSE, in line with the National Service Plan, will aim to deliver 3.3 million outpatient appointments, of which approximately 1 million will be first appointments. <\/p><p>The plan also includes a target that the number of patients waiting for a first Outpatient appointment will fall from over 516,000 at the end of 2018 to under 509,000 by the end of 2019. This target takes into account the more than 800,000 new patients who will be added to the Outpatient waiting list in 2019; a figure that is based on trends for the previous two years. <\/p><p>While the meeting of short-term targets is always welcome, more can be achieved and, in this regard, the HSE, Department of Health and NTPF, under the Access Plan, will work together with the objective of developing medium-long term improvement initiatives for patient access to hospital procedures. This will include moving care to more appropriate settings and providing care at the lowest level of complexity such as providing ophthalmology in the community; maximising the use of Advanced Nurse Practitioner led clinics; and physiotherapists to manage orthopaedic clinics.<\/p><p>The data requested by the Deputy is outlined in the documents attached.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800080#WRX05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traveller Community","counter":1233,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800080#WRX05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1234,"qnumday":480,"qnumall":"[25506\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800080#WRX06000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 437 of 29 January 2019, when the national Traveller health action plan will be published in view of the fact a commitment was given to publish same by the end of March 2019; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1302","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1235,"content":"<p>The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS) contains a set of specific actions aimed at improving the situation for Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. <\/p><p>Recommendation 73 of the NTRIS states that:<\/p><p>The Health Service Executive will develop and implement a detailed action plan, based on the findings of the All Ireland Traveller Health Study, to continue to address the specific health needs of Travellers, using a social determinants approach.<\/p><p>The HSE circulated a draft of the health action plan to stakeholders in March.

As there will be more scope for adjustments to the scheme under a new Rural Development Programme, consideration was given by the Group to how it might operate more effectively in stimulating organic production in areas where market opportunities are greater.  <\/p>  <p>  CAP negotiations, currently in progress, will ultimately guide and shape the Organic Farming Scheme under the new RDP.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800082#WRZ03400","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1327,"qnumday":513,"qnumall":"[25013\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800082#WRZ03600","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the assessment he carried out in 2018 prior to his announcement to immediately reopen the organic farming scheme; if he will provide a report on the work of the organic sector strategy group; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1349","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1328,"content":"<p>The new Organic Farming Scheme under the current Rural Development Programme has proved extremely successful, attracting more new applicants than any scheme previously, and encouraging a significant number of Irish farmers to convert to organic farming systems.  <\/p>  <p>  The Organic Sector Strategy Group, which Minister Doyle established in March 2018, was tasked with developing a strategy for the development of the Organic Sector for the period up to 2025 and with assessing the justification for a targeted reopening of the Organic Farming Scheme, looking to best economic and environmental outcomes, in accordance with the Group&rsquo;s terms of reference.<\/p>  <p>  A public consultation process provided an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the development of the new strategic plan. This public consultation process combined with an Organic Processing Survey ensured that stakeholders had their views considered in building on the progress made and providing clear direction for further development of the Organic Sector for the next seven years. <\/p>  <p>  According to 2017 Bord Bia research, categories with the greatest growth potential in the domestic market are fruit and vegetables, and dairy.  Notwithstanding the fact that a large proportion of the total organic tillage crop is dedicated to oats, there is insufficient supply to meet demand. Furthermore, the insufficient supply of organic cereals and proteins is inhibiting the growth of the organic dairy, meat, and aquaculture sectors. This deficit in supply also necessitates importation which increases costs of production and therefore impacts competitiveness. The overriding challenge is to ensure that the development of production of organic food products is in line with market requirements and consumer demand. This will be the key to long term sustainable growth of the Irish Organic Food Sector. <\/p>  <p>  Based on this assessment, the Group considered that there was sufficient market demand to justify the reopening of the Organic Farming Scheme on a targeted basis focussing on areas that are in deficit and where market demand is growing.  In addition, the reopening of the Scheme was perceived as one of the most important steps in the future direction and development of the Sector. The Group unanimously agreed that the areas to be targeted should be organic horticulture, cereals and dairy.<\/p>  <p>  The Organic Farming Scheme was re-opened on 19 November, 2018 on a targeted basis.   The closing date for submission of completed on-line applications was 19 December 2018.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the Organic Sector Strategy Group 2019 - 2025 was published in January 2019.

Sovereignty and whether such a rock has a 12-mile territorial sea are separate issues that do not arise in establishing boundaries between continental shelves and EEZs.<\/p><p>The issue of Rockall therefore did not arise in the 2013 Agreement as it was not relevant.  <\/p><p>The 2013 Agreement built on the 1988 Agreement between Ireland and the UK that had already established continental shelf boundaries and provides that those boundaries, slightly adjusted to ensure that no waters were lost to the high seas, shall also be the EEZ boundaries.  This created a single maritime boundary between 12 and 200 miles in the water and on the seabed beneath.<\/p><p>As you are aware, Ireland has never made any claims to Rockall nor have we recognised British claims to sovereignty over it.  Nothing in either Agreement altered that position or represented a departure from our long held view, nor does either Agreement have any implications for the present difficulties between Ireland and Scotland over fishing rights around Rockall.<\/p><p>As regards the situation following Brexit, the Irish and EU position, as set out in the March 2018 European Council Guidelines for negotiations on the future relationship, is that existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources should be maintained.  The 2013 Agreement between Ireland and the UK is not relevant for access by EU vessels to UK waters in that context. <\/p><p>The main purpose of the 2013 Agreement was to resolve jurisdictional uncertainty.  It addressed the situation of fishing vessels seeking to avoid inspection in Irish EEZ areas that overlapped with the UK-claimed areas.  Importantly, however, it also provides the legal certainty necessary for raising finance to develop renewable energy projects in the areas concerned and it resolved confusion over responsibility for dealing with marine pollution incidents in those areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","counter":1379,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA02400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Television Licence Fee","counter":1378,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA02300"},{"type":"question","counter":1379,"qnumday":530,"qnumall":"[24864\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment","minister":"Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment","question":"the full breakdown of the 85% of the licence fee that is directed to RT&Eacute; in order for it to carry out its public service media commitments; the terms and conditions of the granting of the funds to RT&Eacute;; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1226","askee":"1293"},{"type":"speech","counter":1380,"content":"<p>The principle objects of RT&Eacute; are set out under Section 114 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and the allocation of public funding in respect of television licence fee is established under Section 123 of the Act.  <\/p><p>In addition to oversight by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, RT&Eacute; is subject to regulation by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.

For this reason there is limited scope at present for funding projects under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programme.  <\/p>  <p>  Any projects proposed by local authorities for consideration under the Specific or Strategic Grant Programmes are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case project basis and must comply with the requirements of the Public Spending Code and my Department's Capital Appraisal Framework. <\/p>  <p>  This year Specific Improvement Grants totalling &euro;15.2 million were announced in February.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA05500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","counter":1408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA05600"},{"type":"question","counter":1409,"qnumday":542,"qnumall":"[24872\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800083#WRAA05700","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"the expected commencement and completion date for traffic management measures by Transport Infrastructure Ireland at Derryquay, Derrymore East, County Kerry.","asker":"1321","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1410,"content":"<p>As Minister for Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the National Roads Programme.

This means, as part of Project Ireland 2040, a total of &euro;72 million in capital funding is being committed to regional airports over the lifetime of the Plan.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the terms of the capital funding schemes under the Regional Airports Programme, all grant aid to the regional airports including Donegal, IWAK and Kerry is payable on a reimbursement basis only, following the completion of works or the purchase of equipment.  All grant aid claims must show evidence of expenditure before payment is made.<\/p>  <p>  The model of funding put forward by Waterford Airport for this project is new to the Regional Airports Programme.  Given the transformational nature of the project and the assessment of the risks arising, I felt it was prudent to ensure that the Exchequer support in this case would be subject to a number of provisos including the need for the procurement processes to demonstrate that the project can be implemented for &euro;12 million.  In addition, the Exchequer contribution of &euro;5m will only be made on completion of the runway and on confirmation by the Irish Aviation Authority that the expanded runway is authorised for service.<\/p>  <p>  The current runway at Waterford Airport has had a limiting effect on the types of aircraft that can operate there.  As the Deputy will appreciate, this has impacted on the capacity of the airport to attract airlines.  Accordingly, as I stated in my announcement, without the funding to extend the runway to accommodate larger jet aircraft, the future was looking very uncertain for Waterford Airport having had no scheduled air services in place since 2016.<\/p>  <p>  This decision reaffirms this Government's pledge to encourage balanced regional development and to provide equal opportunities for growth and prosperity across all the regions including the South East. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800084#WRBB04800","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1461,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800084#WRBB05400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Services","counter":1460,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800084#WRBB05300"},{"type":"question","counter":1461,"qnumday":563,"qnumall":"[24833\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800084#WRBB05400","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the status of an application for assistance from Tusla by a person (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1462,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases.

The rules for ECCE scheme and the text of the National Childcare Scheme contracts for providers were published on 31st May, together with an Explanatory Guide covering all aspects of the NCS contractual requirements, including the rules relating to children's attendance, and the general operational arrangements for the Scheme.  In addition, the Childcare Support Act 2018 (Payment of Financial Support) Regulations, which are the regulations of most relevance to service providers, have been published, in draft form, so that childcare providers can be fully informed of the terms and conditions of the new Scheme before signing up.<\/p><p>There has been an unprecedented 117% increase in investment in the childcare sector over the last four budgets, now totalling  &euro;575m per year. In securing these significant increases for early learning and care services, I rely substantially on a wide ranging evidence base to underpin my Estimates submissions.  This evidence base is greatly assisted by information obtained directly from early learning and care services, primarily through the annual early years sector profile survey conducted by Pobal. <\/p><p>Given the large amount of public money that is invested by the Exchequer in funding childcare programmes, there needs to be an appropriate level of oversight and accountability.  A high level of compliance with programme rules is vital to maintaining existing investment as well as ensuring future investment. It is a requirement that services operating the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare programmes, funded by my Department, must be compliant with the &lsquo;Rules for DCYA childcare funding programmes&rsquo; which are prepared having regard to relevant central Government rules and guidance around the administration of State funded schemes.  Compliance with these Rules is overseen by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Subsidies for the Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare programmes are paid based on attendance (not enrolment).  This is a vital governance component of the funding for which my Department is responsible.  It is in recognition of this work that I introduced Programme Support Payments for Early Years service providers a number of years ago, now valued at &euro;19.4m per annum.  Each provider receives an annual lump sum over the summer in this regard.<\/p><p>The National Childcare Scheme (NCS), when introduced later this year, will represent a major landmark for all children and families in Ireland, and especially for lower income families and lone parents.  It can be accessed by all families and not just those working or studying full time.  The new Scheme will replace the existing targeted childcare schemes with a single, streamlined and user-friendly scheme.  It entails a fundamental shift away from subsidies grounded in medical card and social protection entitlements, and towards a comprehensive and progressive system of universal and income-based subsidies.  By making this shift, and by tangibly reducing the cost of quality childcare for thousands of families across Ireland, the Scheme aims to improve children's outcomes, support lifelong learning, make work pay and reduce child poverty.  It is also designed to have a positive impact on gender equality in relation to labour market participation and employment opportunities.<\/p><p>Under the auspices of the campaign, a dedicated website was launched, information packs issued to every service provider in the country, and a nationwide training programme for providers commenced.  This programme delivers training across multiple platforms, including classroom-based and online.  It is designed to meet the needs of busy childcare providers and to ensure that they are well prepared to operate the Scheme in advance of its launch.  Communications and training sessions have been very positively received to date: as of now, 3,520 childcare professionals have attended NCS Phase 1 training.  Phase 2 of the training will commence in the coming weeks.  This training is designed to be comprehensive and ensure that providers are prepared and confident to operate the Scheme once it opens.<\/p><p>The new National Childcare Scheme is designed to be flexible, recognising that childcare needs are different for each family.  In creating a single, national scheme, it was important to recognise these differences and create a system that could respond to them without affecting service operations for providers.  For this reason, subsidies will be awarded as an hourly rate, along with a maximum number of hours for which that rate is payable.  The hourly rate of subsidy illustrates to parents their level of subsidy and will not affect service operations.  Parents and providers will continue to work together, as they currently do, to decide on the amount of childcare that is needed and can be provided.  Providers will continue to set their own fees, sessions and admissions policies; there is no change to this.  The scheme will pay subsidies based on the hours of care agreed between the provider and the parent, up to the maximum hours awarded to the parent.  Providers are not required to change their operations to run their services on an hourly basis.<\/p><p>As regards the workforce issues mentioned. the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School Aged Care (SAC) sector is recognised as a sector in which low pay and high turnover of staff are common.  The 7% increase in ECCE capitation I secured from September 2018 was designed to specifically target these areas and support employers to improve terms and conditions.  I look forward to seeing the result of this initiative in the sector profile survey for 2019.  Further, I have been a strong advocate of a  Sectoral Employment Order (SEO) as a mechanism to address issues of pay and conditions in the early years sector.  An SEO would provide for mandatory terms and conditions in the childcare sector, minimum rates of remuneration, pensions, and sick leave along with a dispute resolution procedure but will require an employee representative body to progress.<\/p><p>In addition, First 5, the Whole of Government Strategy for Babies, Young Children and their Families, includes a commitment to review the funding model for the ELC sector, under which employers will be supported to provide more favourable working conditions to attract and retain staff.  The new funding model will leverage additional investment for certain criteria, for example, better pay, or full implementation of the curriculum.  It is envisaged that this may open up alternative mechanisms by which the State could incentivise services to meet national standards in relation to wages and\/or working conditions.  Officials from my Department have commenced work on the development of a Workforce Development Plan, which will identify practical steps to achieve First 5 commitments.<\/p><p>Other initiatives I have introduced which have assisted  in improving conditions in the sector include: <\/p><p>- The development of paid CPD (continuous professional development)<\/p><p>- Development of multi-award winning training opportunities  (LINC)<\/p><p>- Enhanced career options for graduate staff which includes Inspector positions in Tusla, the Department of Education Early Years Inspectorate, and positions to support quality and inclusion development within Better Start.<\/p><p>- Additional investment in higher capitation in relation to the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme  which has seen the number of services employing graduates  rise from 11% to 50% and attracts &euro;24m of additional funding annually<\/p><p>- The incentivisation of school age childcare services to enable part time Early Learning and Care services offer full time contracts to staff <\/p><p>From September 2018, all children meeting the minimum age requirement of 2 years and 8 months are eligible for a full two programme years on the Early Childhood Care and Education programme (ECCE).  This measure refines the development introduced the previous year and increases the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a previous average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years).  This delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. <\/p><p>As regards issues of consultation, both my Department and I are very active in our consultations with the early years sector.  These consultations are both formal, through structures such as the Early Years Forum, stakeholder groups established as part of the NCS project, various Open Policy Debates held each year; and informal, through almost daily meetings and other interactions with front line service professionals, providers and representative groups.<\/p><p>Finally, to address the issue of tax credits, the possibility of allowing a tax credit to parents for the provision of childcare was discussed by the Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland.  The purpose of the group was &quot;..to identify and assess policies and future options for increasing the quality, accessibility (including supply) and affordability of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.&quot;  The report of the IDG was published on 22nd July 2015.  The IDG considered both supply and demand side measures in terms of supporting parents by removing barriers including the specific issue of affordability.  The Group was particularly mindful of the views expressed in the consultation with parents regarding the possible introduction of a tax credit.  Looking at the current mix of universal and targeted schemes, and having considered the option of a tax credit, the Group concluded that investment in supply side measures was strategically optimal in achieving the combined objectives of affordability, accessibility and quality.  In comparison with other measures, the introduction of a tax credit does not bring sufficient impact to the policy objectives.  In particular, the Group was concerned that a tax credit measure would not necessarily achieve that purpose.  Further information from the report of the IDG is available on my Department's website: <i>www.dcya.gov.ie<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Guardians Ad Litem","counter":1482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC01700"},{"type":"question","counter":1483,"qnumday":570,"qnumall":"[25257\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost of guardians ad litem; the number employed by Tusla in each of the years 2017 and 2018; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1484,"content":"<p>Guardians Ad Litem are appointed by judges in child care proceedings under Section 26 of the Child Care Act, 1991.

The 2018 amounts have been paid out by this Department.  The 2019 amounts have not yet been paid out.<\/p><p>All of these three programmes were administered by Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs), with support from the local authorities.  Local Development Committees (LDCs) were not involved in that process.<\/p><p>Lists of approved projects under the 2017 Communities Facilities Scheme, the 2017 RAPID programme, and the 2018 CEP are provided in the below links. In some cases there is a delay in drawdown of this funding by community groups, for example, due to a delay in completing the approved work.  This causes a delay in having final figures for some areas.  The Department has written to the LCDC in each area asking for confirmation of final amounts provided to community groups and will provide this to the Deputy when it is available.  It is not anticipated that there will be any significant difference between the amounts paid out by the Department to each LCDC\/LA and the amounts paid out by that LCDC\/LA to community groups.<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Local Authority area<\/th><th>2018 CEP Allocation<\/th><th>2019 CEP Allocation<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Carlow <\/td><td>&euro;259,285<\/td><td>&euro;134,206<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cavan <\/td><td>&euro;274,141<\/td><td>&euro;134,757<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Clare <\/td><td>&euro;336,239<\/td><td>&euro;139,257<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork City<\/td><td>&euro;472,567<\/td><td>&euro;149,241<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Cork<\/td><td>&euro;650,400<\/td><td>&euro;160,762<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Donegal <\/td><td>&euro;632,449<\/td><td>&euro;159,461<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dublin City<\/td><td>&euro;1,364,607<\/td><td>&euro;212,306<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown<\/td><td>&euro;369,788<\/td><td>&euro;142,108<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Fingal <\/td><td>&euro;493,131<\/td><td>&euro;150,521<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway City<\/td><td>&euro;233,676<\/td><td>&euro;132,455<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Galway <\/td><td>&euro;397,778<\/td><td>&euro;143,401<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kerry <\/td><td>&euro;382,630<\/td><td>&euro;142,409<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kildare <\/td><td>&euro;468,672<\/td><td>&euro;148,013<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Kilkenny <\/td><td>&euro;289,901<\/td><td>&euro;136,319<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Laois <\/td><td>&euro;294,177<\/td><td>&euro;136,524<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Leitrim <\/td><td>&euro;189,068<\/td><td>&euro;129,223<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Limerick<\/td><td>&euro;542,485<\/td><td>&euro;152,942<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Longford <\/td><td>&euro;234,155<\/td><td>&euro;132,385<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Louth<\/td><td>&euro;418,627<\/td><td>&euro;145,542<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Mayo <\/td><td>&euro;425,542<\/td><td>&euro;145,203<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Meath <\/td><td>&euro;393,662<\/td><td>&euro;142,893<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Monaghan <\/td><td>&euro;238,172<\/td><td>&euro;132,571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Offaly <\/td><td>&euro;322,142<\/td><td>&euro;138,550<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Roscommon <\/td><td>&euro;248,252<\/td><td>&euro;133,301<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sligo <\/td><td>&euro;263,402<\/td><td>&euro;134,084<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>South Dublin <\/td><td>&euro;750,743<\/td><td>&euro;169,399<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Tipperary<\/td><td>&euro;486,017<\/td><td>&euro;149,690<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Waterford <\/td><td>&euro;402,777<\/td><td>&euro;144,499<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Westmeath <\/td><td>&euro;303,516<\/td><td>&euro;136,571<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wexford <\/td><td>&euro;494,079<\/td><td>&euro;150,065<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wicklow<\/td><td>&euro;367,921<\/td><td>&euro;141,343<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>&euro;13,000,000<\/td><td>&euro;4,500,000<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2017 Communities Facilities Fund are on the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2017 RAPID programme are on the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2018 Community Enhancement Programme are on the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p><p>Details on approved projects for the 2018 Men&rsquo;s Shed fund (under the Community Enhancement Programme) are on the following link:<\/p><p><i><\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1334"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Enhancement Programme Funding","counter":1510,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1511,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[25059\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800085#WRCC04700","dept":"Department of Rural and Community Development","minister":"Minister for Rural and Community Development","question":"if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a group (details supplied) has been excluded from availing of the grant from the men's sheds fund; the reason for this exclusion; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1299","askee":"1334"},{"type":"speech","counter":1512,"content":"<p>In 2019, my Department is providing funding of &euro;4.5m for community groups through its Community Enhancement Programme (CEP).

With this in mind, I launched a public consultation on the design of the TCA on the 28th of May 2018 to which a wide variety of stakeholder groups were invited.  A number of workshops were also held on the day to elicit views and feedback. <\/p><p>Shortly afterwards, Oireachtas members were invited to a detailed briefing by my officials in Leinster House.  The consultation was open for over 3 months and the Department received almost 300 responses from individuals and organisations.  Those submissions outlined the views of respondents on the issues of most interest to them including how self-employed people and Class S PRSI contributions since 1988 could be treated.<\/p><p>Having carefully examined the outputs of the consultation process, my Department is now designing the scheme and I intend to shortly bring a proposal to Government setting out that design.  When the Government has agreed the approach to be taken, I will initiate the work required to introduce this reform.  <\/p><p>I believe that the Deputy's comments are a reference to a story printed in a farming publication recently, which made erroneous claims about this reform.  I am informed that the publication in question has since then published a correction. <\/p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Employment Schemes Data","counter":1540,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD01400"},{"type":"question","counter":1541,"qnumday":590,"qnumall":"[24903\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD01500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the average cost of a community employment scheme employee; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1303","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1542,"content":"<p>Community Employment (CE) schemes are typically sponsored by groups (known as CE Sponsors) wishing to benefit the local community.

This commitment is recognised in both the Programme for Government and the National Carers&rsquo; Strategy.  The main income supports provided by my Department are Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit and the Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant.<\/p>  <p>  Carer's Benefit is a payment made to insured people who leave the workforce to care for a person or persons in need of full-time care and attention. It is payable for a maximum period of 104 weeks in respect of each person receiving care.  It can be taken in one single period or in separate periods as long as the combined total does not exceed 104 weeks for each care recipient. <\/p>  <p>  Being a full-time carer means that the carer must be living with or in a position to provide full-time care and attention to a person in need of care who is not living in an institution.  However, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit can continue to be paid on a short-term basis and the carer continues to be regarded as providing full-time care and attention, if they or the person being cared for is having medical or other treatment in a hospital or other institution for a period not longer than 13 weeks. This conditionality is set out in the respective legislative provisions governing the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and Carer&rsquo;s Support Grant schemes. <\/p>  <p>  The 13 week provision is to ensure that the carer can continue to be paid when they themselves require medical treatment that requires them to spend some time in hospital, or when the person they are caring for requires medical care or respite on a short-term basis. <\/p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme is considered the \"safety net\" within the overall social welfare system in that it provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, my Department may award a supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the a person's own resources and which are deemed to be necessary.  In addition, the Department can make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.

These supports include the JobPath service, the Local Employment Service, Job Clubs, T&uacute;s and Community Employment (CE). The primary purpose of JobPath is to provide a case management based, employment advice and counselling service to long term unemployed jobseekers.  This is the group of jobseekers facing the most significant barriers to entering full-time employment.<\/p><p>My Department selects clients for the JobPath service by means of a random selection process. Between July 2015 and May 2019, just over 226,850 jobseekers had commenced their engagement period with the JobPath service. Protocols for selection currently preclude the selection of anyone who has already completed 52 weeks with the JobPath service within the previous four months. If, however, at the end of this period the jobseeker has not engaged in other activation supports and services, they then become eligible for selection for a subsequent period of activation on the JobPath service. This is necessary to ensure that they continue to receive a case management service.<\/p><p>To date, 27,830 jobseekers have been referred to the service more than once. Of these, 27,476 jobseekers have commenced a second engagement period, having previously availed of the service and 354 people have commenced a third engagement period. Jobseekers referred for a subsequent referral will start working with a Personal Advisor who will review their development during their previous engagements with the service and together they will prepare a new personal progression plan to build on that progress. The actions and tasks agreed will be based on their previous engagements, with particular focus on any remaining barriers preventing the person from moving into full-time suitable employment.<\/p><p>To date, some 51,500 jobseekers have commenced employment during their engagement period with JobPath as set out in table 1 below. It should be noted that the figures presented are representative of the entire cohort of JobPath clients between July 2015 and May 2019 and all job starts in the same period. Many clients who are currently engaged with JobPath are still in the first phase of the service and will not have had sufficient time with the service to have gained employment nor sustain that employment for up to 52 weeks. Performance will improve as more clients complete their engagement with the service and have a chance to reach 52 weeks in employment. <\/p><p>Between July 2015 and the end of December 2017 - a time period where the full impact of JobPath and job sustainment can now be measured - 146,849 jobseekers, mostly more than two years unemployed, had engaged with the JobPath service of whom 37,610 had commenced employment.  These employment start and sustainment rates are significantly higher than the historical counterfactual level prior to JobPath, employment progression rates for this group - even during periods of economic growth.<\/p><p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all set-up and day-to-day operational costs are borne by the companies.  The companies are paid on the basis of performance and with the exception of the initial registration fee; payments are made only when a client has achieved sustained employment.  The overall cost of JobPath will be determined by the number of people who participate in the programme and the number who get sustainable jobs. The total of fees claimed by the JobPath providers to the end of May 2019 is &euro;182 million.<\/p><p>The T&uacute;s initiative is a community work placement scheme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people. These work opportunities benefit the community and are provided by community and voluntary organisations in both urban and rural areas. There are currently 6,500 budgeted places on T&uacute;s involved in the delivery of local services.  <\/p><p>The aim of Community Employment is to enhance the employability and mobility of disadvantaged and unemployed persons by providing work experience and training opportunities for them within their communities.  Virtually all participants are engaged in some element of service support and delivery - e.g. amenities management, sports, tidy towns, childcare, etc. There are currently 921 Community Employment schemes catering for 21,371 participants.<\/p><p>Persons who are engaged with CE and T&uacute;s do not get referred to JobPath. Since June 2018, long-term jobseekers engaged with the JobPath service can also apply for either Community Employment or T&uacute;s should they wish to do so. This enables those people with the JobPath service to avail of a CE or T&uacute;s placement which provides valuable occupational activity and work experience. However, continued engagement with the JobPath service is a condition of opting to avail of both schemes.  Of the 74,000 currently engaged with the JobPath service, 1,537 are availing of a CE placement and 1,226 are availing of T&uacute;s placement. <\/p><p>I trust that this clarifies matter for the Deputy.<\/p><p><br \/>Table 1: JobPath referrals and employment sustainments as of 31 May 2019<\/p><p><table><tr><th>Jobseekers referred<\/th><th>226,851<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseekers with multiple referrals<\/td><td>27,830<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseekers with a second referral<\/td><td>27,476<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobseekers with a third referral<\/td><td>354<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Commenced employment<\/td><td>51,548<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs sustained for 13 weeks to date<\/td><td>31,186<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs sustained for 26 weeks to date<\/td><td>24,234<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs sustained for 39 weeks to date<\/td><td>18,808<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Jobs sustained for 52 weeks to date<\/td><td>14,617<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pension (Contributory) Data","counter":1565,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1566,"qnumday":601,"qnumall":"[25024\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800086#WRDD04400","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who have had their State pension (contributory) payment reviewed; the number of reviews in which the payment rate was found to be incorrect; the number of persons who have seen an increase in their pension payment; and the value of increases being awarded.","asker":"1252","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1567,"content":"<p>Since late September 2018, my Department has been examining the social insurance records of approximately 90,000 pensioners, born on or after 1 September 1946, who have a reduced rate State pension contributory entitlement based on post Budget 2012 rate-bands.

The package is also available to some people under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 April 2012, new applicants in receipt of Carers Allowance who are not living with the person for whom they provide care do not have an automatic entitlement to the household benefits package.

WFP is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment. Estimated expenditure on WFP in 2018 is approximately &euro;430 million and it is currently paid to 53,327 families in respect of some 120,142 children.<\/p>  <p>  To qualify for WFP, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.<\/p>  <p>  The &ldquo;hours worked&rdquo; eligibility criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme in 1984, from 30 hours per week to 19 hours per week in 1996. Indeed, a recent review of in-work supports found that the current range of supports works very well for the vast majority of families and facilitates an element of choice which allows them to select the option which best suits their needs.<\/p>  <p>  For low income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for WFP and working on a casual basis (that is, up to and including 3 days per week) the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance (JA) scheme provides in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments .  <\/p>  <p>  Apart from the jobseeker schemes if a person cannot meet the 19 hours WFP threshold or if their hours vary significantly from week to week, the Department offers a number of other schemes which can provide income support that can be combined with earnings from employment, subject to each individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  These include One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) and the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Transitional Payment (JST), and the Part-Time Job Incentive (PTJI) scheme <\/p>  <p>  Further reducing the hours worked requirement would have a number of effects. The number of families working between 15-18 hours and are earning below the relevant WFP thresholds is currently unknown which means it is not possible to estimate a full year cost of reducing the hours. Reducing the numbers of hours worked required to access WFP from 19 to 15 could have a number of behavioural effects, the increased cost of which is difficult to predict. These effects include:<\/p>  <p>  - reducing the incentive to increase part-time hours, resulting in recipients on the minimum 19 hours threshold reducing their hours of work;<\/p>  <p>  - attracting new recipients currently on higher wages above the WFP threshold, who might decide to reduce their hours in order to qualify.<\/p>  <p>  - greater dependency on WFP to support very low earnings.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that WFP does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment.  The longer term goal of WFP, as an incentive to take up and remain in work, could be compromised if the nature of the work taken up is not ultimately sustainable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800088#WRFF01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes Data","counter":1647,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800088#WRFF01200"},{"type":"question","counter":1648,"qnumday":632,"qnumall":"[25129\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800088#WRFF01300","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost of allowing lone parents in employment whose children are aged between seven and 14 years of age to receive both jobseeker's transition payment and the working family payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1227","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1649,"content":"<p>My Department provides a number of options for income support to lone parents once their entitlement to the One-Parent Family Payment (OFP) ceases.

In any year about 85% of all claims are awarded by the Department and just 1% are appealed.  Nevertheless, the Department is concerned that these cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Accordingly, significant efforts and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeal process in recent years.  As a result, appeal processing times in respect of all schemes improved between 2011 and 2017 from 52.5 weeks for an oral hearing in 2011 to 26.4 weeks in 2017 and from 25.1 weeks for a summary decision in 2011 to 19.8 weeks in 2017. The corresponding processing times for the year 2018 were 30 weeks for an oral hearing and 24.8 weeks for a summary decision. There has been some improvement to date in 2019 with an oral hearing decision taking on average 28.2 weeks and a summary decision taking 23.3 weeks. <\/p>  <p>  The average waiting time is calculated from the date the appeal is registered. The time taken to process an appeal reflects a number of factors including that the appeals process is a quasi-judicial process with appeals officers being required to decide all appeals on a &lsquo;de-novo&rsquo; basis.  In addition, appeals decisions are themselves subject to review by the High Court and decisions have to be formally written up to quasi-judicial standards.  Other factors that influence appeals processing times include the quality of the initial decision &ndash; in this respect the Department has changed the decisions process in respect of medical schemes, in order to provide more information to the claimant.  I expect that this will help to reduce the number of appeals over time.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a number of new Appeals Officers have joined the Appeals Office over the past 12-18 months, to replace staff leaving on retirement.  Given the complexity of the appeals process it takes some time for new staff to be trained up and develop expertise and this has led to somewhat longer processing times during this period.  The Chief Appeals Officer has advised me that appeal processing times continue to be a priority for her Office. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, where a claimant has been refused a social welfare payment, regardless of the scheme involved, and is appealing that decision, if their means are insufficient to meet their needs it is open to them to apply for supplementary welfare allowance in the interim.  <\/p>  <p>  If their application for supplementary welfare allowance is refused, they can also appeal that decision.  The supplementary welfare allowance appeal will be prioritised for attention within the Appeals Office as soon as the appeal file and submission is received from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800089#WRGG00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":1702,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800089#WRGG00900"},{"type":"question","counter":1703,"qnumday":652,"qnumall":"[25612\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800089#WRGG01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a decision on the review of a disability allowance application in which a review was requested and no decision has been made; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1704,"content":"<p>Following the submission of further medical evidence by the person concerned, their case has been reviewed and they have been awarded disability allowance with effect from 17 October 2018.

There are currently 36 differential rents schemes in operation nationwide.

The plan sets out a framework that will guide the phased development of enhanced visitor experiences and improved visitor facilities at our national parks and nature reserves, taking into account our conservational objectives and based upon research into international best practice.<\/p>  <p>  The plan recommends a suite of capital projects of varying size from smaller scale interventions, such as the installation of viewing platforms, to larger projects such as the development of new boardwalks and trails and the construction of new visitor centres. From these proposals, projects will be funded jointly by my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland through a multimillion euro investment package over the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  The first such project is a &euro;2.1 million investment in the Wild Nephin-Ballycroy National Park, which was announced on 31 August 2018. The aim of the project is to develop a continuous 53 km walking and cycling trail from Newport to Ballycastle on the Wild Atlantic Way through the national park.\u00a0 The project will endeavour to provide more direct and safe routes on tracks through bogland, forests and challenging terrain.<\/p>  <p>The next project is a &euro;1.9 million investment for developments in Connemara National Park, announced on 3rd  \u00a0December 2018. Works to be carried out are based on elements contained in Outdoor Recreation Northern Ireland&rsquo;s report Feasibility and Scoping Assessment Of Possible Links from Connemara National Park to Kylemore Abbey.\u00a0\u00a0In brief, the funding will provide opportunities for improvement and enhancement of recreational trails, increased accessibility of trails and development of new trails.\u00a0 This will dissipate the visitor load and improve the quality of the visitor experience.<\/p>  <p>  Our historic buildings and structures are also a vital part of our heritage. While the primary responsibility to care for and maintain our built heritage structures rests with the owner, the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund invest essential capital in our built heritage and help the owners and custodians of historic structures to safeguard them into the future for the benefit and enjoyment of communities and the public. There are almost 50,000 protected structures around the country. Many of them are in great need of investment to ensure their preservation and continued use so that they remain a living part of our history and community life into the future. Last April, funding of some &euro;3.3 million was allocated to 431 projects across every local authority area under the built heritage investment scheme and the structures at risk fund. These projects are well under way with funding due to be drawn down in the final quarter of the year. I am pleased to note the structures at risk fund will be revised and refreshed as the historic structures fund for 2019. This will offer improved supports to those who work hard in our communities to ensure our historic buildings remain alive and in use so that they are passed to future generations in better condition than we found them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800090#WRHH04500","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme Payments","counter":1791,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800090#WRHH04600"},{"type":"question","counter":1792,"qnumday":685,"qnumall":"[24882\/19]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2019061800090#WRHH04700","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not received further payments under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme.","asker":"1272","askee":"1243"},{"type":"speech","counter":1793,"content":"<p>An application for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was received by my Department from the individual referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question.
