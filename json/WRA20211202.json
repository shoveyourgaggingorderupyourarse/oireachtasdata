For cross border consumer protection issues, the CCPC is part of the European Consumer Protection Co-operation (CPC) Network, which is comprised of national authorities responsible for enforcing EU consumer protection laws. This network protects consumers when conducting transactions across national borders and allows consumer protection agencies to co-operate to resolve particular consumer issues. I am advised by the CCPC that the CPC Network is central to addressing this matter, which involved the purchase of properties in France. These properties were developed, marketed, sold and managed by French traders under a French &lsquo;Residence de Tourisme&rsquo; scheme devised by the French Government to provide tourist accommodation in France. Under the European CPC network, the appropriate authorities to conduct an investigation in relation to this matter are the French consumer protection authorities &ndash; Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la R&eacute;pression des Fraudes (&lsquo;DGCCRF&rsquo;). <\/p>  <p>  The CCPC assures me that it has engaged with the DGCCRF with respect to the issues highlighted by Irish property purchasers of these French properties. The CCPC received complaints from Irish property purchasers and provided an initial preliminary assessment to the DGCCRF for over 150 complainants. Following consultation with the DGCCRF, the CCPC collated and transferred to the DGCCRF the transactional documentation of over 150 Irish complainants. The CCPC has and continues to provide significant time and resources to this matter and to supporting the DGCCRF investigation. In addition, throughout the period of engagement with the DGCCRF, whenever issues have been raised by complainants or where they have requested the CCPC to forward additional documentation to DGCCRF in relation to any matters, the CCPC has done so and acted in accordance with DGCCRF instructions to ensure compliance with French legal requirements regarding criminal investigations.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The DGCCRF are investigating the issues that were referred to the CCPC by the complainants involved. The primary focus of the CCPC is to continue to support the DGCCRF investigation through providing any assistance or information requested by the DGCCRF. The CCPC has not yet received the final report of the DGCCRF investigation. The CCPC has kept lines of communication open with the complainants and has updated complainants when such updates have been provided by the DGCCRF. That will continue to be the case. \u00a0The DGCCRF have advised that they will inform the CCPC when reports are handed over to the Public Prosecutor in France and they will draw the Public Prosecutor&rsquo;s attention to the importance of keeping Irish complainants informed about the state of play of proceedings. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The CCPC considers this matter as a high priority issue and one which they have dedicated considerable resources.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200084#WRB00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1596"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Consultations","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200084#WRB00500"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[59679\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200084#WRB00600","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"when the stakeholder consultation of his Department on the International Labour Organisation Convention 190, Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work is due to commence.","asker":"1466","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":16,"content":"<p>The ratification of ILO Convention C190 is a matter of priority for Ireland and my Department officials continue to work towards being amongst the first ILO member States to ratify, with plans to progress the ratification soon.\u00a0<\/p><p>The issue of ratification by Ireland of International Labour Organisation Convention 190, Elimination of Violence and Harassment in the World of Work, is being considered in the context of our standard approach to the ratification of international instruments.

The VAT Directive obliges each Member State to have a standard rate of VAT and also allows that a Member State may choose to have no more than two reduced rates of VAT, which may be no less than 5%, and which may be applied to certain goods and services:\u00a0 any of those listed in Annex III of the Directive.\u00a0Within this framework, Ireland currently applies a standard rate of 23% and two reduced rates of 13.5% and 9%. <\/p>  <p>  The EU Directive permits derogations from the general rules to allow an individual Member State to continue certain historic tax treatments, such as the application of one of their reduced rates to particular goods and services which are not included in Annex III.\u00a0 Ireland, in line with the VAT Directive and by way of special derogation from the general rule, maintains several &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; provisions and derogations that allow us to maintain reduced rates to certain supplies for historical reasons.\u00a0It is on this basis that Ireland applies its 13.5% reduced rate of VAT to the supply of fuel, gas, oil, and electricity services for both domestic and commercial use. The current 13.5% VAT rate applied to energy products is a &lsquo;parked rate&rsquo;, governed by Article 118 of the VAT Directive and standstill provisions from 1991 and cannot be reduced below 12%.<\/p>  <p>  Article 102 of the VAT Directive provides that, after consultation with the EU VAT Committee, a Member State may choose to apply a reduced rate (no less than 5%) to the supply of natural gas, electricity, or district heating on a temporary basis.\u00a0 The EU Commission recently indicated that this provision could now be used by Member States without the requirement to consult the VAT Committee in advance.<\/p>  <p>  Under its existing provisions, Ireland already applies a reduced VAT rate to a broader range of energy products (including the supply of fuel, gas, oil and electricity services) than would be allowed under Article 102, which is restricted only to supplies of natural gas, electricity, district heating.<\/p>  <p>  Because a Member State may only have a maximum of two reduced rates, if Ireland were to consider introducing a new reduced rate, even on a temporary basis, for the supply of natural gas, electricity and district heating as allowed under Article 102 of the Directive, then it would not be permissible to also continue both of our existing reduced rates of 9% and 13.5%.\u00a0 This would mean that one of those existing rates would have to be removed and the goods and services covered by those rates would have to move either to one of the other reduced rates or to the standard rate.\u00a0 However, there is a significant restriction on this, as the services to which the 13.5% reduced rate applies on a historic basis (i.e. the &ldquo;parked&rdquo; services) cannot be moved to a rate below 12%.\u00a0 Therefore, depending on the reduced rates chosen, this restriction could mean that the services that are currently at the &lsquo;parked \u00a0rate&rsquo;, would have to move to the standard rate of 23%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200085#WRC02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":90,"content":"<p>Question No. 29 answered with Question No. 28.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":91,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200085#WRC02200"},{"type":"question","counter":92,"qnumday":30,"qnumall":"[59690\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200085#WRC02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if he has plans to modify the accumulated rates of VRT, NOX surcharges and tariffs that apply to the importation of vehicles from Northern Ireland which is causing a disproportionate hardship to persons in the Border region by driving up the price of second-hand vehicles; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1547","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":93,"content":"<p>VRT is a tax chargeable on the registration of vehicles in the State and is levied as a percentage of the open market selling price (OMSP) of the vehicle.

The monument is protected under the National Monuments Acts as a Recorded Monument but it is not a national monument in State care. The bid was based on a valuation by OPW and on an archaeological and operational assessment that the monument would be an excellent addition to the portfolio of monuments in state care in Sligo, adding to the ensemble of Neolithic passage tombs, many of which are already in State care, and which characterise the Sligo landscape. Unfortunately, the vendor chose to not accept the bid put forward at the time. The monument is on private land and there is no public right of way to it.<\/p>  <p>  Sligo's numerous passage tombs are a remarkable asset, with a deep interconnection with the surrounding landscape.

The list is an inventory of properties which have potential to demonstrate Outstanding Universal Value and therefore considered suitable for nomination to the World Heritage List in due course.

Homelessness is complex and causal factors and family circumstances vary considerably as do the responses needed. Homelessness is also inter-related with the other areas of the housing system and with broader social and healthcare policy and service delivery.\u00a0Therefore, a whole of Government approach\u00a0is required in dealing with this challenge.<\/p>  <p>  An important aspect of this plan is supporting families and children experiencing homelessness. Family homelessness, including lone-parent homelessness,\u00a0has seen an appreciable reduction since 2019, but still remains a key challenge. The overriding objective is to provide homes to those households at risk of or experiencing homelessness through the various social housing supports available. <\/p>  <p>  Many families have found themselves trapped in long term homelessness. Housing for All commits my Department\u00a0to working with Local Authorities and NGOs to identify families experiencing long-term homelessness that have complex support needs.

Updated guidance for schools on Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools was provided at the end of May following the work of an expert group that carefully considered the role of ventilation in managing COVID-19. <\/p><p>A copy of the guidance is published on the Gov.ie website. <\/p><p>The Expert Group in its report notes &ldquo;<i>very good advice is contained in the Department of Education&rsquo;s Practical Steps for the Deployment of Good Ventilation Practices in Schools<\/i>&rdquo;<\/p><p>And that &ldquo;<i>It must be emphasized that ventilation should be delivered as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The over-arching approach in the guidance is for schools to have windows open as fully as possible when classrooms are not in use and partially open when classrooms are in use. <\/p><p>The Expert Group also note &ldquo;<i>consider<\/i><i>using a portable carbon dioxide (CO<\/i><i><sub>2<\/sub><\/i><i>) monitor to identify areas of the school with inadequate ventilation<\/i>. The Departments guidance outlines CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors can play a part in providing a useful general indication that areas\/rooms may not be adequately ventilated. They can enable occupants to become familiar with the impacts of activities, outdoor weather and window openings on levels of good ventilation. The provision of portable CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors provides schools with the flexibility to focus their use to those rooms where most beneficial to inform strategies for optimising ventilation in the school. <\/p><p>In excess of 35,400 monitors were delivered to schools nationwide at a cost of circa &euro;4 million. <\/p><p>A dedicated team has been established in the Department to support schools that may have concerns about ventilation. Officers are also available to contact schools where required, walking through the steps the schools should take to deploy good ventilation practices etc.  Where it is not possible for a school to access the expertise of an engineer or architect, and where necessary, a technical assessment to assist the school can be facilitated through the Department.<\/p><p>Schools that identify inadequate ventilation in a room can utilise their minor work grant (for minor improvements) or apply for emergency works grant assistance to address ventilation enhancements on a permanent basis.<\/p><p>The Expert Group also notes the potential use for air cleaners<i>&ldquo;consider using stand-alone high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter devices to further reduce airborne virus in poorly ventilated spaces&rdquo;<\/i><\/p><p>The Departments Guidance is clear that where the recommended measures in the Practical Steps and poor ventilation continues to exist in a particular room\/area, air cleaners may be considered as an additional measure in conjunction with other methods of ventilation that are available. This is line with Expert Group guidance which identifies that in areas with poor ventilation that structural interventions and measures to increase natural ventilation should be completed. Where such structural interventions or measures are not possible in the short term, that consideration should be given to using stand-alone HEPA filter devices in poorly ventilated spaces pending the completion of structural interventions.<\/p><p>There is no one solution that fits all scenarios, each application requires bespoke analysis and selection of the appropriate unit(s) matched to the specific room size and volume. If, following consultation with a supplier a school feels that its individual space may require specific technical specialist advice then the assistance of a Chartered Engineer or Registered Architect can be sought.<\/p><p>The requirement for air cleaners in schools will depend on advices provided to schools by their Architect\/Engineer. As part of contingency planning, the Department has put arrangements in place (including at ETB level) for a small reserve of air cleaners to facilitate quick deployment to any primary or post-primary school which has an immediate need and has been unsuccessful in sourcing locally. <\/p><p>In conclusion my Departments approach on good ventilation in schools, as part of a layered strategy of protective measures to control the spread of the virus, is fully consistent with Public Health advice and  the Expert Group recommendations on good practices, the use of portable CO<sub>2<\/sub>monitors and the targeted deployment of HEPA air filter devices where necessary for poorly ventilated areas.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200088#WRF03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School

Since then my Department has taken a series of steps to implement these reforms, with a view to completing them by the end of 2024.\u00a0<\/p><p>A staff team has been established in my Department to\u00a0lead the\u00a0transition to the new model. Ending Direct Provision and putting in place the new system with its focus on human rights, on not-for-profit delivery, and on integration from day one, requires a whole-of-Government approach. My Department is therefore working closely with key stakeholders across Government to plan, design, and implement the changes described in the White Paper. <\/p><p>I have appointed a Programme Board, including officials from relevant Government Departments and agencies, and independent members, to oversee the transition. So far, the Board has met four times since its establishment, and its next meeting is scheduled for 16 December.<\/p><p>I have appointed a three-person External Advisory Group whose role is that of independent observer of the implementation of the new policy. Through its work, this Group will help to build confidence in the reform programme among all stakeholders. This Group has already met twice, most recently on 19 November. <\/p><p>As stated in the White Paper, my intention is to have the new system of supports and accommodation for international protection applicants operational by December 2024. \u00a0We have made good progress on this objective to date.\u00a0\u00a0Working with the Housing Agency, my\u00a0Department has begun to acquire the accommodation needed to implement the White Paper reforms. We are currently prioritising the acquisition of accommodation for Phase Two - that is, after people have completed their initial four months in a Reception and Integration Centre and move into the community. <\/p><p>We anticipate that the process of moving the first applicants into this accommodation will begin in 2022 and that it will accelerate over the following years as more properties come on stream.<\/p><p>Working with the housing experts on the Programme Board, my Department is\u00a0developing an\u00a0ownership model\u00a0for the accommodation, as well as a funding model to enable\u00a0Approved Housing Bodies and other not-for-profit organisations to act as our delivery partners. An allocation key to determine the spread of this accommodation across all counties has been agreed by Local Authorities.<\/p><p>With respect to integration, the House will be aware that the White Paper commits to the principle of 'integration from day one' for all international protection applicants. My Department is currently developing the detailed policy required to meet this commitment. This integration policy will enable applicants to live independently in Ireland and will help them to feel at home in their new communities. Integration supports will be delivered during both Phase One and Phase Two of the new model. <\/p><p>During Phase One, applicants will live in a Reception and Integration Centre, where they will participate in an Integration Programme including language tuition and\u00a0orientation to living in Ireland. In Phase Two, after four months, applicants will move to independent living in the community. <\/p><p>Here they will have access to integration supports\u00a0delivered by service providers at a local level through Interagency Working Groups co-ordinated by the relevant Local Authority. Applicants will also be assisted by a network of Integration Support Workers, who will help to link them in with the supports they need.<\/p><p>When living in the community, applicants will receive an International Protection Support Payment to enable them to meet their needs. A child payment will also be provided. As applicants now have access to the labour market after six months, support to access employment will also be provided. Detailed policy on the International Protection Support Payments is being developed by my Department. <\/p><p>It\u00a0will take time to end Direct Provision and replace it with a new and very different system of accommodation and supports - grounded in human rights and delivered on a not-for-profit basis.\u00a0 However, I am fully committed to implementing the model by December 2024.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200089#WRG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care and Education","counter":351,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200089#WRG05300"},{"type":"question","counter":352,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[59465\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200089#WRG05400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the status of the work of the Expert Group established in September 2019 to develop a new funding model for early learning and care and school age services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1519","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":353,"content":"<p>First 5, a whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families\u00a0commits to increasing investment in early learning and childcare to up to &euro;1 billion by 2028.

I am confident that the wide-ranging Action Plan for Survivors and Former Residents of Mother and Baby and County Home Institutions is fully inclusive and responds to the diverse needs of all those who are affected by the complex legacy of Mother and Baby Institutions. The actions are designed to support survivors in a number of ways into the future, as well as ensuring that what happened in the institutions is never forgotten, or repeated.<\/p><p>The Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme is Action number 20 in the Action Plan, and sits as\u00a0 one element of the entire redress package of supports and measures set out in that Plan.\u00a0Consultation\u00a0with survivors has clearly shown that they wanted the Scheme to be non-adversarial, simple and with a low burden of proof. Following extensive and challenging deliberations, I concluded that providing a general payment based on time spent in an institution, with no requirement to bring forward any evidence of abuse or harm, was the best way to ensure that the Scheme causes no further trauma.  This approach means that those who spent the longest time in these institutions, and therefore suffered most from the harsh institutional conditions, will receive the highest level of payment. <\/p><p>The proposals for the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme go well beyond the recommendations of the Commission of Investigation and also beyond the proposals of the Interdepartmental Group which was established to develop proposals for the Scheme.

Tusla assesses the information received and the child and family&rsquo;s situation, and provides appropriate social work intervention and family support services. Where necessary in the best interest of the child, children are received into the care of Tusla. <\/p>  <p>  Tusla has a dedicated Quality Assurance Team which produces monthly, quarterly and annual reports in respect of Tusla's functions, including detailed reporting on child safety and protection services. Most recent reports indicate that Tusla received 6,405 child protection and welfare referrals in September 2021, 748 (13%) more than August 2021 (5,657) and 294 (5%) more than September 2020 (6,111). The reports are published on Tusla's website and are scrutinised by my officials. Issues of note are brought to my attention. The reports provide statistical evidence of improvements to child welfare and protection services and highlight challenges and areas where further improvement is required, such as the recruitment of additional social workers. <\/p>  <p>  Additionally, Tusla child protection and welfare, and alternative care services are inspected against the relevant Standards and Regulations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspection reports are also published, and the findings used to inform the development and improvement of services within Tusla.  HIQA's most recent thematic report of 12 child protection services was positive, identifying improvements in governance and oversight by Tusla managers. The reports include many positive comments by parents and children of their experience with social workers and give examples of good practice and dedicated staff. However, some areas continue to identify challenges in maintaining a consistently high standard of service, often ascribed to the the impact of staffing shortages, and difficulties in finding appropriate placements for children and young people.<\/p>  <p>  Officials from my Department meet Tusla management on a regular basis to review the level of service provision, including areas in need of improvement. The recruitment and retention of social workers is a priority for Tusla, and in that regard there is a significant amount of work being done, both by Tusla and my officials, to increase the recruitment of social workers.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200091#WRJ00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"question","counter":428,"qnumday":145,"qnumall":"[59738\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200091#WRJ01000","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the total number of children currently in the various forms of care, institutional or otherwise; the degree to which he is satisfied with the level and quality of the case in all such situations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":429,"content":"<p>In relation to the figures requested by the Deputy, I am informed by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, that at the end of September 2021 there were 5,841 children in care.

In 2020 Tusla&rsquo;s Practice Assurance and Service Monitoring (PASM) team conducted a programme of 134 practice audits of Tusla child protection and welfare, alternative care and children's residential care services.

Its purpose is to promote and protect human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State. In mid-October 2020 the transfer took place of the Governance function of IHREC from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department. <\/p>  <p>  Significant advances have been made in recent years to address inequality in Irish society, with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to fostering a diverse, inclusive and equal society re-affirmed through the Programme for Government commitments to achieve social solidarity, equality of opportunity and economic equity for all.<\/p>  <p>  The suite of national equality strategies, overseen and coordinated by my Department, act as the central policy framework adopted by Government to address inequality across Irish society. The strategies include the Migrant Integration Strategy (MIS),\u00a0the National Strategy for Women and Girls (NSWG), the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy (NTRIS), the National Disability Inclusion Strategy (NDIS), the National LGBTI+ Inclusion Strategy, the National LGBTI+ Strategy for Youth and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities (CES).<\/p>  <p>  The implementation of each equality strategy is overseen by a steering committee which draws together State and non-State actors to deliver a better quality of life for all through targeted actions to promote social inclusion and improved access to public services. I chair the meetings of the committees charged with the monitoring and oversight of the strategies, with the exception of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy steering group which is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte T.D., and the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities which is chaired by Fergus Finlay.<\/p>  <p>  As some of these strategies near their conclusion, I will work with stakeholders to examine what has been achieved over their term and how we can bring forth the next iterations of those strategies and ensure they are even more robust and effective. <\/p>  <p>  In June of this year I announced my intention to conduct a review of the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts to examine the functioning of the Acts and their effectiveness in combatting discrimination and in promoting equality, including awareness of the legislation and whether there are obstacles to taking an action under the Acts.

The guidance, which was fully revised in October 2017 to include reference to the provisions of the Act, is intended to assist members of the public, professionals, employees or volunteers in identifying and reporting concerns about child abuse and neglect to Tusla.   <\/p>  <p>  - Tusla, the Child and Family Agency,\u00a0assesses all child welfare and protection concerns that are reported to it and takes appropriate action. If Tusla suspects that a crime has been committed and a child has been wilfully neglected or physically or sexually abused, it will formally notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without delay.  \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Tusla also\u00a0has a dedicated social work team for Separated Children Seeking International Protection (SCSIP). Over the past 20 years the SCSIP Team has developed expertise through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in International Refugee Protection Programmes and by caring for the greater number of separated children seeking international protection who arrive unannounced at Irish ports and airports. The majority of unaccompanied children arriving in Ireland are over 15 years old and need significant educational, language and, in many instances, therapeutic supports. The on-going social work assessment is multi-disciplinary in nature and involves a medical examination, an educational assessment and a child protection risk assessment. A statutory care plan is developed and, if appropriate, an application for asylum is made on behalf of the child. After assessment, children are placed in the most appropriate placement option depending on their assessed needs. In 2020, Tusla received 80 referrals for Separated Children Seeking International Protection and of that number 51 children were received into the statutory\u00a0care of Tusla.  <\/p>  <p>  - In February 2021, my Department\u00a0published A White Paper to End Direct Provision and to Establish a New International Protection Support Service. This White Paper outlines the proposed new system of accommodation and supports that will be offered to applicants for International Protection and is the result of an extensive consultation process with Civil Society Organisations, residents of Direct Provision centres, and other Government Departments and Bodies.\u00a0   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The new system is based on a series of principles which is centred on a Human Rights approach with a focus on dignity, respect and privacy for all. There will be a particular focus on vulnerable applicants including victims of trafficking. This focus includes providing specific accommodation for both female and male victims of trafficking and ensuring all appropriate health and social care supports are available.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200091#WRJ03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Domestic Violence","counter":451,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200091#WRJ03300"},{"type":"question","counter":452,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[59747\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200091#WRJ03400","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"the extent to which his Department has noted various experiences of women and children who may be under threat from domestic, sexual and gender-based violence including those in the care of the State and or by orders of courts; his plans to address this issue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":453,"content":"<p>Domestic\u00a0sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) is a stain on\u00a0society.\u00a0I am determined to work with Government colleagues on our commitment to\u00a0address this issue. <\/p><p>The Minister for Justice is co-ordinating the development of the Third National Strategy on DSGBV which will have a greater focus on prevention.

Children First provides a strong statutory framework for reporting concerns that a child might be at risk of abuse or neglect. Tusla works closely with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in responding to reported concerns, including those relating to women and children at risk from DSGBV.<\/p><p>Tusla has a statutory role to support victims of DSGBV. Tusla funds 60 organisations that deliver services for these victims, including\u00a021 services that provide emergency refuge and non-refuge accommodation. Other funded organisations provide community-based domestic violence services and rape crisis services.\u00a0In 2021,\u00a0Tusla's funding of DSGBV services amounted to\u00a0&euro;28 million, with an additional &euro;2 million of one-off contingency funding being made available to help services cope with the ongoing effects of COVID-19. <\/p><p>My Department has provided once off funding in 2021 under the &quot;What Works&quot; initiative to organisations for projects and programmes to support children and adults affected by DSGBV.

In a recent\u00a0report titled 'Ripe for Reform', which was commissioned by my Department, amongst other themes, the report considered the impact of domestic violence and domestic homicide on those children subject to child care proceedings. These findings, and other recommendations in the report, span the remit of a number of Government Departments. For example,\u00a0the authors highlight concerns in respect of guardianship matters in cases where one parent kills the other. In such cases the surviving parent is the sole remaining legal guardian until a full care order is made.\u00a0I will ensure that the report is brought to the attention of the relevant authorities, and will follow up as required.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>Tusla carefully monitors all\u00a0referrals to the Agency. The risk of DSGBV may not be evident at the time of referral and is not easily captured as a statistic.\u00a0The most recently available data shows a rise in the proportion of all child protection and welfare referrals relating to emotional abuse. Looking to annual trends (Table 1), emotional abuse increased from\u00a033% of all child protection referrals, in 2014 to 43% in 2020, and is\u00a0notably the largest proportion of all four abuse types.

The survey provides information on alcohol, tobacco, and drug use amongst the general population in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The survey findings show that, overall, the use of illegal drugs has remained at a similar level to that recorded in the 2014\/15 survey, while an increase was seen in the use of cocaine and ecstasy. Cannabis, while being the most prevalent illegal drug in Ireland, has also shown a decrease from 6.5% to 5.9% when compared to the 2014\/15 survey. A significant decrease in the instances of Cannabis Use Disorder has also been recorded.<\/p>  <p>  Our national drug strategy recognises the need to strengthen early harm reduction responses to current and emerging trends and patterns of drug use. The recently completed mid-term review of the strategy shows significant progress in implementing the action plan for the period 2017 to 2020, with only a small number of the 50 actions outstanding. Access and availability of drug services have been improved, particularly services for women, people who are homeless, and those with heroin addiction. A new clinical programme for dual diagnosis has been developed and the Government is championing an alternative health-led approach for the possession of drugs for personal use. <\/p>  <p>  As part of the mid-term review six strategic priorities have been identified for the remaining years of the strategy until 2025. These will strengthen the health-led approach to drug use, as agreed in the Programme for Government, and align with the EU Drugs Strategy and Action Plan. <\/p>  <p>  These priorities will protect children and young people from drug use and the associated harms and enhance community care for people who use drugs by providing health and social care services at the community level to meet identified health needs.  <\/p>  <p>  To support the implementation of the strategic priorities, I provided additional funding of &euro;6m for new health measures in Budget 2022.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200092#WRL05575","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"question","counter":513,"qnumday":174,"qnumall":"[55908\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200092#WRL05700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he has received a business proposal for the new elective hospital in County Cork; and if not, when he expects to receive same.","asker":"1453","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":514,"content":"<p>The provision of additional elective care delivery capability in Cork, Galway, and Dublin is a stated Government policy objective.<\/p>  <p>  The Elective Hospitals Oversight Group, under the joint governance of the HSE, Department of Health and Sl&aacute;intecare, is guiding the development of the elective hospitals.

While significant progress was made in reducing waiting times from June 2020 onwards, the surge in Covid-19 cases in the first quarter of 2021 and the associated curtailment of acute hospital services, coupled with the ransomware attack of May 2021, has impacted waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  The current surge in Covid-19 cases has put increasing pressures on hospitals and ICUs. As part of the response to this the HSE advised all Hospital Groups on 18th November, to take a series of immediate actions which include a 14 day period of prioritising unscheduled care, COVID care and time sensitive work in particular in Model 4 hospitals. The situation is to be reviewed after that period.<\/p>  <p>  On the 7th October I published the Acute Waiting List Action Plan. This plan, to run until December 2021, has a series of targeted measures that are designed to address the growth in waiting lists caused by Covid-19 and the cyber-attack. In addition, my Department, the HSE and the NTPF are also working on a Multi Annual Waiting List Plan to bring waiting lists in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets over the coming years. This process will be overseen by a Ministerial Taskforce, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and includes representatives from the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund. The plan will be informed by the lessons learned from the successful Vaccine Taskforce.<\/p>  <p>  In recent years, my Department has worked with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to improve access for patients waiting for high volume procedures, including cataracts. Ophthalmology services are provided throughout all hospital groups in the country, with cataract removal one of the key procedures carried out as part of this specialty.<\/p>  <p>  A key development in improving access to Ophthalmology services was the opening of a stand-alone high-volume consultant-led cataract theatre by the University of Limerick Hospital Group in Nenagh Hospital in 2018, with the intention that it would facilitate patients from surrounding geographical areas to avail of their treatment there. The impact of such initiatives can be seen in the reduction in the waiting times to access cataract procedures since 2018. At the end of October 2021 there were 4,717 patients waiting for a cataract procedure compared to 6,452 in October 2018.<\/p>  <p>  For 2022 an additional allocation of &euro;250 million, comprised of &euro;200 million to the HSE and &euro;50 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund has been provided in respect of work to reduce hospital and community waiting lists. The &euro;250 million will be used to fund additional activity in both the public and private sectors. The &euro;50 million additional funding provided to the NTPF brings its total allocation for 2022 to &euro;150 million, and as a consequence there will be a budget of &euro;350 million available to support vital initiatives to improve access to acute hospitals and community health services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to the particular queries raised, regarding where surgery is available for the removal of cataracts and the number of procedures that have taken place in the last twelve months, as these are service matters, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the Deputy directly, as soon as possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200095#WRO06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Maternity Hospital","counter":713,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP00200"},{"type":"question","counter":714,"qnumday":242,"qnumall":"[59760\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the progress to date in advancing the proposed new maternity hospital; the extent to which agreement has been reached to the satisfaction of all parties while meeting any concerns the general public might have; if all outstanding matters have been satisfactorily resolved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1584","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":715,"content":"<p>The Government is committed to the development of the new National Maternity Hospital (NMH) planned for the St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital Campus at Elm Park, as set out in the Programme for Government.<\/p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new National Maternity Hospital were set out in the Mulvey Agreement, which provides for the establishment of a new company - National Maternity Hospital at Elm Park DAC - which will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary independence in the provision of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services.<\/p><p>The draft legal framework that has been developed is designed to copperfasten these arrangements and to ensure protection of the State&rsquo;s investment.

This will enable all stakeholders make the necessary business and\/or infrastructural adjustments that will ensure compliance with the Regulations. <\/p><p>The move has been well received by all stakeholders and I thank all of them for their continued positive engagement in the matter. <\/p><p>While the new National Veterinary Prescription System (NVPS) will be in place as planned for the end of January, its mandatory use will also be delayed until 1st\u00a0June to allow for a smooth transition to compliance. for this same period.<\/p><p>The new veterinary medicines regulations are focused on ensuring increased availability of veterinary medicines across the EU, as well as addressing the key societal One Health One Welfare challenges of anti-microbial resistance, as well as anti-parasitic resistance.<\/p><p>The roadmap is as follows:<\/p><p>1. The Regulations come into effect on 28<sup>th<\/sup>January.\u00a0<\/p><p>2. The new requirements regarding the prescribing of antimicrobials, including antibiotics, \u00a0and medicated feed, will come into effect on that date.<\/p><p>3. The requirement to only supply anti-parasitic medicines on foot of a veterinary prescription is deferred for a four-month period &ndash; until 1<sup>st<\/sup>June 2022. A prescription will not be required for such products until that date.<\/p><p>4. The national mandatory requirement to use the NVPS is deferred until 1<sup>st<\/sup>June 2022. Veterinary practitioners can continue to issue paper-based prescriptions in the current format until then.<\/p><p>5. The NVPS will be available for voluntary use by vets from the end of January onwards &ndash; to ensure that prescribers and dispensers are familiar with the system when its use becomes compulsory.<\/p><p>6. Prescriptions issued by vets for anti-parasitic medicines after 1<sup>st<\/sup>June will be valid for a maximum period of 12-months. Antiparasitic medicines can then be purchased by the farmer from his or her preferred supplier at the appropriate time throughout the period that the prescription is valid.<\/p><p>7. From 1<sup>st<\/sup>June 2022, the Regulations will be applied in full.<\/p><p>I have asked my officials to explore the issue of interchangeable anti-parasitics, and more information will be available on this in the coming weeks. I have made these amendments to help farmers, vets, pharmacists and licensed merchants transition to the new regulations.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Expenditure","counter":734,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02300"},{"type":"question","counter":735,"qnumday":249,"qnumall":"[59696\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the amount expended by his Department in each of the past five years to date in 2021 on lighting and heating costs in tabular form.","asker":"1489","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":736,"content":"<p>The amount expended by my Department in each of the past five years to date in 2021 on lighting and heating costs in tabular form is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Expenditure*<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2017 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,790,840 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2018 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,861,412 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,655,066 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>&euro;2,744,297 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 (to 29.11.2021)<\/td>       <td>&euro;2,728,869 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>*Due to the method of recording data, some vehicular fuel costs have been included in the expenditure amounts above.\u00a0Costs reimbursed or recouped from other Government Departments sharing facilities have been accounted for.<\/p><p>Some of our buildings are heated by electricity and as such we are unable to provide an accurate split between heating and lighting costs.\u00a0<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Properties","counter":737,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02600"},{"type":"question","counter":738,"qnumday":250,"qnumall":"[59714\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021120200096#WRP02700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the steps he has taken to improve ventilation in the office buildings of his Department;
