The report was laid before the Oireachtas.  It shows there has been strong recruitment since 2011 to the estimated 237 recruitment grades across the public service, with more than 60,500 new entrants hired or just under one fifth of the public service.

Therefore, meeting the fiscal rules underpins our objective of being careful with the national finances.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of facilitating greater flexibility within the application of the fiscal rules has received a significant focus at European level and framed discussions on the establishment of structural and investment clauses which were codified by the European Commission in November 2015.

Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, there is existing flexibility within the expenditure benchmark whereby capital increases are smoothed over four years, with the result that only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded from the first year within the fiscal space.  This provision which means increases in capital spending for housing and other purposes can be front-loaded within EU rules and has been availed of in our plan.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy should also be aware that any decision to increase capital expenditure over and above already planned levels would need to balance the danger of potential overheating in the economy with the need to address infrastructural priorities and risks such as Brexit.

Following the identification of these invasive species within the site in 2015, a detailed survey was carried out to ascertain the full extent of the problem and to enable a management plan and treatment programme to be put in place.  Treatment, which involves the controlled application of an approved herbicide, was carried out in 2016 and 2017.  During 2018, the treatment of Japanese knotweed will take place in April and September and the treatment of Himalayan balsam will be carried out in July this year.  Further advance construction elements involve relocation of services and utilities along the promenade are expected to commence in 2018.<\/p> <p> The scheme design and environmental impact assessment report and other relevant reports will be made available to the public through the statutory exhibition process.  Following this, submissions received will be assessed and designs may be amended as a result.  Subsequently, formal confirmation or approval for the scheme will be sought from the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform, with construction expected to start in mid to late 2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200007#E02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1363","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521717600,"counter":89,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for being bang on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200008#F00200","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1521717600,"counter":90,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.

Thankfully it did not, but it needs to progress as quickly as possible.  I thank the Acting Chair, Deputy Eugene Murphy, who has also brought this matter up.  This has been let slip for two years and it cannot be allowed to slip any further.  Enniscorthy is very vulnerable to flooding.

The current programmes have a combined value of &euro;550 million in the period 2014 to 2020, of which 85% is being funded through the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to the successful implementation of the current programmes, but more than that, we are committed to successor programmes post-2020.  The PEACE and INTERREG programmes are important drivers of regional development in a cross-Border context.  Through EU-funded co-operation, a range of Departments and agencies, North and South, have engaged in and benefited from a variety of cross-Border and cross-community projects.  Support for the two programmes from the ERDF is not only an important source of funding but also a key element of the European Union's continuing commitment to the process of peace building and reconciliation in the region in the last quarter of a century.  I was delighted, therefore, when December's agreed progress report between the European Union and the United Kingdom included a specific paragraph which reflected the Government's ambition to complete the current programmes and examine favourably the possibilities for future programmes.  In its communication to the European Council that accompanied the progress report the European Commission commitsed itself to proposing the continuation of the programmes in its proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework, which is expected in May.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200010#H00600","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1521718800,"counter":126,"content":"<p>The four Deputies will have an opportunity to put two supplementary questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200010#H00700","speaker":"1342"},{"type":"speech","time":1521718800,"counter":127,"content":"<p>Will the Minister say what plans have been made to improve the investments in ports, particularly Dublin, Rosslare and Cork, over and beyond what is contained in the Ireland 2040 document?

In terms of from where funding will come to allow their development, it will come in one of two ways.  Most of it will come from the resources available to ports, but, obviously, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport now has a five-year capital allocation to support important capital projects.  Within the five-year window additional support could be made available to make progress on really important projects.<\/p>  <p>  To respond to the questions put to me by Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Carol Nolan on whether it is feasible to broaden the current range of priorities for funding, it is unlikely to happen because we have agreed to the projects and the funding stream for the current European Union programmes.  We had to place a lot of attention on making sure the commitments we had made would be implemented.  That was a real priority of mine in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum result.  It is unlikely that we will change the breadth of programmes or projects at this point.  Where I am placing the majority of the focus of my Department is on what will take place.

The Deputy asks about low pay and whether this is resulting in staff shortages, particularly in health and education.  It seems to be popular in some quarters to assert that the public service no longer represents an attractive career option, that there is a crisis in recruitment and a continuing focus on the difficulties within the public service.<\/p>  <p>  My concern is that much of this can be counterproductive.  The truth is that the public service is a good employer by any objective measurement.  Public service offers a comprehensive set of terms and conditions, flexible working arrangements, decent pension provisions, fair wages that increase over time and secure employment.  While public service is a career choice, and people who serve are highly motivated by the public good, the competitiveness of the package on offer can be seen in the strong level of recruitment that this report has highlighted. <\/p>  <p>  Headline public service numbers already show a high level of recruitment of over 29,000 since 2013.  However, this is the growth in the overall public service and as such it does not capture recruitment \"below the line\", replacing retirements and leavers. <\/p>  <p>  The report I submitted last Friday, however, sheds light on this, revealing that over 60,500 people have been recruited in the \"new entrant\" grades since 2011.

As of this week there is a collective agreement for three years that virtually all unions or representative bodies in this country are either in or associated with.

However, it was not.  That is a reflection on the professionalism of our emergency services and first responders.  Today, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the scene cordoned off.  There will be an extensive investigation to understand what happened.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien has done, I thank those involved for their professionalism.  We will come back to this issue when we have more clarity on what happened and on why and how it unfolded.<\/p>  <p>  On the passports issue, the service has been under pressure, in particular over the last two weeks.  A number of Members know that because they have come to me about individual cases.  We have tried to put extra resources into my office over the last number of weeks to try to deal with that.  We anticipate increased numbers this year on last year in respect of passport applications and renewals.  Last year there was a big increase on the year before.  There is a big demand for Irish passports now.  The real problem in recent weeks was actually the extreme weather.<\/p>  <p>  We had to close services down because staff could not get into the passport office for a number of days.  As a result, our passport teams worked over the bank holiday when other people were not working in an effort to try to catch up and get back to the turnaround times we created last year which were a significant improvement on the past.  Whether it is online or post applications, we are endeavouring, with some success, to get back to where we were in January and the back end of last year in respect of getting turnaround times down to roughly three weeks for the postal service and two weeks for an online application.<\/p>  <p>  However, that is taking some time.  This week online applications are back to the acceptable benchmark.  We are working overtime to make sure we get back to that from a postal service perspective as well.

We know bad weather events and Storm Emma occurred.  It shows that the system is not robust.

The reality is that resourcing within the service has been decreased year-on-year.  In 2012, there were 306 full-time staff in the service.  In 2016, there were 269.  There was a 12% reduction.

It is thanks to them, the Garda and other emergency and council staff, as well as the staff of the hotel and the adjoining building, that there were neither injuries nor fatalities.  They deserve all of our thanks.<\/p>  <p>  This day two months ago, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, announced his affordable homes initiative.  Describing the measures as initiatives was a bit of a stretch.  They were more like threadbare promises.  He re-announced the &euro;25 million fund for local authorities to deliver affordable homes but there were no details, no timelines and certainly no targets.  He re-announced the long-promised but not yet delivered cost rental project.  Again, there were no details, no timelines and certainly no targets.  The only concrete proposal was for a revised local authority first-time buyer's loan scheme.  Clearly, the Minister was under pressure.  He needed to give the impression that he was doing something.  That was because on Fine Gael's watch, the affordable housing crisis has spiralled out of control.<\/p>  <p>  Thousands, if not tens of thousands, of individuals and couples are unable to access affordable homes to rent or to buy.  The Government's housing plan has no targets for the delivery of affordable homes.  The Minister, possibly with the overpriced advice of the strategic communications unit, cobbled together the so-called initiative to make it look like he had a plan.  In response to the revised council loan scheme, Sinn F&eacute;in raised the following concerns.  It did not address the core problem, namely, the undersupply of affordable housing.  It risked burdening modest-income families with unsustainable loans to purchase overpriced houses.  It breached the Central Bank's mortgage lending rules.  While the scheme will help some families and the fixed-interest rate is attractive, it demonstrates the Government has not yet grasped the scale, or indeed the source, of the affordable housing crisis.<\/p>  <p>  When I made these points at the time, the Minister dismissed my concerns.  However, this morning, RT&Eacute; reporter, Louise Byrne, revealed on \"Morning Ireland\" that the Department of Finance shared exactly the same concerns.  In a written response to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance said the rationale for the measure was unclear, it involved significant risk of exposure to the State and would do nothing to increase housing supply at a time when supply not demand was the problem.  Despite this, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, ignored these concerns.  The information obtained by RT&Eacute; also revealed that, even though its concerns were not met, the Department of Finance withdrew its objections, leading to speculation that the final decision was a political one, made in full knowledge of the shortcomings and problems with the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell the House why the Government ignored the opinion of the Department of Finance?  Will he tell us why Rebuilding Ireland contains no targets for affordable rental or purchase homes?  Will he confirm that not a single affordable home will be delivered this year by any central government scheme?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200013#L01700","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1521720600,"counter":187,"content":"<p>As usual, the Deputy sees conspiracies around every corner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200013#L01800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1521720600,"counter":188,"content":"<p>It is hard not to when the T&aacute;naiste is in charge.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200013#L01900","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1521720600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme was a measure which was discussed between the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Finance, as any scheme would be when significant moneys are involved.

The truth is that at the end of that discussion, the two Departments agreed to move forward with it.  That is what the record shows.  Is anybody who has been in government surprised by the fact that initially the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would raise robust questions to test the merits of this approach?  There is always a robust exchange when the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a new idea and asks it what it thinks.  At the end of that, there is an agreement on a way forward which is what happened in this case.<\/p>  <p>  It is a success story so far.

There will be an opportunity for us to look in detail at the lessons to be learned about evacuation procedures and so on, but they worked well last night and nobody was injured or died, which is an incredible tribute to the emergency services.  It is important the House acknowledge that.<\/p><p>There was a landmark decision yesterday at the Workplace Relations Commission when the national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, was found to have discriminated against a former employee, Ms Valerie Cox, on age grounds and ordered to pay her &euro;50,000.  The reason she took the case was concerns about ageism in employment.  As people, thankfully, are living longer and healthier lives, many will want to look work longer.  The age of retirement in qualification for the State pension has risen to 66 years and will rise again.  However, many employment contracts provide for compulsory retirement when a person reaches the age of 65 years, as a consequence of which many older people will find themselves on temporary or uncertain contracts if they continue to work after that age.  We have seen the creeping rise in the level of precarious work and it is essential that it be tackled for all workers in order that older workers who wish to continue to work beyond the age of 65 years will not be exploited.  We will see more and more such cases.  My former colleague Anne Ferris introduced a Bill in the D&aacute;il in 2014 to bring to an end the compulsory retirement age in the public service.  The Government is catching up and plans to address the issue with legislation, the heads of which were approved in December.  There are many working in the public sector who, for many reasons, do not wish to retire at 65 years and who are more than capable of continuing to be valuable public servants and make a contribution for years to come.  The public service is growing and recruiting again and important institutional knowledge should be retained.  It will provide important benefits for our society as the population ages if older people can continue, if they so choose and it their wish, to work.  It is important to stress that it would be voluntary.  The legislation should be progressed as quickly as possible to provide certainty for those workers who are approaching the compulsory retirement age.  Many are anxious and contacting all of us in the House.  The current arrangements which are being implemented on an interim <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, pending the passage of legislation, are neither attractive nor rewarding.  I have two questions.  When will the Government publish the legislation to abolish the mandatory retirement age for public sector workers?  Will the legislation also end the use of compulsory or mandatory retirement provisions in the contract of workers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200014#M00500","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1521721200,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Like the Deputy, I welcome the judgment of the Workplace Relations Commission and hope it sends a signal to the many people who find themselves in similar circumstances to Ms Valerie Cox.  As the Deputy noted, the Government has agreed to increase the compulsory retirement age from 65 years to 70 for public servants who were recruited before 1 April 2004.  It has also approved the scheme of a Bill to give effect to this policy change which is now to be treated as a priority.  The Attorney General has requested the prioritising of the drafting of the legislation in order that the new compulsory retirement age will become effective as soon as possible.  The drafting process is under way and an initial draft Bill is being prepared.  The Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the spring-summer session.  It is not possible to determine the length of time it will take for it to be drafted and passed through both Houses, given the need for meticulous drafting, ongoing detailed policy considerations and the scheduling requirements of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  However, as the Deputy noted, the Government has approved interim arrangements which will apply to public servants who reach the age of 65 years in the time between the Government decision and the commencement of the necessary legislation.  I accept that is not ideal.  People have come to me, as I suspect they have to the Deputy, who are coming up to the age threshold.  We need to get on and deal with the legislation quickly.  We appeal to other parties in the House to help us to do this quickly.  It is a priority to turn what is a clear policy decision, with which I think everybody agrees, into legislation to bring clarity in order that people will not have to rely on what are not perfect interim measures but which are necessary to carry us over until the legislation is concluded.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200014#M00600","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1521721200,"counter":235,"content":"<p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for the clarity of his response.  It is a view that is shared broadly across the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also introduced legislation in this area, which I acknowledge.  In truth, there are people who will miss the deadline and be forced out.  Can we not have consensus that the legislation will be introduced this side of the summer recess and implemented with goodwill across the House?  The Workplace Relations Commission has published a code of practice on the issue of longer working which is to inform best practice for employers.  However, a code of practice is not enough; it will need legislative underpinning.  Certainly, for those who are anxious, for example, those who might be in second relationships, have longer term mortgages or financial commitments about which they are very anxious, and capable of working for many years to come, they should not be forced out the door.  I dealt recently with one case in which a driving instructor simply wanted to continue to work.  Although there is a huge backlog and we are still trying to recruit and train driving instructors, he was forced out the door.  That policy makes no sense.  It should not be mandatory for the State and its agencies to push people out the door when they want to continue to work and are capable of working and the State needs their services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200014#M00700","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1521721200,"counter":236,"content":"<p>We all know former civil servants in their late 60s who would be well capable of doing a really good job, but we are losing their expertise, knowledge and experience at a time when there is competition for skill sets in the economy and it is sometimes difficult to fill posts with persons with the skill sets we need.  This is the right thing to do on many levels.  It arises in a context where people want to work longer and have the capacity to do so, are healthy for longer and the State needs their services.  In so many areas, because we can afford to do so, we are increasing numbers in the public sector.  My Department is a good example in that we are dramatically increasing numbers in expanding our global footprint, opening new embassies and so on.  We want people to stay longer and need to get legislation in place as quickly as possible to underpin that decision.

The elderly built this country.  Now, when they need help from the State, they have to fight every inch of the way to receive care.  Proof of this is the way the Government stands idly by as hundreds of the elderly are forced to travel to Belfast for cataract operations.  For them, it is simply a case of travel Belfast or go blind.  That is just one issue.  Elder care services needs to be scrutinised by all of us in the D&aacute;il.  Years of empty promises have yielded nothing.  The home help service being delivered is as bad as it was two years ago when I first raised the issue with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who said the Government would turn things around.  Home helps go beyond the call of duty, but the joy they get from their jobs is diminishing quickly as visits are cut to 30 and 45 minutes, which means that they are in and out the door, thus preventing them from providing the necessary care and giving the eldery person the attention and respect he or she deserves.  In many cases, home helps who have voluntarily done hours of extra work for the person receiving the service are being refused extra hours by the HSE, while it funds many private companies with questionable guidelines which have taken on staff from all over the world.<\/p><p>In the programme for Government, it was recognised that home help should be increased to seven days per week to include weekends and bank holidays where possible.  According to what families have been telling me, though, that is not the reality in my constituency.  Many elderly people have been forced into long-term care and put through the so-called fair deal scheme, which robs them of their savings, homes and, in many cases, burial money.<\/p> <p> More than 55,000 people have been diagnosed with dementia, 4,000 of whom are in County Cork.  Many of these are looked after in their own homes by members of their families.  There are a number of Alzheimer's patients whose behaviour is challenging, but neither the community hospitals nor nursing homes have the staffing or resources to provide respite care for them, leaving exhausted families to care for them.  There are only two dedicated respite beds for these challenging patients in the entire of west Cork, those being in Clonakilty Community Hospital, which can largely only service the Clonakilty area.  West Cork has the largest elderly population, as shown in the census statistics.<\/p> <p> I call on the T&aacute;naiste to set in motion immediately a study to provide extra respite beds in community hospitals and nursing homes across west Cork for patients with dementia.  I also call on him to instruct the HSE to start investing proper resources in the excellent home help service that is in place on the ground and whose carers have saved the State millions of euro over the years with little thanks.  He should examine the issue of the respite service for the elderly in west Cork, which has been non-existent in many cases.  Elderly care in west Cork leaves much to be desired.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200014#M00900","speaker":"1263","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521721800,"counter":239,"content":"<p>There were a lot of questions there, so let me try to revert with answers on some of them.

She has been trying in recent weeks to get long-term care for her loved one, but no beds are available.  In Skibbereen, another person who is desperately seeking respite care for a family member with dementia has been unable to do so, as community hospitals are not equipped to take such patients.  An elderly lady who looks after two elderly family members in their homes in Skibbereen and Bantry needs extra home help for just one day per week to go shopping, but she has been refused it.  The stunning new Bandon Community Hospital opened just a few short weeks ago, but while those essential works were under way for up to a year and a half, the family of a lady of 90 years of age could not get respite care.

It will provide clear guidance to the HSE over the appropriate usage of health technology assessment guidelines when assessing an orphan drug as well as establish a new criterion for the HSE to consider when making a relevant decision.<\/p><p>The provisions of the Bill are set out under four sections.  Section 1 sets out to define the term &quot;orphan medicinal product&quot; while section 2 inserts same into the principal Act.<\/p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The definition used is that set out in Regulation No. 141\/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1999 on orphan medicinal products.<\/p> <p> Section 3 amends section 19 of the principal Act.  Section 19(5) of the principal Act deals with the HSE's decision-making process in adding medicinal items to the reimbursement list and establishes that the HSE shall have regard to any health technology assessment, HTA, guidelines published by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that appear to the executive to be relevant to the relevant decision.  Currently, the HSE does differentiate an orphan medicinal product from other medicines in assessing the cost-effectiveness of a medicine in respect of which reimbursement is sought.  Currently, HTA places a heavy emphasis on fixed thresholds on the financial value of the volume and quality of increased life expectancy a treatment provides, in other words, the quality-adjusted life years assessment.  Threshold incremental cost-effective ratios disadvantage orphan medicinal products due to the often low availability of quantitative data as, by definition, a rare disease affects only a small number of patients while orphan medicinal products treat life-threatening or chronically debilitating diseases, meaning the improvements in health outcomes will be proportional to the severity of the patient population.  Section 3 amends subsection (5) to qualify that for the avoidance of doubt, HIQA guidelines that include a threshold incremental cost-effective ratio or similar assessment shall not be considered relevant when considering an orphan medicinal product for reimbursement.<\/p> <p> Section 4 amends section 3 of the principal Act.  The principal Act sets out criteria under Schedule 3 against which all medicines must be considered by the HSE when making a relevant reimbursement decision.  Part 3 of the Schedule contains several criteria in respect of which orphan medicinal products are particularly unfairly disadvantaged given their typically low patient population profile, high individual cost and low budgetary impact.  Accordingly, section 4 establishes a new set of criteria for consideration of orphan medicinal products mitigating against low qualitative data and guaranteeing that the HSE will consider qualitative data presenting on an orphan medicinal product for patients, clinicians and others.  Section 4 also aims to tackle inequality of treatment for patients with rare diseases by legislating for consideration of unmet need and for the availability of same treatment elsewhere in the EU.  Additionally, section 4 would require the HSE to consider the level of certainty provided via risk sharing commercial agreements with the manufacturer of an orphan medicinal product.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200017#P03100","speaker":"1321","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521723600,"counter":316,"content":"<p>Is the Bill opposed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200018#Q00200","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1521723600,"counter":317,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200018#Q00300","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521723600,"counter":318,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1521723600,"counter":319,"content":"<p>Since this is a Private Members' Bill, Second Stage must, under Standing Orders, be taken in Private Members' time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200018#Q00500","speaker":"1289"},{"type":"speech","time":1521723600,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200018#Q00600","speaker":"1321"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521723600,"counter":321,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Strategic Communications Unit: Motion (Resumed) [Private Members]","time":1521723600,"counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200018#Q00800"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1521723600,"counter":323,"content":"<p>The following motion was moved by Deputy Pearse Doherty on Tuesday, 20 March 2018:<\/p><p><\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1521723600,"counter":324,"content":"<p>I must now deal with a postponed division relating to the motion re disbandment of the strategic communications unit.

I have raised it before as a Topical Issue matter and in a huge number of parliamentary questions over a long period.<\/p>  <p>  The amalgamation of the schools in Kanturk is a long-running issue and has met huge obstacles and difficulties.  It is an amalgamation of two fantastic schools - the boys' school and the girls' school in Kanturk.  It was first mooted a long time ago when issues such as the procurement of the site, access to the site and planning permissions were considered.  There have been many obstacles.  I want an outline from the Minister and the Department of Education and Skills on the roadmap as we go forward for the jigsaw involving the local authority, land acquisition, trying to secure planning and the acquisition of the property.  At one stage the Department appealed the decision.  It was the first time an applicant appealed a decision to the board as a result of issues surrounding it.  There is huge frustration with the project within the school community in Kanturk and the wider community there.  Many people I meet have given up completely on expecting it to progress.  While a flag has been raised that the new school has been sanctioned, the official sanction was given in 2010 or 2011 and it had been sanctioned even before that.  It has gone through a very protracted process.<\/p>  <p>  Will the Minister put the exact process before the D&aacute;il?  Where do we go from here?  How far away are we from tender documents going out?  How far away are we from actually making sure the project will start and go to construction?  When does the Department envisage the school will be open for students?  Many dates have been given over recent years, which is hugely frustrating for the boards of management and the communities involved.  Of all the projects, there have been more representations made by me and other public representatives down through the years to try to get this up and running.<\/p>  <p>  Now is the time.  I understand the money was sanctioned a long time ago but where do we go from here?  When do the Department and Minister believe the project will commence?  There was no mention of it in any of the capital plan announcements.  There is a bit of scepticism about how we go forward.  What is the position?  When will it go to tender?  When do the Minister and his Department believe construction will start?  When does the Minister believe the school will be completed for pupils, staff and the entire community of Kanturk to move into the long-awaited new school?  We will start with those questions and I may have some supplementary questions for the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200021#W00300","speaker":"1283"},{"type":"speech","time":1521725100,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Moynihan for raising the issue.  It is an issue of considerable concern.  I have spoken to the Deputy's constituency colleagues, including the Minister, Deputy Creed, and others, who share his frustration.  I understand it.  It has a very long history.  The planning process started way back in 2012 at which point planning permission was refused by Cork County Council on the ground of access.  It then came up with an alternative approach to access and alternative site access proposals.  They were granted but subject to conditions that, as Deputy Moynihan has said, the Department felt could be leaving them exposed to building a school that would not have adequate access and could not open.  Based on the conditions, the Department instructed the Office of Public Works, OPW, to appeal the conditions to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but they were upheld so the Department had to proceed.  That has added complexity to the project.<\/p><p> I understand the project has been delayed in more recent times due to issues concerning clarification of the ownership of the lands adjacent to the site and on a number of sides, the passing of some of that land into county council ownership, and the acquisition of licences that are required to carry out the necessary enabling works for the project.  I gather the issue was related to building an access road and footpath which were required due to the new condition.<\/p> <p> I am pleased to note that the issue around the land passing into county council ownership has been resolved and a licence has been received from the county council to allow the necessary electrical cable enabling works on that land to proceed.  This development permitted the OPW to agree a design with the ESB for the works and the OPW is now proceeding to tender for them.  I gather that that element of the works could take up to nine months as it involves groundworks and overhead diversion works, all of which must be completed.  A further licence from another landowner to allow foul sewer works during the building project has progressed and is now being finalised.

As we all know, public consultation is one of the most important activities both national and local government and State agencies can undertake.  By consulting effectively with the citizen and stakeholders we improve on the making of policy and its implementation.  It is essential that public consultation is done in a very accurate way as it is so important that we get it right.  The consultation process increases transparency and improves engagement with the people.  The information gleaned from public consultations means that policy is more informed and accurate and that, if changes are to be made, citizens are more aware of them.<\/p><p>In recent years, both locally and nationally, various types of public consultation have been carried out.  For example, at local level, when local area plans are being carried out, a local authority must try to communicate with the local citizenry that it will happen and try to reach people in as many ways as possible.  A similar process is undertaken for the county development plan.<\/p><p>Currently, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is doing a consultation on the disability allowance payment and other schemes in terms of whether they should be reconfigured and how.  The question is who knows about that.  A person might be unaware of the situation unless he or she is a member of an advocacy group.  The consultation is taking place on the <i>welfare.ie<\/i>website and unless a person is affected directly, he or she might not know about it although what that person might have to say is valuable.  To participate in a meaningful way, a person would have to make a submission him or herself or have someone do so on his or her behalf.  However, the only way that person can make a submission is to know about it in the first place.<\/p><p>My proposal is that for the citizen to understand and access public consultation, we should have a single access portal on the Internet.  Each county could have a separate access point showing both local and national consultations.  For example, in my area if I click on County Offaly, I could see what consultations are being carried out by the local authority but I could also see what the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Arts Council or F&aacute;ilte Ireland are doing at a national level.  Therefore, I could make a submission on a particular issue if I so wished.  At the moment I believe reaching the citizen is very piecemeal.  Given how technology is moving, it must be possible for us to have a single online portal for public consultation that would allow people to look at their local area, region or nationally and see what is relevant to them.  Currently, I do not believe we are not getting good quality, all-encompassing information.  We must take a targeted approach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200022#X00600","speaker":"1339"},{"type":"speech","time":1521726000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  I agree entirely with her on many of the issues she has raised.  Since my appointment to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been working on this issue with my officials and the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  It is the subject of a commitment given in the programme for Government adopted in May 2016.  We have gone a good way down the road in the development of a single point entry portal between the unit in my Department, the open government unit and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.<\/p><p>I have a prepared answer, but the Deputy will be glad to know that much of the engagement she has suggested has been initiated.  I have had engagement with the Acting Chairman and a number of other Deputies on other issues, but if it would be helpful, I would be delighted, if I can, to convene a meeting with the relevant officials and the Deputy at the earliest opportunity to bring her up to speed on the work we have done on the issue.  With reference to much of what she referred to, we have gone a good way down the road in looking at it, particularly other models.  One of the best examples available to Ireland for how the Government can best communicate with the citizenry through eGovernment, which forms another part of my responsibilities, is available in Estonia.  While we are not suggesting we move entirely in that direction, it does give us food for thought.<\/p><p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  It is the advocacy groups and those who claim to be representative of civil society that engage, but the vast majority, including the middle of the road person who gets up in the morning and sends his or her children to school or looks after somebody at home, do not have that level of engagement, unless they are involved in one of the organisations mentioned.  It behoves the Government to try to use every mechanism available to us at national and local level to provide the citizenry with an opportunity to hear about what the Government is doing.  That is the concept behind having a single entry point portal and making communications for the Government much more streamlined.  That is part of the remit I have been given.<\/p><p>The public consultation portal is being developed by the open government unit in conjunction with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  There was to be a launch of the portal shortly, but I have requested that prior to the launch it be further developed to allow users to receive email notifications and share consultations on social media.  I have asked the senior officials to meet to discuss that issue, but I have also asked them to examine an aspect about which I have a concern - the <i>ad hoc<\/i>nature of the carrying out of public consultation.  Week in, week out there are very large advertisements - sometimes smaller ones - in national and provincial newspapers about statutory requirements placed by every Department, local authority and so on on public consultation processes that have to be initiated.  We could do it much more simply and cost effectively by virtue of State agencies, Departments and other entities being able to log on and make people aware of them.  There is, however, the added difficulty of reaching people who do not have access to ICT services.  Therefore, there will be a requirement to continue along the traditional route for certain elements.<\/p><p>My reply has been circulated and I can go through it later, but the Deputy raised specific issues and I wanted to assure her that we had taken them into consideration.  To respond to the points she raised, I would be delighted to facilitate an opportunity for her to sit down with me and my officials to hear about what we have done so far and share her ideas in order that we can move forward in a manner that is in keeping with best practice.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200023#Y00100","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"speech","time":1521726000,"counter":345,"content":"<p>I cannot tell the Minister of State how happy his answer has made me because I raised this issue in the previous D&aacute;il with the then Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who undertook to investigate my idea, but between one thing and another, I did not get back to him to find out what was happening.  I would like to think I might have had some input into the proposal coming to fruition.  I am delighted about that.<\/p>  <p>  I am reassured by what the Minister of State said about not everybody having access to technology, yet it is a wonderful way for us to connect with people.  Having consultations accessible on online platforms and linked with the single entry point portal will be very helpful.  As a public representative, I like to think I am well informed on different things that are happening, but, as the Minister of State also said, perhaps the only time I realise there is a public consultation process is when I open a newspaper at the weekend.<\/p>  <p>  I am delighted with the news and will be very happy to take up the Minister of State's offer to avail of an opportunity to make a further input at some point with him and the officials in the Department because this will be a very significant development to enable citizens to have their say, be heard and, importantly, aware when a public consultation process is taking place and we want to hear what they have to say.  Policy and cultural changes are sometimes very difficult and it helps to consult citizens along the way to hear what they have to say, perhaps even before the commencement of a public consultation process.  It is crucial that we get the process right because we can see the mistakes that were made in the past when the people were not consulted or given adequate information, for which we all paid the price.

They are not two different coins but very much the same entity.  As I have often relayed to other Members of the House and my officials, we cannot have one without the other.  While until now I have been preoccupied in the drafting and completion of legislation on other issues, legislation which is almost ready to be brought before the House, this is an issue about which I feel strongly because consultation is not something that should just be initiated by the Government.  It should also be about finding out from citizens their concerns that may not necessarily be on the radar of Members.  With the greatest of respect to us, we are all very busy and whether we want to admit it, in some areas we are the captive of the bubble mentality.  Every Member is very busy.  As a result, our agendas are often driven by those who have access to information, including advocacy and civil society groups.  However, they do not include over 90% of the people who are not actively involved in any group and who may not want to attend a constituency clinic or get involved in a political party but who still wants to engage with the Government.  The quickest and most effective way to do this is through an online or electronic communications system.  There is a difficulty in that regard and the infrastructure to be used in creating it will not be put in place overnight.  It comes at a cost which has to be borne by the people.  It would be much easier if we had a magic wand in deciding whether I should bring forward a proposal in the House through the Department that would involve a lot of capital investment and that would meet with the support of Members.  I am not naive enough to believe that would happen because I know that some people would say it was an awful waste of money on a vanity project to engage in consultation with the people, but this is about investing long term in our democracy when the Government and politicians would be kept way more informed of the views of the people, as opposed to what we are being told by the Fifth Estate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200023#Y00300","speaker":"1267"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bord na M&oacute;na","time":1521726000,"counter":347,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200023#Y00350"},{"type":"speech","time":1521726000,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I am a bog woman and very proud of it.

They include the heritage and ecological system of the bog, horticulture and the employment the company has provided in the past eight years.  Only last week, at a meeting of Rathangan Tidy Towns committee, we discussed celebrating the heritage and employment benefits delivered by Bord na M&oacute;na.  People moved from other parts of Ireland to work for the company and settled in places such as Timahoe, Kilberry, Coill Dubh and Allenwood in County Kildare.  Their families have become part of the area. <\/p> <p> The Rathangan poet William A. Byrne has written many poems about the bog, including the following four lines:<\/p> <p>\tI was the broom and crooked heather,<\/p> <p>\tI was the moss that grew,<\/p> <p>\tBut time has moulded us together,<\/p> <p>\tBeneath the years of dew.<\/p> <p>While I accept that Bord na M&oacute;na is operating in a challenging environment, we must also ensure the company's long-term viability.

I understand the plant in Edenderry has reduced its use of peat by 40% under a carbon neutral initiative while maintaining the same number of jobs, which is crucial.<\/p> <p> Does the Minister support the concept of co-fuelling, an approach that certainly appears to make sense?  Does he continue to support a managed transition from peat to other fuels in the period to 2030?  Such a transition period will be important because it will give Bord na M&oacute;na an opportunity to enter new areas of business. <\/p> <p> Yesterday evening and this morning we received word that there were to be job losses at Bord na M&oacute;na.  I understand 45 jobs will be lost in ten locations, including seven in Newbridge and four in Lullymore, both of which are in County Kildare.  I invite the Minister to visit the Lullymore Heritage Centre close to the Bord na M&oacute;na operation in the area to show him what a wonderful job people in the area have done to celebrate the importance of the bog. <\/p> <p> To address the more important matter of job losses, it is fine if it suits people to take a redundancy package or leave the company.  However, there are many Bord na M&oacute;na employees who are not in a position to do so.

Incidentally, I hated every day I spent on the bog.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na employs approximately 450 people in County Kildare.  The company has a long association with the county, which historically centred on peat harvesting operations across bogs in the north and west of the county.  Bord na M&oacute;na's 450 County Kildare based employees are located at a number of centres, including the company's head office which has been located in Newbridge since 1994.  The head office provides the location for most of the group's central support services.  It also houses many of its business unit headquarters, including those for the fuels, horticulture and resource recovery businesses.  The resource recovery business headquarters also incorporates the call centre for the AES waste collection business.  Other significant Bord na M&oacute;na centres across the county include the horticulture facility in Kilberry, the resource recovery facility in Drehid and peat harvesting operations across a number of bogs.<\/p>  <p>  With the exception of the fuels business, none of these areas is affected by yesterday's decision.  It should be noted that the decision does not affect the approximately 120 people who are involved in the manufacture of the company's peat briquettes at Derrinlough, County Offaly.  Yesterday's decision by the company to cease operations in its coal business will affect 11 of the 450 employees in County Kildare, of whom seven are located in Newbridge and four at a convenience fuels facility in Lullymore.  The company is engaging with the affected employees and will consult them on possible outcomes, including redeployment.<\/p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na informed employees yesterday of the decision to exit the coal business for a number of commercial and regulatory reasons.  As the Deputy will be aware, Bord na M&oacute;na is a commercial semi-State company and while operational matters are the responsibility of the board and management team and do not come directly within my area of responsibility or functions, I am nonetheless acutely conscious of the impact of the recent decision on employees of the company.  The underlying reasons for the move away from coal form part of the company's transition from its traditional business activities towards a business model that is sustainable in the long term.  This includes the coal-firing of the peat-fired power stations in Edenderry, Lanesboro and Shannonbridge.<\/p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question, I support the company's transition and attended the public consultation days in the parochial hall in Shannonbridge and St. Mary's Hall in Lanesboro, at which we engaged with members of the community and explained what we were planning to do to transition from peat to biomass in the next decade or thereabouts.  My priority is to ensure biomass is generated and grown as close as possible to the three peat-fired power stations.  The intention is to maintain and, I hope, enhance current employment levels in Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am acutely conscious of the importance of the employment provided by the company across the midland counties, extending from east County Galway to counties Roscommon, Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and Kildare.  I am determined to put in place a sustainable transition and maintain the maximum possible number of employees in the areas in which the company currently operates.  The same types of equipment and skill sets will be used to bring biomass into the peat-fired power stations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200024#Z00200","speaker":"1234"},{"type":"speech","time":1521726600,"counter":353,"content":"<p>I am reassured by the Minister's commitment to sustain employment in Bord na M&oacute;na.

There is a serious question about getting proper ladders to reach higher floors.  It must be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  People will say it is too early for answers and the Minister will probably say the same thing.  These questions must be answered, especially when we consider there are even higher skyscrapers around the city, with more being built.  We cannot have a fire service that is under-resourced.  There are serious problems with recruitment in the fire service and the equipment being used.  This has been raised a number of times.  Attempts to remove the ambulance service from the fire brigade have been ongoing for a number of years and it is totally unacceptable.  Everybody knows that the first people responding are the ambulance service personnel in the fire brigade.  They are always on hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200025#AA00500","speaker":"1303"},{"type":"speech","time":1521727200,"counter":359,"content":"<p>I thank Deputies for raising this very important matter.  A fire broke out in an apartment on the 13th floor of the Metro Hotel and apartment building in Ballymun at approximately 8 p.m. last night, Wednesday, 21 March 2018.  The fire extensively damaged the 13th and 10th floors of the building.  The building was evacuated successfully and there are no reports of missing persons or injuries at this point.  Eleven units of Dublin Fire Brigade, comprising eight fire engines, two aerial appliances and the incident command unit, involving approximately 60 firefighters under the command of the chief fire officer, responded and assisted with evacuation, as well as fighting the fire.<\/p><p>The fire has now been extinguished but the fire brigade remains in attendance.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was at the scene overnight and managed traffic in the area to facilitate firefighting.  It is understood the Garda will investigate the cause of the fire.  The Dublin Fire Brigade will also carry out an initial review of the scene and its response in the days ahead.  At this point, I am sure Deputies on all sides will join with me in expressing appreciation to the emergency services and all others involved in responding to the incident last night.  I was kept informed as events unfolded through liaison between the fire brigade and officials in my Department.  None of us is on the front line when it comes to these types of emergencies but it seems very tense from our point of view.  We can only imagine what the firefighters felt.  They are incredibly brave in the work they do.<\/p> <p> I turn now to the fire safety task force.  I established it in response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy of 14 June 2017 in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety in Ireland.  On 27 June 2017, I tasked my Department's National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management with convening and co-ordinating a high level task force to lead Ireland's reappraisal of fire safety.<\/p> <p> The task force held its tenth and most recent meeting on 22 February 2018.  It discussed the most up to date draft of its report.  In the intervening time, the national directorate had to deal with the significant snow event associated with Storm Emma and has not had an opportunity to consider the task force members' feedback on this latest draft.  Notwithstanding this, I expect to receive the full report of the task force before the end of April.<\/p> <p> In addition to establishing the task force, local authorities were requested to undertake a number of initial actions and the task force was requested to oversee and report on a review of fire safety in both social housing and fire safety in medium to high rise buildings.  As part of these initial actions, local authorities, in June of last year, were asked to assess multistorey social housing buildings' fire detection and alarm systems, emergency lighting systems and common escape routes, including corridors, stairways and emergency exits, and to ensure that such systems are in place and fully functional.<\/p> <p> The local authorities responded fully to my request and carried out the inspections and works arising within the required timeframes.  To give an indication of the extent of this exercise, 1,230 multi-storey social housing buildings in Ireland were reported back to my Department.  They contain 16,780 flats.  The four Dublin local authority areas had 64% of the buildings and 77% of the flats, the two Cork local authority areas had 7% of the buildings and 5% of the flats and the Limerick local authority area had 4% of the buildings and 4% of the flats.  Overall, the review was a comprehensive exercise.  It highlighted that local authorities are fully engaged in their fire safety responsibilities to those who rely on social housing.<\/p> <p> This initial work in respect of the appraisal of fire safety in medium to high rise buildings was carried out and all local authorities have reported back to my Department as requested.  The work undertaken has identified 842 buildings within the medium and high rise category.  A total of 291 of these were identified as having certain categories of external cladding.  After preliminary consideration, local authorities, using their powers under section 18(6) of the Fire Services Act, have requested the persons having control of 237 of these buildings to have detailed fire safety assessments carried out.  The work by persons having control of these buildings, and their professional advisers, to carry out and report the fire safety assessments is ongoing.  As of the end of January, 99 fire safety assessments had been received by fire authorities, and further action is proposed or under consideration in eight cases - six residential and two non-residential.<\/p> <p> A guidance note - fire safety guidance note 01 of 2017 - Assessing existing cladding systems in buildings of more than six storeys, or more than 18 m in height - was developed by a task force subgroup and has been circulated to fire authorities and placed on my Department's website as a support for those undertaking assessments of cladding in medium to high rise building.  The task force subgroup will maintain oversight of the review of these assessments in the months ahead, dealing with any emergent issues and providing an oversight report at the end of the process.  It is understood the building in Ballymun which went on fire last night was identified in the survey of medium to high-rise buildings undertaken as part of the work of the fire safety task force in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.  Initial indications are that cladding was not a contributory factor in this fire.<\/p> <p> As indicated earlier, the fire will now be the subject to a full Garda investigation.  The outcome will, of course, be carefully considered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200025#AA00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":361,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200026#BB00200","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":362,"content":"<p>I hoped I might have additional time because the Deputies had additional time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200026#BB00300","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I will be flexible given the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200026#BB00400","speaker":"1324"},{"type":"speech","time":1521727800,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I appreciate that very much.<\/p>  <p>  The fleet of fire engines available to fire services requires ongoing investment to ensure that reliable and appropriate fire engines are available to respond to emergencies.

It will see the construction and delivery of 23 new appliances between 2018 and 2020, with an expected contribution of &euro;400,000 per unit from my Department's capital programme.

However, because of the upgrade of those apartment blocks that must be done following that disastrous fire, the residents may now be charged significant amounts of money.  The Minister cannot say to people who are struggling with mortgages that they have to find thousands of extra euro or get out an additional mortgage or loan to fund fire safety.  I refer to the fact that they got a certificate stressing fire safety was adequate when they bought their apartment or acquired their mortgage.  That has to be addressed.<\/p>  <p>  We also have to look at the proposal of the Minister and his party to have high rise as the new norm in Dublin without having adequate fire safety.

Further detailed assessments of fire and life safety measures were deemed to be needed for 237 buildings.  As of the end of January this year, 99 of those assessments had taken place.

It is doing the actual work and then preparing a report on that work, which will inform us what we need to do in the future.<\/p> <p> That work has been interrupted by Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma because it is the same group of people doing the work.  Any new learning that will come from this latest incident will be considered when we have that work done by both the Garda and the fire services.  When we have the report from the task force, including the extensive work done in all local authority owned multi-storey complexes, this will be published.  What happened last night in Ballymun was a serious and dangerous event.  Our emergency firefighters and those who helped people evacuate the hotel acquitted themselves admirably, as well as showing bravery and courage.  What happened last night will not undermine our ambition for more high-rise buildings in Dublin.  It is a key feature of what we need to do to deliver for the housing needs of our people.  We can do it with safe buildings and have the fire services in place to ensure public safety and the safety of those who live in these buildings.<\/p> <p> For those who suffered in this event, there are all sorts of supports available to them, in particular, the emergency needs payment.

I have introduced much legislation both from the Opposition and Government benches over my time as a Member.  Most legislation is focused on specific issues.  This particular Bill, however, is actually informed by my five years in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform when there was an extraordinary focus at that stage on measuring a much wounded economy.  The mechanism our international partners required us to use was the standard measurement of gross domestic product, GDP.  This became an overarching and important measure.  If we did not reach the criteria set by our funders in reducing our deficit as a proportion of GDP, and if we did not raise the 3% deficit target within the specified timeline, our funding would have been withdrawn.  It struck me right through that process that it was a sterile and an inadequate measure of the performance of the economy.  It was necessary but, as a stand-alone instrument, it was shallow.<\/p><p>We in Ireland now stand at a moment of tremendous opportunity after a lost decade of economic retrenchment.  Any Government over the coming several years will have an additional resource of at least &euro;3 billion a year.  With such funds available, delivering on our cherished dream of a fair and equal Ireland is for the first time in our history within our grasp.  We in the Labour Party know our goals for the future of our country.  We want a society in which every citizen, to the extent of her or his ability, is properly equipped to participate in the social, economic and cultural life of our nation.  Although our perspectives and policies might differ, many Members will agree now is the time to be ambitious for our country and our people.  There are not many Members now who would repeat the infamous declaration of Margaret Thatcher that there is no such thing as society.<\/p><p>It is all well and good to outline high aspirational levels of ambition.  However, how will we decide to achieve those ambitions and what mechanisms will make the differences we want?  We need goals but we need a plan and to prioritise.  We also need the tools to measure the outcomes of society.  This is true of all Governments and all political parties preparing manifestoes, regardless of one's politics or ideological view.  Our common future will be shaped by the choices we make about employment, the environment and genuine equality of citizenship.  It reaches into health care facilities, the elderly, young people, education and every other aspect of public life and administration.  If we shape that future in a meaningful and real way, then we need to measure the impact of all our decisions.<\/p><p>That is what the Genuine Progress Indicators and National Distributional Accounts Bill 2017 is about.  It is not about abandoning the traditional economic indicators of GDP, GNP, gross national product, or the new hybrid model, GNI*, gross national income (Star), after GNP itself was so criticised as a model for Ireland after a growth rate of 26%.  I will not bore the House explaining how that is calculated.  All of these are important because we need to measure our outputs.  However, without sustainable growth, none of our ambitions can be realised.  The Bill is about adding something new and fundamentally important to that mix and calculation.  It is about agreeing formal independently assessed measurements for the impact of government policy on all the important factors which shape what is truly important, namely the quality of life of our people.  There is no point in talking statistics if people's health services are inadequate, if their life expectancy or their life chances are not improving, or if the air we breathe, the water we drink and all the amenities we enjoy are not of a high standard.  We have to start measuring these because they are just as important as any economic growth statistics.<\/p><p>The truth is that growth indicators do not tell us the full story.  It is important to know GNP and GDP.  If one takes those measurements in isolation, however, then we overvalue the production and consumption of goods because that is all they measure.  In turn, we fail to measure how much that growth reflects on genuine improvements for our people.  Measurements such as this can play tricks on us.  For example, if a factory creates pollution but then contributes through it to economic growth, it is measured as a good thing.  If one spends money fixing the pollution caused by the factory, that is further economic growth, which is measured as a good thing.  However, in reality that is bizarre.<\/p><p>The economist Simon Kuznets created the concept of GDP in 1934 when he developed it as a tool for measuring economic growth.  At the time he wrote to the US Congress:<\/p><blockquote>The welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income.  Distinctions must be kept in mind between quantity and quality of growth, between its costs and return, and between the short and the long term.  Goals for more growth should specify more growth of what.<\/blockquote><p>That is an important question.  What is it for and what does it contribute to the sum of our human good?  It is because of arguments like these that more and more countries are turning to new measurements, not as alternatives but as real and important supplements to give a fuller and more accurate account of the well-being of their people.<\/p><p>I believe the role of genuine progress indicators, GPIs for short, will be to supplement the current measurements we have.  Of course, when we get into the detail of these proposals, there will be plenty of scope for argument about what precisely we should measure and what parts of the economy we should give weight to, and we can debate that.  These are important policy choices but making policy choices is what politics should be about.  I look forward to the debate on the merits of the choices I have made in this Bill.<br\/><br\/>I do not have the opportunity, given the speaking time, to go through the Bill in any great detail and it is hoped we will do that in committee.  However, there is a second and equally important part to this Bill that I want to highlight for the House, and that is the proposal that we measure and publish national distribution accounts.  We all know the last couple of decades have been good for capital growth but less so for income growth.  While the world has grown richer, income inequality has increased in most countries.  Policymakers and economists internationally have seen that trend and it has undoubtedly been a matter of important focus and the cause of a lot of head-scratching as to how it has come about.  The first step must be to measure it accurately and comprehensively.<br\/><br\/>At present, our national accounts focus on the macro totals that I know only too well.  It is left to smaller-scale inequality studies to focus on the distribution of growth, and we do not do that in a particularly successful way.  These studies, surveys and tax data are often not the most comprehensive way of doing this.  As policymakers, we need accurate information to answer questions such as what fraction of economic growth at present accrues to the bottom half of the income level of the population, to the middle grouping or to the top 10%, and whether those distribution fractions are changing over time.  Are the rich getting richer, are the poor getting poorer, is economic growth having an equal impact on everybody and how is it having that impact?<br\/><br\/>I am standing beside the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  Our redistributive polices assisted greatly in equalising our society through tax transfers and public spending transfers, especially in the social welfare area, during our time of real economic difficulty.  We had good redistributive mechanisms but the base level of income distribution in this country is very bad, and we need to know these things.  We all have to agree about how this measurement should be done, but we do not fully and accurately have a mechanism for doing it right now.<br\/><br\/>This Bill seeks to address what I believe are two important deficiencies in our national statistics, and I will try to precis this in the short speaking time I have.  We need to have an agreed and independently measured set of genuine progress indicators on health status, on education status, on income redistribution, on the quality of our environment, air and water, and on access to amenity, all of which are socially important.  The Bill would confer a new statutory function on the Central Statistics Office and the National Economic and Social Council to do that work.<br\/><br\/>I should make clear that, in what follows, we in the Labour Party made our best effort to define what we believe are the issues that should be measured.  However, as always in a legislative measure like this, we will be open to the views of every Member of this House.  I genuinely believe this is a task that everybody should, could and will work collaboratively in achieving.  We have defined &quot;national distribution accounts&quot; as meaning accounts that seek to measure the distribution of national income, including the distribution of economic growth, to compute growth rates for each quartile of income distribution.  While I am sounding like an economist again, in essence, the point is the impact on each quartile of the population in terms of income, growth and policy decisions.<br\/><br\/>In the following sections of the Bill I have defined &quot;genuine progress indicators&quot; as meaning a measurement that supplements gross national income as a measure of economic growth, one that is designed to take full account of the well-being of the community by incorporating environmental and social factors which are not otherwise measured, and that integrates physical and monetary measures of human, social, environmental and economic well-being.  While it sounds technical, it is simply a human societal measurement of the well-being of Ireland as a whole, as opposed to simply looking at economic growth in terms of extending production and consumption.  I have added a table which provides examples, although they are simply indicative.<br\/><br\/>Under the heading &quot;economic accounts&quot; I would include measures such as gross national income, the balance of trade, disposable income in each household, expenditure, debt and whether household debt is rising or falling, Government business, student debt, employment, unemployment and underemployment, which is a huge issue because people are registered as employed but they are not getting a living wage.  We would measure all of these things.  In international statistics currently, while gross national product is a measurement of a country's performance, more countries include purchasing power parity as an equivalent.  Gross national product divided by the population, giving GNP <i>per capita<\/i>, is a very crude measurement.  What does it mean?  On the other hand, purchasing parity comparators appear more relevant.  For example, if a person in a country like Pakistan has $20,000 in income, that person's purchasing power is immeasurably different from a person with an income of $20,000 living in London in terms of the cost of food, rent, a taxi fare and so on.  These are the real human impact measurements that we want to achieve.<br\/><br\/>I hope the Government will facilitate a very full debate on what I regard as one of the most important pieces of legislation I have had the privilege to introduce in the House.  If we change the way we measure progress, we will actually change the way progress is achieved.  I heartily recommend the Bill to the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200027#CC00300","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521729000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>There is a growing demand for data on societal progress and well-being, and I thank Deputy Howlin for raising this important matter.  While economic indicators such as gross domestic product are a useful measure of the overall progress of an economy, they reveal little about the well-being of citizens or the distribution of economic growth among different sectors of society.  To measure societal well-being, supplementary indicators, including some of those referred to in the Bill, are therefore needed.<\/p>  <p>  Having said that, while the Government shares the Deputy's views regarding the importance and value of a broader measurement of societal well-being and progress, the Government opposes this Bill for the following reasons.  First, the Bill would potentially impact on the independence of the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The Bill would require the National Economic and Social Council to approve the methodology for the compilation of the genuine progress indicators and national distribution accounts.  This would undermine the statutory independence of the CSO, whereby the director general has sole responsibility for and is independent in deciding the production of statistics, the statistical methodology, the content of releases and the timing and method of dissemination of statistics.  This independence is enshrined in statute, under the Statistics Act 1993, and is explicitly referenced in the European statistics code of practice.  The independence of national statistical institutes, such as the CSO, is also an established principle in Council Regulation 223\/2009 on European statistics and in the UN fundamental principles of official statistics.  It reflects best practice for the organisation of official statistics and ensures statistics are independent, impartial and reliable.  The Government, in its commitment on confidence in statistics, on 30 May 2017 reconfirmed its commitment to continue to guarantee the independence of the CSO and the National Statistics Board.<\/p>  <p>  Second, the work programme of the CSO is largely defined by requirements arising from EU regulations and it is already challenging to balance those obligations with meeting the needs of national users.<\/p><p>If the Bill is passed, the CSO would be obliged to add activities to its statistical programme without regard to the cost or competing demand for statistics, including its obligations under EU regulations.  The passing of the Bill in its current form would impose revisions to established CSO work plans and business structures, resulting in delays to outputs that are already in progress and should address the principal data needs identified in the Bill.  Those needs overlap with priorities already identified, including by the National Statistics Board.  The NSB provides strategic direction to the CSO and establishes priorities for the compilation and development of official statistics. These data needs are, at least in part, addressed in current releases or will be satisfied by measures that are under development.<br\/><br\/>As part of its work, the NSB has identified gaps in the Irish statistical programme in the areas of health, energy and the environment as well as a growing demand for new indicators on well-being and social progress.  Reflecting these priorities, the CSO has established two new divisions: environment and energy; and income, consumption and wealth.<br\/><br\/>Under section 3, the Bill proposes that the CSO collect, compile and publish genuine progress indicators relating to economic accounts, social and human health accounts and environmental accounts on a yearly basis.  A number of these are already published by the CSO.  Regarding economic accounts, Government debt, net worth and savings figures are published in the Government finance statistics release.  Regarding social and human health accounts, the CSO published The Wellbeing of the Nation 2017 in January, its first such report.  That report is a composite report of more than 30 indictors across eight themes: economy; work; education; housing and natural environment; governance and equality, health; public safety; and time use.  The release of well-being data is a new initiative for the CSO and will be further developed in the future.  The CSO consulted the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, on the development of these indicators.<br\/><br\/>The CSO publishes on a biennial basis a sustainable development indicators report and is a participant in a pilot programme for capturing data on the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs.  To date, 60 indicators for 14 of the 17 SDGs have been published.<br\/><br\/>Last month, the CSO published higher education outcomes &ndash; graduates of 2010 to 2014 - and, in June 2017, it published for the first time a system of health accounts release.<br\/><br\/>Since the establishment of the environmental and energy division, the CSO has almost doubled its number of environmental publications.  Four new environmental publications are scheduled to be published this year covering some of the indicators listed in the Bill.<br\/><br\/>As the Deputy pointed out, section 3 of the Bill also proposes that the CSO would compile and publish national distributional accounts on a yearly basis to measure the distribution of economic growth.  The importance of the distribution of income, consumption and wealth in determining the economic well-being of people and material inequalities has been recognised at a European level.  It has, therefore, been agreed that a conceptual framework of standards and methods for European income, consumption and wealth statistics will be developed.<br\/><br\/>The CSO conducts surveys of household income and income distribution through the survey on income and living conditions, SILC, of consumption through its household budget survey and, on an <i>ad hoc<\/i>basis, of wealth through the household finance and consumption survey.  The SILC is the official source of data on household and individual income and provides a number of key national poverty indicators, such as the at-risk-of-poverty rate, the consistent poverty rate and rates of enforced deprivation.  It further measures income equality across the entire income distribution.  The CSO conducted a household finance and consumption survey in 2013 and will conduct a second such survey in 2018 for publication in late 2019.  The CSO is proposing to embed this wealth survey into its programme of household surveys.  The expansion of this work on wealth-related statistics would provide the full picture of the distribution of income, consumption and wealth.<br\/><br\/>As this model evolves, the intention of the CSO is to publish statistics on the joint distribution of income, consumption and wealth.  The CSO is also beginning to develop options regarding national distribution accounts, which will involve producing estimates of the distribution of income and wealth that are consistent with national accounts macro aggregates.<br\/><br\/>Considering all the work currently under way, it does not seem necessary to legislate to create a parallel statutory process involving the NESC to identify further statistical requirements in these areas.<br\/><br\/>The Bill proposes assigning new functions to the NESC, which would be required to approve the methodology for the compilation of genuine progress indicators and national distributional accounts.  Under section 4, the Bill also proposes that the NESC would be required to produce an assessment each year of the impact of the budget on economic and social inequality, poverty reduction, and income and wealth distribution.  The NESC would be required every five years to assess these impacts in terms of the cumulative effect of the previous five budgets.<br\/><br\/>In addition to impinging on the statistical independence of the CSO, the assignment through legislation of additional functions to the NESC would impact on its ability to achieve its current work programme.  As the House will be aware, the role of the NESC is to analyse and provide advice on strategic policy matters relevant to Ireland's economic, social, environmental and sustainable development.  The council's current work programme up to 2019 comprises three themes.  First is a key social challenge: low-work intensity households, quality tailored services and participation.  Second is climate change: governance of the low-carbon transition.  Third is land value, land use and urban development.<br\/><br\/>Over the coming years, Ireland faces into a period of significant change at home and abroad that will present new and exceptional challenges.  A Programme for a Partnership Government specifically notes that there are policy challenges where long-term thinking is required.  It is important that the NESC, as a research and advisory body, has the scope and flexibility around its work programme to be able to take on board Government priorities and address issues that have emerged from its own work or consultations.<br\/><br\/>Following the end of the term of the previous council in 2016, some time was taken to reflect on its role and working methods.  A number of changes were made aimed at making the council more effective, including fewer plenary meetings, more in-depth discussions on issues through working groups and committees, and a reduced membership while also capturing a broad range of views.  The new council was appointed in 2017 and the priority now is to bed down these changes and allow the NESC to fulfil its strategic advisory role.  It is appropriate to allow these changes to become firmly established in advance of legislating to give significant new functions to the NESC.<br\/><br\/>It is not clear that the NESC is best placed to produce impact assessments of budget measures.  A wide range of bodies already engage in budget scrutiny, including the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Parliamentary Budget Office and civil society stakeholders such as Social Justice Ireland.  The Departments of Finance and Employment Affairs and Social Protection conduct an <i>ex post<\/i>impact assessment of the main tax and social welfare measures introduced in the budget.  The ESRI, using data from the CSO's SILC, publishes its assessment of the progressivity of the budgetary measures introduced.  A new social impact assessment framework has been designed that broadens the scope of the analysis and focuses on schemes and spending programmes that have explicit socioeconomic objectives.<br\/><br\/>Additionally, the programme for Government contains a commitment to &quot;develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.&quot;  A policy paper, entitled Equality Budgeting: Proposed Next Steps in Ireland, was published alongside budget 2018.  A pilot approach to gender budgeting has been adopted in the Revised Estimates for public services 2018, published in December 2017, with six Departments including indicators relating to equality objectives.  The intention is that the publication of high-level objectives and associated indicators will enhance transparency around the level of progress towards achieving equality objectives.  The pilot programme of equality budgeting will be reviewed following the 2018 budgetary cycle.  Lessons from the pilot approach will be used to expand the initiative to other expenditure programmes and equality dimensions for the 2019 budgetary cycle.<br\/><br\/>For all the aforementioned reasons, the Government does not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to introduce primary legislation prescribing the types of statistical releases to be published by the CSO or assigning new functions to the NESC.  However, we acknowledge the intention behind the Bill and I reiterate that the CSO is committed to developing indicators that go beyond GDP and is well advanced in meeting the user need for a measure of progress beyond GDP as identified by the NSB in its long-term strategy.<br\/><br\/>The CSO is always open to engaging with stakeholders, including the Oireachtas, on identifying statistical needs and data gaps.  A mid-term review of the NSB's strategy will be launched in the near future, which will provide a further opportunity for stakeholders to engage on user needs.<\/p><p>Such engagement would be a more appropriate way of identifying needs than primary legislation such as this Bill and more valuable to the user.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200028#DD00200","speaker":"1290","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521730200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>I am pleased to contribute to this debate and compliment Deputy Brendan Howlin on bringing forward the Bill because there is huge merit in what he has outlined in terms of the measurement of progress in this country.  It is hugely relevant in the Ireland of today because of the society that has been created where communities have been built that are devoid of the basic public infrastructure required for a fulfilling family life.  One must ask if we are truly assessing how the country is doing if the only metrics used to analyse our current circumstances are the crude tools currently in place.  Many in our society have been saddled with massive personal debt through the purchase of their homes.<\/p><p>It is interesting that the debate on Second Stage of the Bill is taking place on this date because on 18 March 1968, almost exactly 40 years ago, Bobby Kennedy made some historic remarks on the subject in the University of Kansas where he addressed the value of gross domestic product and its measurement of the things that mattered.  He stated:<\/p><blockquote>Gross National Product counts cigarette advertising ... special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them ... armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities ... [and] the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.  Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages ... It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.<\/blockquote><p>His words 40 years ago ring true today and for every generation because at some point everybody realises what is important in life.  The measurement of goods and services produced is not a true reflection of how we are doing as a society.  If we were to canvass in any of the massive housing estates in the country we would see whether those very sterile indicators were a real reflection of how well society was doing.  Things may be improving gradually for some in the country but many such as those who fear their mortgages may be offloaded to vulture funds by unscrupulous banks have seen no improvement in their circumstances.  The measurement of what is happening to those who have a few more euro in their pockets in society as a whole is not necessarily positive.  <\/p><p>Deputy Brendan Howlin mentioned Mr. Simon Kuznets, the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measuresments of national income.  In his report to Congress in 1934 he stated:  <\/p><blockquote>Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known.  And no income measurement undertakes to estimate the reverse side of income, that is, the intensity and unpleasantness of effort going into the earning of income.<\/blockquote><p>There is huge merit in the Bill and the principles contained within it.  It will resonate massively with Irish people who may have good employment, but the circumstances in which they live their lives tell a different story.  <\/p><p>We must consider the tools necessary to measure today's society which has been massively altered in the past 20 years, in particular.  Hundreds of thousands of people from Dublin are living in counties such as my own, County Meath, as well as counties Kildare, Wicklow, Louth and further afield because they could not find affordable housing in their own county.  There is a complete lack of vital public infrastructure in many of the new communities that have been created.  I mention this because of the table Deputy Brendan Howlin has outlined in the Bill of the indicators he seeks to measure.  Vital social infrastructure is lacking, including child care facilities, libraries, swimming pools and recreational facilities.  Health services are at breaking point.  This week the local newspaper in my town of Navan ran a front page story about people being turned away from doctors' practices.  Many communities are devoid of proper public transport links which would allow the people we have put into the commuter counties to commute to their place of work in the city.  Some must rely on existing overburdened public transport services, while in other areas there is simply no service available.  My home town of Navan has a population in excess of 35,000 people, but there is no train line and no hope of getting one under the Ireland 2040 plan.  What kind of life do the thousands of people who have to commute from the town at 5.30 a.m. each day have?  Do the metrics currently used give a proper reflection of the life they lead and indicate that all is happy and well based on a crude analysis of income?  They do not.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Oireachtas Library and Research Service afforded Members the opportunity to look at CSO statistics superimposed on constituency maps.  It drilled down townland by townland and street by street to find out how many people were employed and unemployed in each area and to reveal the figures for youth unemployment.  That is the cold statistical analysis, but Members know the stories behind each of these areas and about the other important aspects such as the debt with which people have been saddled, the lack of infrastructure in certain areas and the impact on areas surrounding these townlands.<\/p><p>There would be huge merit in examining other aspects, as outlined in the Bill.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the principles behind the Bill, although it will need further detailed scrutiny to ascertain its full impact.  The CSO is an independent agency and we would not compel it to use metrics which it believes may be inaccurate owing to a lack of data.  Notwithstanding this, the Bill and this debate are hugely important and have significant merit because Members must always have the interests of those whom they represent at the centre of their minds when discussing what is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200030#FF00200","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1521730200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to welcome the Bill on genuine progress indicators which are the only way to measure the well-being of a nation and its people.  Until now, we have had <i>ad hoc<\/i>and partial responses in looking at budget time at the brief impact of national economic and budgetary policy but not in the profound ways proposed in the Bill.  The Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, has commenced a study of gender equality budgeting.  The basic programme of action in this area which is being pursued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform offers an opportunity to finally have a serious gender equality impact analysis of each budget from budget 2018 onwards.  We are targeting budget 2019, in particular, with reference to areas such as child care and encouraging more young women to take up apprenticeships and so on.  I have requested - the committee has agreed to my request - that a disability impact analysis be promoted and monitored in respect of budget 2019.  In the coming weeks the committee will be meeting Senator John Dolan who chairs the Oireachtas disability group, of which I am also a member, and other leading advocates in the disability sector.<\/p><p>As I stated, there have been very cursory attempts in the past to poverty-proof budgets.  Essentially, they amounted to public relations exercises.  Budget expenditure books generally included two or three pages of poorly researched data to try to put forward the idea that even draconian austerity budgets were somehow fair.<\/p><p>Indeed, Deputy Howlin, as former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will be familiar with those from the past.  There was never a serious effort to estimate the often vicious impacts of budgetary decreases on the most vulnerable sectors of our community, who went through a lot of suffering.  I recall, for example as a Labour Party energy spokesperson in the past, developing policies to address energy poverty, but there was poor statistical and research data on this crucial aspect of poverty although every year people&rsquo;s lives were shortened by energy poverty.  There was no proper appreciation on the part of Government of this huge area in poverty, particularly for senior citizens.<\/p> <p> We also had the phenomenon of the green impact analysis of budgets when the Green Party was in power with Fianna F&aacute;il, the headings of which are echoed in section 2 of this Bill under environmental accounts.  The then Minister, John Gormley, came into the House and gave a pointless review of mostly green aspirations which Fianna F&aacute;il had no intention of fulfilling.  That Government, of course, led the country into a terrible crash.<\/p> <p> During the 2011-2016 austerity Government, led by Fine Gael, I introduced the High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014.  The Bill sought to establish a nine-person commission within the Central Statistics Office, CSO, whose task would be to regularly inform the public about levels of wealth and income across Irish society.  Data collection and compilation on income and wealth were the starting point and the Bill was inspired by states such as Norway where everybody&rsquo;s income and level of taxable wealth is freely available to all citizens.  Any citizen can find out what the wealth and income is of any other citizen.  The Minister at the time, Deputy Noonan, thought the proposal astonishing and hilarious.<\/p> <p> The commission I proposed was to engage in research on best practice models of income distribution, which echoes in the first table in Deputy Howlin's Bill under economic accounts.  It was to seek to determine an appropriate structure in which the awarding of executive high pay and other remuneration may be reformed.  The Bill was aimed at outrageous executive high pay, notably of bankers and bosses in the construction sector, who paid themselves millions of euro per annum.  That Bill went much further towards enabling a fairer and more equal society than Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s Bill before us today but the general approach in Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s legislation is a useful starting point for what my 2014 legislation was seeking to achieve.  Sadly, of course, the High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill 2014 was strongly rejected by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Howlin&rsquo;s former colleague, and the Bill was voted down by the Fine Gael-led austerity Government.<\/p> <p> Legislating for the concept of genuine progress indicators in section 2 of the Bill, or socioeconomic indicators, would be a valuable step forward to move towards a more egalitarian society.  Deputy Howlin has given useful examples in section 2(2) of the areas which would be key genuine progress indicators for national distributional accounts.  At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of course, we have grappled with the problems of measuring GNP and GDP, especially after the incredible statistical jump in 2015.  The new GNI* index seeks to address some of the volatility caused by multinational capital and knowledge movements but even GNI* is only a very broad and tentative measure of Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance.  Indeed, it was interesting today to read Kieran McQuinn of ESRI saying that a totally new index was necessary to measure underlying growth in the Irish economy, never mind move to the kind of analysis in which this Bill rightly asks us to engage, given the distortions of the part caused by our large multinational sector.<\/p> <p> The collection of much better data on citizen&rsquo;s livelihoods, including household savings and expenditure, would be an important step forward.  The inclusion of transport infrastructure is also useful and it was interesting to hear Deputy Cassells speaking about transport links to County Meath to serve the growing population in the county.  The big lacuna, however, in the suggested list for economic accounts is housing.  Did the last two austerity Governments carry out any cost-effectiveness analysis of the total shutting down of social and public housing, and the problems the huge backlog in social housing has caused?  Any such cost-effective analysis would have shown that the future personal and social costs were staggering and far overshadowed arrangements made to finance the outrageous blanket bank guarantee.<\/p> <p> The suggested social and human health accounts would also be very helpful.  Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy and Social Justice Ireland have drawn our attention to how badly Ireland is performing on a range of UN-backed indicators covering the economy, environment and society.  Social Justice Ireland&rsquo;s sustainable progress index 2018 highlights how poorly Ireland has performed on low pay, long-term unemployment, household debt and greenhouse gas emissions, so the metrics outlined under social and human health accounts are very important.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin's second list of useful indicators, the social and human wealth accounts, are very valuable, particularly in relation to unpaid work and the work of carers, who do a huge amount of work which society barely recognises in GDP or GNI figures.  Road traffic accidents are included under the human capital, health and wellness heading and I have a particular interest in this.  Indeed, I am pursuing reforming legislation to bring about Vision Zero for road transport.  The huge impact on people's lives from the maladministration of traffic law has a negative impact on society.  The environmental accounts, the environmental footprint analysis, the natural capital accounts and the ecosystem services to which the Deputy refers are also very valuable.<\/p> <p> The Genuine Progress Indicators and National Distributional Accounts Bill 2017 is an important Bill and it would give a useful remit to statisticians in our national organisations to pursue certain indicators.  In other countries, especially Scandinavia, they have experience of monitoring areas which impact on citizens' lives and it would be right to do the same in this country.  We would then be able to frame national economic and budgetary policy from a standpoint of real knowledge of how our people are living.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200030#FF00300","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521730800,"counter":381,"content":"<p>I welcome this Bill from Deputy Howlin and Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting it.  Ever since the Nobel laureate, Paul Krugman, tweeted about leprechaun economics, the use of GDP as a way of measuring our national accounts has come to close to being a laughing stock.  The progress made in coming up with GNI*, a unique way of measuring our unique economy, is welcome but ultimately the EU, for example, measures only GDP, GNI and so on.  Like GNI*, its impact is only to provide a fuller picture.  Legally, in terms of fiscal rules and so on, I do not believe it is designed to have any impact.  It is worthwhile, though.<\/p>  <p>  Only a fool thinks the state of a country can be measures in economic figures.  Bhutan measures gross national happiness, and why not?  We are not quite going that far but this Bill maps out alternative ways of measuring how well or otherwise we are doing.  It also touches on equality budgeting, with the National Economic and Social Council being mandated to report annually and every five years on the equality impact of budgets or a series of budgets.  There has been, to be fair, a lot of progress in this area with the Department of Finance providing far more detail each year on the breakdown of who benefits and who does not.  There are people who are still prone to spin, though, and a more neutral body to carry out this work is a worthwhile suggestion.<\/p>  <p>  Section 2 defines genuine progress indicators.

During a booming Irish economy, it was the day on which time was called by the disastrous fall in stock prices that engulfed Bear Stearns and when the writing was on the wall for the casino capital model of Anglo Irish Bank.  However, the problem was not confined to Anglo Irish Bank.  Like a horror movie, it went on to destroy the rest of the banks and the Irish economy.  What was the outcome of the St. Patrick's Day massacre?  Not too long after it, Bertie Ahern announced that he was going to stand down as Taoiseach, which he did.  Brian Cowen took over and was very unhappy for a while because he was the person who was going to succeed Mr. Ahern.  Mr. Cowen succeeded him not in the best of times, which I think was what he expected, but in the worst of times.  Nonetheless, that summer, that new Fianna F&aacute;il Cabinet led by Brian Cowen effectively proceeded to party around the country in celebration of achieving office.  I say this simply to highlight the differences between certain kinds of reality.  There were things to celebrate.  The country was richer than ever before and yet this appearance of riches and wealth was built completely on sand, particularly the model whereby people borrowed too much in order to pay for houses and to finance business ventures.<\/p><p>One does not need to be an economist to figure out that the way economics measures different things is highly inadequate.  As accountants say about a balance sheet, it is literally a moment in time.  When that moment passed, those economists and, in particular, various bankers used to come into this House used to say &quot;Ah, but the fundamentals are sound&quot; while the country fell apart around us.  We had lost the capacity to explain, by means of normal economics, what was happening.  Some time later, we could count the 330,000 people who lost their jobs but, of course, that was not done by the Department of Finance but by the lowlier Department of Social Protection because it did not have particular access to economic insights or economic control.  Joseph Stiglitz, who used to - perhaps he still does - hold a part-time lecturing position in UCD, is a very distinguished American economist.  In his very important book <i>The Price of Inequality<\/i>, which was published during those years, he used Ireland as a model on several occasions.  He was sympathetic to the fact that our social welfare system, as with those of most other European countries, is completely redistributive.  Without our social welfare system here, up to 60% of the Irish population probably would have fallen into deep poverty - that is, fallen off the cliff - as a consequence of the collapse.  Instead, through redistributive transfers via the social welfare system, the levels of poverty hardly increased.  In fact, Fianna F&aacute;il had a fantastic economic argument in those days.  It argued that if 300,000 people lost their jobs, society became more equal because the incomes of these people went down.  The theory was that as a result- and one can figure it out by simple arithmetic - society became more equal because there were fewer people who were in the middle levels and were either somewhat better off or better off.  This is the difficulty with economic analysis and it is why economists are often referred to as being two-handed - on the one hand and on the other hand.  If they had three or four hands, they would keep going - all to offer different options but never to make decisions themselves.  In respect of accounting, which to some extent economics is about, Joseph Stiglitz said that people in countries around the world now know that GDP <i>per capita<\/i>does not provide a good picture of what is happening to most citizens and how the economy is doing.<\/p><p>The front page of the business section of today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>leads with a story about the ESRI calling for new national accounts to cope with multinational distortions.  Kieran McQuinn, the head of the ESRI, suggested that the growth figures we have just seen are effectively a product of the extreme distortion of our national statistics by perhaps ten to 20 highly profitable multinational companies.  I think we mostly all know the companies in question.  The ESRI suggests that the real figure would be something like half of the suggested figure and that, in the future, real growth figures, as experienced by people across Ireland, would be in the order of 3% or 4% and not in the order of the 7% or 8% the current figures give as our answer to the question of how we are doing as a country.  Trying to reach an agreement on how to count, be it from an economic or accounting point of view, is very important because it is on that basis that this country can borrow, which we need to do to be able to do in order to invest in all of the different areas in capital investment we need.  It is on this basis that businesses will invest and employ so they need a reliable measure because they need to be able to make their economic decisions.  Nonetheless, the system is inherently faulty.<\/p><p>During my time as Minister for Social Protection, I had many meetings with the ESRI because, together with the Department of Employment Affairs Social Protection, it carries out the only work in this area and has been doing so for some time.  That is the social impact assessment that is carried out shortly after every budget to find out in broad social terms who are the likely winners and losers in the budget.  That is based on the simulating welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, model.  The ESRI and people like Tim Callan acknowledge that this model is quite flawed.  It is an attempt to measure in a way that does take into account factors such as how different sectors in society are doing.  Lone parents and their children, particularly lone parents with some work, did particularly well out of the budgets of 2014, 2015 and 2016, especially the latter two, because family income supplement was increased very significantly.  However, it is very difficult to capture that in the context of the way economic counting is done.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>I welcome the attempt to find a way of identifying genuine progress indicators, which is a good and reasonable objective.  However, I am sceptical about how easy this is to explain.  I will not repeat the stories here, but Lyndon Johnson, the former American President, had some great comments about politicians talking about economics and by and large he advised them not to do it.  It is a nerdy science and a dismal science.  It requires from politicians something close to the patience of Job to listen to it in detail and to try to marry it to the programmes that politicians want which is usually about building new schools, new roads, expanding ports and increasing the well-being of society.<\/p> <p> The other issue we need to address is as follows.  I will finish on this simple example.  We have the switch model in which it is not possible to include, for instance, the value of a medical card.  Many economists might not know in detail how important a medical card can be to a family.  Irrespective of the side of the political spectrum they come from, almost everybody in this House understands the significance of a medical card.  Does a person with an income of &euro;10,000 without a medical card have the same wealth as another person with &euro;10,000 in income but who has a medical card?  The models are exactly the same, but in practice most of us in this House know that there is an important difference.  That is the problem with our current measurement system.  Irrespective of whether it is something very large or something very small, such as the impact on a household of a medical card, we are not at the moment able to measure it.<\/p> <p> Deputy Howlin's proposal goes some way to trying to address some of these issues.  I wish the Bill well.  I would love to see it happening, but I think it may be a while yet before it does.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200032#HH00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521732000,"counter":385,"content":"<p>I am very pleased to be able to support this Bill presented by the Labour Party and to reflect on some of its provisions.  This legislation represents exactly the type of reform we should be looking to make to our public services.<\/p>  <p>  I will start with a couple of personal anecdotes that reflect my perspective.  I studied business studies in UCD in the early 1980s.  On my first day my first class on macroeconomics was given by a man called Dessie Norton.  In a big theatre like this Chamber, he started out by saying, \"Remember this, boys and girls, and don't ever forget it.  The first law, the first assumption upon which everything is built is that people are profit maximisers.  All our rules and laws after that extend out.\"  I did not realise that at the time I was getting what Kate Raworth has described as the classic economics education which has been set in stone almost for 50 or 60 years and which is still there to the current day even in the supposed best economic schools.  I remember as an 18 or 19 year old thinking in my heart of hearts that that was too simple an assumption.  It did not describe me: I was not just a profit maximiser.  Throughout my life working in the business world and elsewhere my experience has been that we have had a real difficulty in that economic analysis is too narrow.  The assumptions on which it is built are false because they start off with some of those flawed assumptions.<\/p>  <p>  I will give a second personal reflection.  During the depths of the crash we experienced almost ten years ago, someone using the advice of John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, said in the course of the banking collapse that the first thing we needed to do was to stabilise, but we then needed to reform.  We have done the stabilisation bit.  We are beyond it and are now back in Celtic tiger boom years with 7% growth.  However, we have not done the reform or certainly not to the extent we could and should.  I refer to reform in the biggest sense of a completely different form of economics.  It is not just the indicators we need to change: our core understanding of economics needs to change and beyond that politics.<\/p>  <p>  I recently saw a video by George Monbiot, the British journalist, environmentalist and labour activist, which took a very broad approach.  He asked, \"What is the story in politics in our modern world?\"  He said that for 30 or 40 years after the Second World War the story was a social democratic one with big government providing services and protecting people against big bad businesses.  For a variety of reasons that changed in the winter of discontent and the crisis of confidence, as the former US President, Jimmy Carter, called it, in the late 1970s.  It became a different story in that markets would deliver what we wanted and would protect us from big bad government, which was seen as not the order of the day.  Strangely the social democrats became the greatest disciples of that orthodoxy.  People such as Tony Blair with his third way accepted the mantra that markets knew best and that one would have to let capital free to deliver the services we want.  That, as an economic orthodoxy and a political orthodoxy, the Washington consensus, was there right through to 2008, but it is no longer credible.<\/p>  <p>  Based on conventional economics, who could have believed that we would be printing money at scale, as we have done for the last ten years, and still have no inflation?  The whole discipline of economics is in a crisis of confidence.  Those outside have no confidence in it and those inside must be wondering what, in God's name, was the purpose of all those lessons they learnt because none of it seems to make sense anymore.<\/p>  <p>  We need a new economics that knows how to value natural capital, which economics has never done.  We need to put a price on the externalities that take place in our current industrial business system.  I support this legislation because it addresses one element of that.  We need to change our assumptions, some of the algorithms and the basic nature of economics.  However, part of the shift is changing what we measure.  I commend the Labour Party on trying to do this in the Bill it has brought to the House.  We also looked at this briefly at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  As well as through this legislation, we need to use that committee to try to bring it into effect.<\/p>  <p>  Earlier I spoke about the nature of reform.  This is a reforming D&aacute;il.  We have the potential to make real reform and we have achieved some of it.  That we were able to establish the Parliamentary Budget Office signalled a huge advance in the workings of this Parliament.  It has not really kicked in yet: we will only see the benefit in five, ten or 15 years.  In this reforming process we have not exactly had huge support from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance, which may be slightly caught in an old economics view of the world.  That they for so long questioned the need for or the approval of a budget oversight office - indeed we have people here who were very involved in the process - shows that they were out of date with where the new economy needs to go.  However, we have it now.<\/p>  <p>  I suggested in the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that we should meet officials from the CSO to discuss this very issue.  I have read the Minister of State's speech and I understand his perspective on the legal, administrative and other difficulties with changing the nature of our national accounts given the need to adhere to EUROSTAT rules and so on.<\/p><p>I think that we should, as a country, push to do the best we can to be part of the new economy.  Our position in the world is very fraught because we have Brexit and Trump.  I do not think we should do what I fear the Taoiseach did in Washington last week, which is to cling on to the old Washington consensus or indeed Donald Trump's warped economic nationalist version of it.  We have to go to the Brexit talks or indeed to dealing with Donald Trump's administration with certain values and we have to stand for something.  We have to stand for this new economic view of the world, one which recognises that we need globalisation but it cannot be a race to the bottom.  It has to be fair.  There have to be fair labour laws and environmental standards.  The very nature of how we measure progress should change towards a sustainable economic model in every way.<\/p> <p> I would like to see the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and our own Parliamentary Budget Office going into some of the details of this.  I think it is very much justified.  Time spent on that would be very valid and we should tease out how whatever the concerns the Department has can be resolved and how we could make this real.  We should make it real in the sense that it does not just affect statistics or national accounts but decision-making about where we go from here.  The outcome is that it changes our budget decision-making process.  It changes our whole industrial and enterprise policy, which may then become less reliant on just foreign direct investment, growth at all costs numbers games where we say that we are doing great because our economy is growing by a certain percentage and then find that we have another burst bubble three to five years later.  This should develop towards a leap to a new economic model which manages the natural resource constraints that we have and gives us greater stability.  It should not put us as we are increasingly seen in the world, as a low corporate tax location, as opting out on climate and being seen as a bit too cute in every way in the way that we gain from the international economic system at present.  We should be seen as a leading, responsible country, developing new economics that bring poor countries out of poverty, that protect our standard of living, that use the transition to go towards a more equal distribution of wealth in our country and others and that set certain standards.  One measures those standards by the sort of indicators that are set out here.  I would like to see us doing that.  I would like to see this legislation passed and, if it is not possible for us to pass it, for us to go into the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and to use the Parliamentary Budget Office to take this work further.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200033#JJ00200","speaker":"1294","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":387,"content":"<p>It is always a good debate when we are looking into the future and not always looking at the past and what was not done right.  I get a sense that people want to develop new pastures and new ground.  I welcome the contributions in that regard.  An overarching thing that I have learned in my position, having met with officials from the CSO, is that they value their independence.  That independence allows them to do and make work plans.  That does not mean that they construct the material.  They have said that they are interested in meeting with stakeholders.  I am sure that they are listening to this debate today and what Deputies have had to say.  Maybe there are other areas that we could look at.<\/p>  <p>  Deputy Broughan advocated what is happening outside the CSO, for example, the benefits of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and its good work, which Deputy Ryan alluded to, which is a consequence of new politics in this House.  There is also the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council which the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, would be very familiar with as well.  There are the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Parliamentary Budget Office, as well as civil society.  Deputy Broughan mentioned Social Justice Ireland and the good work that it does.  We have many bodies, think-tanks, statisticians and people doing analysis.  It is up to the Government to govern and make decisions on the back of that.  That was the fundamental basis for the development of the ten year capital programme, the 2040 plan - statistics, where people will be living, where industries will be, where roads and railways are needed and where interconnectivity is.  It is working towards the future.  Deputy Burton talked about history lessons and certain kinds of reality and measurements relating to the medical card.  That is something that can be explored.  I am sure the CSO would have no issue with that.  Deputy Ryan talked about sitting down with the CSO.  I encourage everybody in this House to sit down with it.  It is available and happy to do so.<\/p>  <p>  Given the time constraints that we all have here with the firefighting work that we do, we should still endeavour to have that time set aside to look at proactive work.  The National Statistics Board is doing much of the work that there is a suggestion to do within primary legislation.  Will there be overlap, cross-pollination and is it necessary to look at redeveloping a primary legislative wheel within legislation that is primarily independent?  With regard to Deputy Cassells' issues, he had a caveat.  He talked about protecting the independence and supporting what Deputy Howlin was bringing forward, but he was also talking about transport and the needs of transportation for his own constituency in County Meath with increased population.  We have all the data relating to or through our census and it is that data which the CSO analyses and about which it is very circumspect.<\/p>  <p>  I believe that it is always important to have the debate on this and to talk about doing new things in a new way.  In a week when we were talking about blurred lines relating to independence and independence of government, it is a little ironic that we are here having a debate where we have a completely independent Secretary General and CSO and are looking at deviating from that independence in some way.  That being said, I am not being mischievous about that.  I am just thinking of all the different inputs here.  It reminds me of a fellow from my own neck of the woods.

When all is said and done, there is much more said than done.  Sometimes we are good at talking the talk in this House but there is the matter of implementation.  We have statisticians and people in the requisite offices to do the work.  They will not be looking to next October, February or the following October to another general election, or maybe even in two to three years' time-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200034#KK00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":388,"content":"<p>It will be sometime.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200034#KK00300","speaker":"1371"},{"type":"speech","time":1521732600,"counter":389,"content":"<p>If they are going to be subject to new Governments coming in, primary legislation, new work plans and trying to develop their own, I do not think it would be a good thing.

Very instructive things were said.  I am very disappointed in the Minister of State's response.  I say this as somebody who was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for more than five years.  I know that Ministers get scripts, come in here and read the scripts.  The Minister of State's second intervention was more thoughtful.  I believe that we need to think fundamentally differently.  The notion that, somehow, it is not our role to do that is quite shocking and it is not acceptable to me.  The Bill is primarily a social and economic Bill.  The Minister of State's original speech was a legal and administrative rebuttal.  We are the lawmakers.  If there are legal impediments to things that we need to do, we change them and move them out of the way.  To say that administratively they are too busy doing other things is not an argument at all.  We determine the priorities of the agencies of the State.<\/p><p>The most serious disagreement I have had with the Minister is on the notion of independence.  I have dealt very closely with the CSO because its figures determined whether we got the money drawdowns.  It is completely independent.  I did not always agree with some of its assessments and we had very robust discussions about them.  I would preserve its independence absolutely.  I refer to its statistical independence which the Bill does not suggest would be altered one whit.  It certainly should not be independent to determine what it should measure.  We are the policy makers; we determine what tools we need to make policy.  Its job, when we tell it what should be measured, is to do it objectively and independently.  It is a complete canard to talk about an intrusion on its independence.  The people who crafted the speech for the Minister of State know that.<br\/><br\/>I will focus on some of the points made by Deputy Ryan.  I strongly agree with him.  We need to move away.  It is convenient - I was that soldier - for a variety of different groups, including voluntary groups, social justice groups and survey groups to be doing all this work because it is not official.  It does not have the same status of the measurement of economic growth.  We do not allow <i>ad hoc<\/i>groups to measure our economic growth or our unemployment statistics.  We do that ourselves because they are critical and we regard them as critical.  The measurements I am suggesting now are equally critical and should not be disregarded.<br\/><br\/>I was tempted when I heard the original speech to reflect on the immortal phrase of Oscar Wilde that nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  We know the price of everything and the value of nothing.  Deputy Louise O'Reilly talked about Bhutan measuring a happiness indicator.  Contentment is a result of a variety of things.  It is not exclusively the result of wealth or growth.  In my initial contribution I asked what growth is for if not to add to the sum of happiness or well-being of the people.  It has to be for a purpose.  Deputy Ryan would argue that the following of growth for itself is absolutely a destructive model.  I have to mention one difference.  I would not always defend Tony Blair but the notion he was a pure defender of the capitalist system is more than a tad unfair.  He was a very strong advocate of regulated capitalism.  Our problem in the last decade is that capitalism globalised but the regulation of capital did not.  That is why I am an internationalist and believe in institutions like the European Union and OECD, to regulate capital.  I believe that on issues like corporate taxation we need a global response, not an individual or regional response.  We need to have a global response to the issue of mobile capital in the world.<br\/><br\/>I ask the Minister of State to think again.  I am very conscious that Bills are introduced with an alacrity such that they are like trains coming, three a week, and Governments have to knock them back as best they can.  The Minister of State talked about the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  At least three of us in the House were involved in the reform committee and trying to get that done was like pushing a boulder up a hill.  The people pushing it the other way were my former colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, among others.  If they were not pushing it back down, they were not exactly facilitating its upward trajectory.  That is a reality.  There is an inertia in terms of reform in the real sense.  That is why when we walked across the threshold of Government in 2011, both Fine Gael and Labour had done the analysis and established a new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because we had to balance the books.  I listened to people describe that Government as an austerity Government.  When income falls by a third and one is trying to maintain expenditure at a level a third greater than income, any household will say there is a problem.  Our discernment was we needed not only to balance the books so we could afford to maintain the infrastructure of the State but that we also needed reform.  A very significant process of reform was undertaken, not all of it visible.  My real concern now is that the reform focus has diminished and will disappear entirely.  Maybe even the Department will disappear entirely as we get back to normal activity as if reform was not required on a permanent basis.  I urge the Minister very strongly to think again.<br\/><br\/>Something like over 200 Bills have passed Second Stage.  In this state of limbo that is new politics, it is becoming a joke.  It is a very serious joke for the 200 Bills, many of which are worth enacting, although some are not.  They all deserve to be processed through to the end.  There is a notion we should let everything pass.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party and the Labour Party will support the Bill and it will pass Second Stage, whatever the Minister of State's view is but that is not good enough.  It is an important issue which we need to embrace and I hope the Minister of State will so we can at least have a debate on these issues and not say it has been done by the oversight committee or IFAC or somebody else.  Let us as a House determine we want a different set of indicators and see how we can progress it.  I will happily give my energies to the committee system to try to advance it.  I ask the Minister of State to give it further consideration and hopefully goodwill when it comes to be voted upon next week.<br\/><br\/>I will address a remark to the Ceann Comhairle.  I have genuine concerns that when we pass legislation here on Second Stage, it has to mean something.  When we pass resolutions, as we did earlier today, the Government might not like the instruction of the House, for example the instruction to abolish the strategic communications unit.  If the formal resolution of the House has as much meaning and impact as a show of hands at a debating society in one of our colleges, we are in a very dangerous place because it was never the case until this D&aacute;il.  If the core and essence of new politics is to take power back to this assembly and rebalance the power of the Executive, it will be meaningless, very destructive and undermining of this place if the Executive can simply say it will ignore it all.  They are really important issues we have to address.  I say it in the full understanding of the pressure on the Executive.  I say this as a small party in Opposition: it might be the case that we have too many Bills coming through.  We might need to have a better filtration system and we are considering that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200034#KK00500","speaker":"1353","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1521733200,"counter":392,"content":"<p>Dunning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200035#LL00200","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1521733200,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Pardon me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200035#LL00300","speaker":"1353"},{"type":"speech","time":1521733200,"counter":394,"content":"<p>Dunning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018032200035#LL00400","speaker":"1290"},{"type":"speech","time":1521733200,"counter":395,"content":"<p>I do not agree with his system but let us discuss it.
