Through ongoing recourse to that dialogue process, I believe that retired public servants and their representatives can be confident that their pension concerns will receive full and proper consideration as they have done in the past.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700064#WRA05400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Office of Public Works","counter":56,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700064#WRA05500"},{"type":"question","counter":57,"qnumday":71,"qnumall":"[49192\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700064#WRA05600","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the plans of the OPW to purchase property for State organisations in counties Cavan and Monaghan; the stages in negotiation for each; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1271","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":58,"content":"<p>As the question refers to matters which would be commercially sensitive, the Office of Public Works is unable to comment on any such plans.\u00a0 Details of properties which are purchased for State organisations are normally made public when purchases have been completed.\u00a0Generally when OPW is seeking to acquire a property or site it will trawl the market and advertise publicly.

I am deeply concerned by the continued high level of violence, and by reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, which perpetuate the crisis and impact negatively on its scale.<\/p>  <p>  The current conflict began in 2013 and has had devastating consequences for civilians. The war, compounded by drought, has led to severe food insecurity and caused massive population displacement and suffering throughout the country, with women and girls suffering the most.  More than 400,000 people have died and an estimated 7 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance.<\/p>  <p>  On 12 September last, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, signed a peace agreement with the opposition.  While this peace agreement has the potential to mark a new departure, it is critical that South Sudan&rsquo;s leaders implement it without delay.  Achieving lasting peace will require sustained effort and commitment as well as a genuinely inclusive approach to building the future South Sudan.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland strongly supports efforts to build peace in South Sudan. In November 2017, during his visit to Addis Ababa, the T&aacute;naiste met representatives of IGAD (Intergovernmental Authority on Development) and the African Union to discuss the situation in South Sudan.  On that visit, the T&aacute;naiste announced funding to the IGAD High Level Revitalization Forum, the process which delivered the revised peace agreement. Ireland will continue to support IGAD&rsquo;s work on monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the agreement in 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Our Embassy in Addis Ababa, which is accredited to South Sudan, monitors the situation and engages with local, regional and international parties on an ongoing basis.  The Irish Ambassador in Addis Ababa visits Juba frequently where she meets with key government, UN, NGO, Red Cross and diplomatic partners, including the EU Delegation.  Our Ambassador plans to visit again this week.<\/p>  <p>  We are committed to supporting efforts towards peace in South Sudan and have contributed to projects aimed at peacebuilding. In 2018, this has included supporting partners&rsquo; meditation efforts and empowering civil society, in particular women&rsquo;s groups, to facilitate their engagement in peace processes.<\/p>  <p>  As well as our direct bilateral support, we are actively involved in the efforts of the EU to support peace in South Sudan.  Two officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been seconded to the EU Delegation in South Sudan, including one as head of Mission. The EU Delegation is strongly supportive of the peace process, in particular by providing support to the implementing and monitoring bodies of the peace agreement. The T&aacute;naiste discussed these efforts with the EU Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Alexander Rondos, when he visited Dublin on 7 November.<\/p>  <p>  While a sustained resolution to the conflict is the ultimate goal, we have a duty now to deal with immediate humanitarian needs. Since 2012, Ireland has provided &euro;61 million in direct humanitarian assistance to South Sudan. Over &euro;10 million in Irish funding has been provided so far this year, including to Irish NGOs to assist them in reaching the most vulnerable. Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Oxfam, Tr&oacute;caire and World Vision, with support from Irish Aid, are working in partnership with local organisations and NGO networks to provide lifesaving supplies to meet the basic needs of those suffering from the conflict.<\/p>  <p>  As well as this direct bilateral aid, Ireland has also contributed significantly to humanitarian support in South Sudan through the multilateral system. Ireland is a significant contributor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund, which has allocated $187 million to alleviate the crisis in South Sudan since 2011, as well as to the EU, which has provided more than &euro;90 million so far this year.<\/p>  <p>  With humanitarian needs likely to remain acute in 2019, Irish funding will continue to support both those in need inside South Sudan as well as South Sudanese refugees in neighbouring countries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700066#WRC05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1241"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Brexit Supports","counter":202,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700067#WRD00300"},{"type":"question","counter":203,"qnumday":120,"qnumall":"[49092\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700067#WRD00400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the costs associated with the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready forums in tabular form including events due to take place over the coming weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":204,"qnumday":121,"qnumall":"[49093\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700067#WRD00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the advertisement agencies that have been secured by his Department to promote the Getting Ireland Brexit Ready forums and other Government Brexit-related promotional material across print media, broadcast media and online media; the costs associated with the use of such agencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"question","counter":205,"qnumday":122,"qnumall":"[49094\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700067#WRD00600","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the media budget allocated for promoting Government-related Brexit events and supports; the budget allocated for print media, broadcast media and online media, including publically funded and commercial media in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1221","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":206,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 to 122, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>Since my appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in June 2017, I have overseen and co-ordinated a sustained intensification of Brexit preparedness and contingency planning across Government. <\/p><p>As part of these efforts, the Government is organising &ldquo;Getting Ireland Brexit Ready&rdquo; public information events around Ireland to inform and advise about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources that the Government has put in place.<\/p><p>These events bring together over a dozen Agencies and their parent Departments &ndash; the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - under one roof to inform and advise both citizens and businesses about Brexit preparedness and the range of support measures and resources the Government has put in place.<\/p><p>Five Getting Ireland Brexit Ready workshop events have so far taken place in Cork on 5 October, Galway on 12 October, Monaghan 19 October, Dublin on 25 October, and Limerick on 23 November.

The conflict was sparked, more than seven years ago, by brutal repression of dissent by the Assad regime. The conduct of the conflict, including the use of chemical weapons and medieval &ldquo;starve or surrender&rdquo; tactics, is estimated to have cost the lives of over 400,000 people. It has led to a situation in which 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region.<\/p>  <p>  Sanctions are a tool which the international community may use to put political pressure on those who commit violence against their own people. Targeted EU sanctions are in place against people and entities that are complicit in the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria. The first person on this EU list is Bashar Al Assad, whose brutal pursuit of this conflict, neglecting all opportunities to seek a political solution, has led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. There are numerous barriers to humanitarian access in Syria as a result of actions by the parties to the conflict, particularly the Assad regime. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the Assad regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. <\/p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s Basic Principles on the Use of Restrictive Measures state that &ldquo;Sanctions should be targeted in a way that has maximum impact on those whose behaviour we want to influence. Targeting should reduce to the maximum extent possible any adverse humanitarian effects or unintended consequences for persons not targeted &hellip;.&rdquo; Accordingly, the EU&rsquo;s Syria sanctions include specific exemptions for essential civilian needs and for humanitarian assistance. Ireland has been a consistent advocate for ensuring such exemptions are included.<\/p>  <p>  In line with the EU strategy on Syria, the EU is maintaining its restrictive measures against the Syrian regime and its supporters as long as the repression of civilians continues. To repeal these sanctions could be misconstrued as tacit acquiescence in the actions of the Assad regime and therefore serve to encourage a belief in impunity with regard to attacks on civilians, and disregard for the UN-led peace process. <\/p>  <p>  The EU does however keep the impact of sanctions under constant review, and will consider options to mitigate any unintended consequences which can be documented as relating directly to the measures themselves, as distinct from the more general economic disruption caused by the conflict. The relevant working groups in Brussels propose options to address any unintended negative impacts where they are identified. <\/p>  <p>  For example, in 2016 the EU amended the Syria sanctions regime to make it easier for NGOs operating in Syria to buy fuel. In 2017, EU Member States including Ireland consulted with NGOs to identify any further difficulties they were experiencing in carrying out humanitarian work in Syria that may have been linked to the sanctions. Based on the feedback of the NGOs, the European Commission published a Frequently Asked Questions document to clarify certain provisions of the sanctions identified as unclear by NGOs, as well as the humanitarian exemptions and derogations. In April of this year, EU Member States reviewed best practice guidelines on humanitarian exemptions, with a view to facilitating the work of NGOs responding to humanitarian crises, including the crisis in Syria. I welcome the ongoing work to implement the findings of previous reviews.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700067#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":235,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700068#WRE00400"},{"type":"question","counter":236,"qnumday":139,"qnumall":"[49397\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700068#WRE00500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"his views on the conviction of persons (details supplied) for the murder of a person; if he will lobby the criminal cases review commission for the case to be considered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1259","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":237,"content":"<p>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.

Already, vulnerable people and communities in the least developed countries, in particular women and children, are struggling to cope with the consequences of erratic weather patterns.  Additionally, an increasing number of severe weather events is putting response systems and communities under strain.    Through Ireland&rsquo;s official overseas assistance programme, Irish Aid, funding is provided for climate adaptation and mitigation activities, particularly in least developed countries. This funding consists of contributions to multilateral organisations, grants to NGOs, and programmes implemented through our Embassies. <\/p>  <p>  In 2016, the Programme for Government committed Ireland to spending &euro;175m in climate finance to 2020.

All receipts from betting duty go to the Exchequer. <\/p>  <p>  The rate of betting duty at 1 per cent on the amount of bets wagered in Ireland is at an all-time low, and betting duty receipts are exceptionally low when compared to other sectors subject to excise taxes.

The main focus of the sector's engagement during this consultation was to oppose any increase in the betting duty, which leaves me with few options in this regard other than to impose a straight forward increase in the current regime. <\/p>  <p>  We must acknowledge the raised public consciousness of the problem of gambling in society. While problem gambling can result in the problem gambler, and their family, bearing the severest of economic and of course personal costs, the social costs of problem gambling can extend to their employers and to public institutions in the health, welfare and justice systems, such costs ultimately borne by taxpayers. This needs to be better reflected within the betting duty regime. <\/p>  <p>  The Government fully accepts that the issue of problem gambling is a serious one that needs to be addressed. Earlier this year the Government approved the drafting of a new general scheme of a Gambling Control Bill which will provide for a strengthened regulatory framework for the wider gambling sector. My colleague, Minister of State Stanton, has stated that a key element of the proposed new Gambling Control legislation is that it would permit the establishment and operation of a social fund supported by industry levies, further that such a fund will support those professional expert organisations involved in addiction treatment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700068#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Collection","counter":260,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700068#WRE02900"},{"type":"question","counter":261,"qnumday":148,"qnumall":"[48863\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700068#WRE03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 59 of 19 September 2018, the way in which tax (details supplied) that has been deducted in the UK will be reflected here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":262,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that in the case at hand, it appears from the information provided so far that tax may have been deducted from this taxpayer&rsquo;s pension in the United Kingdom in contravention of the Double Taxation Convention (&ldquo;the Convention&rdquo;) between Ireland and the United Kingdom of 1976. <\/p>  <p>  Double Taxation Conventions allocate taxing rights between Contracting States.

It replaces a pre-existing, more narrowly focused exit charge that was designed as an anti-avoidance measure following the identification of a number of transactions whereby Irish companies migrated their residence to avoid the charge to Irish Capital Gains Tax, disposed of an asset, and then subsequently migrated back into the State.<\/p>  <p>  The new ATAD-compliant exit tax is a broad-based measure and it is expected that in time it will give rise to Exchequer revenue.  However the nature of the charge is such that it will arise on occasional, stand-alone transactions &ndash; a charge will arise where a company migrates residence while holding assets, or transfers assets abroad, such that the assets leave the Irish tax net, in cases where those assets have increased in value and therefore hold an unrealised gain. <\/p>  <p>  An estimation of the future recurring annual yield would require predicting future changes in asset values, in addition to projections as to future restructuring of companies.

There is no exemption or relief from USC and PRSI is payable where the individual is not liable to social insurance contributions in the home country. <\/p><p>It should also be noted that individuals who benefit from SARP make a substantial contribution to the exchequer in terms of income tax, USC and PRSI which would not otherwise arise if these individuals were not located in Ireland.<\/p><p>The existence of an incentive like SARP is an acknowledgement that we are competing on a global basis for highly skilled and mobile executives.  Given the mobility of these individuals, and the existence of similar assignee schemes in competitor jurisdictions, it is possible that if SARP was abolished these individuals would not have chosen to locate in Ireland.  <\/p><p>The 2016 annual Revenue report on SARP shows that for the years 2012 to 2016 (the most recent year for which data are available) the costs of the measure were as follows:<table><tr><th>Tax Cost2012 <\/th><th>Tax Cost2013 <\/th><th>Tax Cost 2014 <\/th><th>Tax Cost2015 <\/th><th>Tax Cost2016 <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;0.1 million<\/td><td>&euro;1.9 million<\/td><td>&euro;5.9 million<\/td><td>&euro;9.5 million<\/td><td>&euro;18.1 million<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>In relation to the &euro;18.1 million tax cost for 2016, it is also worth noting that SARP directly generated 793 jobs in that year, which resulted in a very significant tax contribution to the exchequer. Employers also reported that an extra 477 employees had been employed by their companies in 2016, and 607 employees retained by companies in 2016 for which the exchequer benefited directly from additional tax from these associated jobs retained and created through SARP.  <\/p><p>In terms of the Deputy's question, it is not clear that there would be any net savings to the Exchequer if the programme was abolished. On the contrary, it may well be the case that there could be a net loss to the Exchequer arising from such a move.  As the Deputy is aware, only a proportion of income is disregarded for income tax purposes under SARP and the majority of a person's income remains liable to taxation.  Also, as already indicated, USC applies on the full amount of the person's income.  It is unclear what proportion of SARP beneficiaries, if any, might remain in the jurisdiction if the measure was withdrawn.  Furthermore, such a withdrawal would inevitably have implications for the numbers of SARP-related jobs that would be created in the future and, by extension, the tax revenues that would be associated with those jobs.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, I recently brought forward an amendment to the Finance Bill 2018 to place a ceiling on eligible income for SARP recipients at &euro;1 million.  This change will be effective for new entrants to the programme from 1 January 2019 and for existing beneficiaries of the programme from 1 January 2020.  In addition, I announced that a full review of SARP will be carried out in 2019.  I expect that this exercise will, among other things, afford an opportunity to examine in greater detail the issues raised in the Deputy's question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Reliefs Application","counter":298,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02200"},{"type":"question","counter":299,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[48985\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if recommendations by an organisation (details supplied) will be examined; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":300,"content":"<p>As part of the annual Budgetary and Finance Bill process, all taxes, reliefs and exemptions are subject to on-going review. The Department of Finance produces a TSG paper annually on Capital Taxes.  This year's Capital Taxes TSG paper, which can be found at<i><\/i><\/p><p><i>, examined options to change both the CGT rate and the lifetime limit for the Revised Entrepreneur Relief. <\/i><\/p><p>Most recent estimates indicate that in the absence of behavioural change each 1% reduction in the rate of CGT was estimated to reduce yield by approximately &euro;36m annually, while the cost to increase the lifetime limit for Revised Entrepreneur Relief to &euro;5m or &euro;15m was estimated at approximately &euro;39m and &euro;50m respectively. <\/p><p>Whilst all taxes are subject to ongoing review, you will appreciate that all policy choices with respect to changes in taxation are made from both a broader policy perspective and in the context of the financial resources available.  In light of this, I decided not to amend the rate of Capital Gains Tax or the Revised Entrepreneur Relief as part of Budget 2019, however these matters will again be subject to review during preparations for Budget 2020.<\/p><p>In relation to R&amp;amp;D Tax Credits, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that in putting together a claim for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, companies must have regard to two interlocking parts: the claim must pass the science test (i.e. is the activity a qualifying activity) and the accounting test must be satisfied (i.e. is the amount of the claim correct).  Revenue inform me that they have detailed R&amp;amp;D guidance on the operation of the R&amp;amp;D tax credit, for all companies, which is designed to remove some of the uncertainty that companies may have. Furthermore, Revenue advise me that they are currently working on guidance in relation to the level of records that they would expect to see to support a claim for the R&amp;amp;D tax credit.  It is their expectation that this new guidance will give all companies greater certainty in advance of submitting a claim for relief.<\/p><p>In February 2017 Revenue issued guidance aimed specifically at micro and small companies, to reduce the administrative burden on SMEs while also ensuring that the credit is granted to bona fide R&amp;amp;D. The aim of this guidance was to give these smaller companies greater clarity on how they could demonstrate to Revenue that their R&amp;amp;D tax credit claim satisfied the &ldquo;science test&rdquo;. Where a company spends &euro;200,000 on activities which Enterprise Ireland have looked at and confirmed as R&amp;amp;D, then in most cases Revenue will accept that those activities pass the science test. Revenue may still review that the accounting test has been satisfied. <\/p><p>As Revenue engage independent, case specific, experts where there is uncertainty in respect of whether or not the activities are qualifying R&amp;amp;D activities, any pre-approval would out of necessity be cumbersome and slow, potentially acting as a barrier to companies carrying out R&amp;amp;D.  In respect of the accounting test, it is not possible to judge if an amount will be incurred in carrying on R&amp;amp;D until that R&amp;amp;D is actually carried out and that amount is actually incurred.  As such, in addition to the difficulty of putting in place pre-approval in relation to the science test, it is not possible to put in place a pre-approval process for the accounting test. <\/p><p>Finally, Revenue advise me that all R&amp;amp;D claims are currently dealt with by their Medium Enterprises Division or Large Cases Division.  There is an internal network of experienced R&amp;amp;D auditors from those divisions who meet and share their experiences.  Revenue also engage with external stakeholders through the Tax Administration Liaison Committee (TALC), where there is a specific sub-group which looks at R&amp;amp;D issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Credits","counter":301,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02500"},{"type":"question","counter":302,"qnumday":163,"qnumall":"[49007\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02600","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost of increasing the personal tax credit for the single, married, and so on credit by &euro;50, &euro;100, &euro;200, &euro;300, &euro;400 and &euro;500, respectively.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":303,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that costings for increases to personal tax credits can be found in the table on page 6 of the Revenue Ready Reckoner which is available on the Revenue website: <i>. <\/i><\/p><p>While some of the costs of the increases sought by the Deputy are not displayed in the Ready Reckoner, they can be estimated on a straight-line or pro-rata basis from the costs shown. <\/p><p>For ease of reference, the estimated costings sought by the Deputy, and calculated on the basis of the Ready Reckoner, are set out in the tables below:<table><tr><th>Personal Tax Credit -   Single<\/th><th>Cost First Year &euro;m<\/th><th>Cost Full Year &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,700<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>46<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,750<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,850<\/td><td>160<\/td><td>184<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,950<\/td><td>240<\/td><td>276<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,050<\/td><td>320<\/td><td>368<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,150<\/td><td>400<\/td><td>460<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Personal Tax Credit -   Married<\/th><th>Cost First Year &euro;m<\/th><th>Cost Full Year &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,350<\/td><td>32.25<\/td><td>37.75<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,400<\/td><td>64.5<\/td><td>75.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,500<\/td><td>129<\/td><td>151<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,600<\/td><td>193.5<\/td><td>226.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,700<\/td><td>258<\/td><td>302<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;3,800<\/td><td>322.5<\/td><td>377.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Widowed Person or surviving Civil Partner (without qualifying child) Credit<\/th><th>Cost First Year &euro;m<\/th><th>Cost Full Year &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,240<\/td><td>2.95<\/td><td>3.5<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,290<\/td><td>5.9<\/td><td>7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,390<\/td><td>11.8<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,490<\/td><td>17.7<\/td><td>21<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,590<\/td><td>23.6<\/td><td>28<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,690<\/td><td>29.5<\/td><td>35<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><table><tr><th>Single Person Child Carer Tax Credit<\/th><th>Cost First Year &euro;m<\/th><th>Cost Full Year &euro;m<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,700<\/td><td>1.6<\/td><td>1.85<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,750<\/td><td>3.2<\/td><td>3.7<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,850<\/td><td>6.4<\/td><td>7.4<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;1,950<\/td><td>9.6<\/td><td>11.1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,050<\/td><td>12.8<\/td><td>14.8<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>&euro;2,150<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>18.5<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Code","counter":304,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02800"},{"type":"question","counter":305,"qnumday":164,"qnumall":"[49051\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700069#WRF02900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 158 of 13 November 2018, if the date of 1 January 2019 for removal of flat rate expenses is accurate.","asker":"1288","askee":"1292"},{"type":"speech","counter":306,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that their review of the flat rate expenses regime is ongoing and that it is intended to have the review completed by the end of 2019.

However, there is a Revenue concession which allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements (vitamins, minerals and fish oils).

However, this concession is proving to be extremely problematic. <\/p>  <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry has made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to a range of food supplements.  There are concerns that while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% VAT rate.  Their argument is generally that the products concerned are similar and compete with other products that are zero rated.  <\/p>  <p>  There has been protracted correspondence on the issues raised which has raised concerns regarding possible non-compliance in the sector, in particular the zero rating of products that should be standard rated which may result in a degree of unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.  <\/p>  <p>  Revenue&rsquo;s position is that food supplements are not food and, as such, are not entitled under VAT law to the zero rate of VAT; therefore, the standard rate of VAT applies.

The cost will vary depending on whether and to the extent that the taxpayer concerned has taxable income and whether such income is taxable at the standard or marginal rate of income tax. <\/p>  <p>  Allowable expenses for employees, including flat rate expenses, are also claimed through different channels depending on the status of the taxpayer. For some employees, the allowances may be carried forward from year to year and applied automatically through the PAYE system at pay roll level.  For other employees, particularly those in receipt of non-PAYE income, the allowances may be claimed through the annual income tax returns, the Form 11 (which taxpayers within the self assessment system are obliged to complete) or the Form 12 Return of Income. As the Form 11 or Form 12 returns are not required to be returned until 10 months after the year end, returns for the 2017 tax year were only due in November 2018.  Thus, the final position on the cost of flat rate expenses allowances for 2017 cannot be reasonably estimated until full returns data is available and analysed. This will also require analysis of information contained in the 2017 P35 returns by employers of the pay and tax details of employees under the PAYE system, which were due in February 2018.  With late filers, processing of returns and parsing of data, Revenue has advised that complete information on expenses for the 2017 tax year will not be available until mid 2019. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, as I have indicated in response to previous questions on this subject, Revenue&rsquo;s ongoing review of the flat rate expenses regime is expected to be completed by end 2019.

These include:<\/p>  <p>  - Proportionate financial capacity criterion (turnover requirements limited to twice the contract value);<\/p>  <p>  - Contracting Authorities are encouraged to divide public contracts into lots;<\/p>  <p>  - Provision for &ldquo;consortia bidding&rdquo; to assist SMEs to participate in procurement procedures where they would not have the relevant capability or scale; and<\/p>  <p>  - Public bodies are required to advertise contracts for goods and services valued above &euro;25,000 on the national eTenders portal.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my colleague, Minister of State Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, who has responsibility for public procurement, chairs quarterly meetings of an SME Advisory Group, in accordance with the Programme for Government. \u00a0This ensures that the voice of Irish SMEs (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) is heard by Government.<\/p>  <p>  One of the public procurement options available to Government is\u00a0PPP,\u00a0which\u00a0offers an alternative model for delivering infrastructure that can be effective in particular circumstances.\u00a0 The Report of the PPP Review, published earlier this year, noted the role that PPPs have played in delivering much needed infrastructure in recent years, particularly during\u00a0times when\u00a0Exchequer funding was constrained.\u00a0\u00a0However, the Review did also\u00a0acknowledged the challenges that PPPs can pose in terms of\u00a0scale\u00a0and complexity of\u00a0the PPP contract.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  While recommending that PPPs continue to be considered as a procurement option for suitable projects, the report also recommended that in order to address the scale\/complexity issue,\u00a0the scope for creating a new PPP-type procurement option that would be suitable for\u00a0procuring smaller scale and less complex projects, over a shorter timeframe, be explored as an alternative\u00a0to the typical PPP procurement option, for\u00a0such smaller scale projects.\u00a0\u00a0 I am pleased to say that work is progressing\u00a0well on exploring this option and the European PPP Expertise Centre is assisting my Department in the matter.\u00a0 If\u00a0successful, this would certainly assist in addressing some of\u00a0the concerns of the Deputy in relation to\u00a0typical PPP procurements.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  I should, of course,\u00a0also point out that while a number of\u00a0projects have been,\u00a0and continue to be,\u00a0procured by PPP, the vast majority of public works contracts are procured as traditional Exchequer funded projects.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  However, even in relation to the large scale PPP projects, opportunities exist for the SME sector to\u00a0play a part in these projects.\u00a0\u00a0The NDFA, as part of the PPP procurement process, incorporates a programme-wide initiative with Enterprise Ireland whereby they host a series of &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo;

The NDP sets out a 10 year vision for Ireland&rsquo;s public capital infrastructure priorities over the next 10 years strictly aligned with the National Strategic Outcomes for Ireland&rsquo;s new spatial strategy contained in the NPF.  The NDP demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to meeting Ireland&rsquo;s infrastructure and investment needs over the next ten years, through a total investment estimated at &euro;116 billion.  This level of capital spending will ensure ongoing employment maintenance and creation with appropriate regional development. <\/p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 seeks to achieve ten strategic outcomes, building around the themes of wellbeing, equality and opportunity.  These ten shared priorities will ensure a consistent approach between planning objectives under the NPF and investment commitments under the NDP.<\/p>  <p>  Turning to budgetary reform to support delivery of equality objectives, following a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to &lsquo;develop the process of budget and policy proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights&rsquo; an Equality Budgeting pilot was implemented for the 2018 budgetary cycle.  The approach\u00a0I have taken\u00a0in introducing Equality Budgeting in Ireland is that\u00a0equality budgeting\u00a0is to\u00a0be integrated into the existing budgetary process.  Therefore, equality budgeting is\u00a0contained within the existing performance budgeting framework and utilises the\u00a0processes already in place. <\/p>  <p>  The measures identified in the pilot related mainly to gender equality but as I outlined in my budget statement in October equality budgeting remains a priority for the coming year and I am therefore expanding the programme to further develop the gender budgeting elements, and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality.

The framework allows evaluators to broaden the scope of the current SIA practice to take account of not only tax and social welfare measures, but also assess how changes in public expenditure policy can impact on household outcomes and living standards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700071#WRH02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1292"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Issues","counter":410,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700071#WRH02600"},{"type":"question","counter":411,"qnumday":200,"qnumall":"[49486\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700071#WRH02700","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the extent to which he and his Department have identified issues likely to cause inflation in the property market thereby excluding domestic purchasers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The membership of the group includes nominees of the Department, HEIs providing primary and post primary initial teacher education, the Teaching Council, the HEA, primary and post primary school management bodies, as well as an independent expert.  Addressing the issue of teacher supply is complex and involves consideration of a wide range of issues including: initial teacher education policy, provision, funding and support; data\/research requirements; policies and arrangements for schools and teachers that impact on teacher mobility\/supply and promotion of the teaching profession.  Arising from the work of the steering group an Action Plan for Teacher Supply was published earlier this month with actions identified under four policy headings:  Data\/Research; Higher Education; Promotion of the teaching profession; Policies and arrangements impacting on teacher supply.  The Steering Group will oversee the implementation of the Action Plan which aims to address the current challenges in Teacher Supply and ensure adequate supply of appropriately qualified teachers into the future.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to concessions for students in the school referred to, that are due to sit the leaving certificate examination in 2019, some flexibility may be possible around the completion dates for practical coursework.

No further concessions can be granted in relation to marking of candidates&rsquo; examination work as ultimately all candidates must be subject to the same marking procedures and standards.  This is consistent with one of the underlying principles of the operation of the State Examinations in that the SEC must apply marking schemes uniformly to all candidates in the interests of inter-candidate equity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700072#WRJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1290"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":480,"content":"<p>Question No. 227 answered with Question No. 220.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Employment Initiative","counter":482,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700073#WRK00200"},{"type":"question","counter":483,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[48876\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700073#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the annual amount allocated to Ireland under the youth employment initiative in each year since it commenced; the amount that was expended in each year subsequently and to date in 2018; the projects that have been allocated funding in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1290"},{"type":"question","counter":484,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[48877\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700073#WRK00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to set out the annual amount allocated to Ireland under the European Social Fund education and training ErasmusPro and the Youth Employment Initiative budgets for 2014 to 2018 by employment and training, apprenticeships of young persons; and the amount that was expended in each of the areas in each of the years 2014 to 2017 and to date in 2018.","asker":"1229","askee":"1290"},{"type":"speech","counter":485,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 228 and 229 together.<\/p><p>The Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) is integrated into European Social Fund (ESF) programming as a dedicated priority axis within the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020 (PEIL).

Improvements in the rate of youth unemployment coupled with the discontinuance of the JobBridge and Momentum schemes had consequences for the expenditure expected on YEI activities.  Consequently, the Programme Monitoring Committee agreed to the inclusion of the Community Training Centres; the Defence Forces Employment Support Scheme (DFESS) and the Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) under the YEI.  At the same time, the Committee agreed to the removal of the T&uacute;s, JobBridge and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme from the YEI, having unsuccessfully explored the potential to use Simplified Cost Option models and\/or in the light of audit trail difficulties.

In accordance with these Criteria and Guidelines, inclusive education is a mandatory component for all students in ITE. Inclusive education encompasses education of children with special educational needs, including autism.<\/p><p>The learning outcomes of ITE programmes also reflect the need for the teacher to be able to conduct a systematic, holistic assessment of learner needs; to apply knowledge of the individual potential of students, their disposition towards learning and their backgrounds, identities and learning styles to their teaching; to set clear, challenging and achievable expectations for pupils; to evaluate learner progress; to act as an advocate for students, referring students for educational support as required and participating in the provision of that support, amongst other relevant outcomes.<\/p><p>The Teaching Council is currently carrying out a review of the impact of the current programmes, with a view to amending the Criteria and Guidelines before the next round of accreditation commences in 2020.<\/p><p>A recently published report from the National Council for Special Education on <i>Initial Teacher Education for Inclusion: Phase 1 and 2<\/i>(NCSE Research Report No. 26), found that there is in general much good practice related to inclusive education in ITE, particularly in relation to the fostering of positive attitudes to inclusion, while also noting scope for further alignment between theory and practice, in particular as between student placement and the university experience.

Neither type of CCTV system may be established without authorisation by the Garda Commissioner under section 38 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, among other requirements.<\/p><p>Community CCTV is governed by section 38(3)(c) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006 (SI No 289 of 2006). Under the 2005 Act as amended, the power to establish the criteria for community CCTV schemes is a matter for the Policing Authority, by order made with the approval of the Government.<\/p><p>This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must-<\/p><p>- be approved by the local Joint Policing Committee,<\/p><p>- have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner, and<\/p><p>- have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller.<\/p><p>This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of whether or not grant funding is sought from my Department to assist in their establishment. <\/p><p>In accordance with this legal framework, I understand that the large majority of local authorities have previously undertaken to act as data controllers in the context of specific community CCTV schemes. This has been the case either in the course of the current grant-aid scheme administered by my Department, in connection with the previous grant-aid scheme operated by Pobal on behalf of the Department, or in connection with schemes funded independently by local authorities. I understand from my Department's engagement with the Local Government Management Agency that the total number of local authorities which have undertaken the role of data controller for these purposes amounts to 28 out of the 31 local authorities nationwide.<\/p><p>Nonetheless, my Department is engaging on an ongoing basis with the Local Government Management Agency and the County and City Management Association, to clarify any queries arising and to assist in resolving any concerns.<\/p><p>The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s Office has confirmed as recently as May of this year that it does not have any concerns in relation to the legislative basis for CCTV. However it is currently conducting an audit of the practice, operation and governance of CCTV. We expect findings from this process to be of assistance to all concerned and in particular to local authorities.<\/p><p>Finally, I would recall that the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems. In pursuance of this commitment, a grant-aid scheme to assist groups in the establishment of community-based CCTV systems in their local areas is being administered by my Department. Community groups and local authorities can apply for grant-aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.<\/p><p>There have to date been 27 applications to the scheme. 20 applications have been approved, with grant aid totalling more than &euro;500,000 approved from the total &euro;1 million available for 2018.

The Act also introduced a new power of arrest without warrant, where a Garda suspects that a person has breached or is about to breach a bail condition and the Garda considers it necessary to arrest the person immediately to prevent harm to, interference with or intimidation of the victim or a witness to the offence alleged.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700077#WRO00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Crime Data","counter":687,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700077#WRO01000"},{"type":"question","counter":688,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[49098\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700077#WRO01100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the annual number of crimes in which a knife was used and-or was an element of the crime in each of the years 2011 to 2017 and to date in 2018, in tabular form; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1296","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":689,"content":"<p>As the Deputy\u00a0will be\u00a0aware, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), as\u00a0the national statistical agency, is responsible for the compilation and publication of\u00a0all crime statistics.<\/p>  <p>  However, it is my understanding that the information being sought by the Deputy in relation to this particular crime category is not available through the CSO at this time.\u00a0 To be of assistance,\u00a0I have requested that the CSO\u00a0forward the\u00a0relevant statistics to\u00a0the Deputy\u00a0as soon as\u00a0they become\u00a0available.<\/p>  <p>  While the most recent publication of the official recorded crime statistics remain 'Under Reservation' due to issues around PULSE data,\u00a0it is important to note the CSO, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, continues to make progress on returning the crime figures to the higher standard expected of our national crime statistics.

Relevant legislation in this area includes section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, section 8 of the Family Law Act 1995, section 13 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and section 45 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 provides for a number of improvements in the law relating to maintenance of children.<\/p>  <p>  It is open to parents who have separated\/divorced to decide between themselves on maintenance arrangements for their children.  If they cannot agree, they can try to work out a maintenance agreement through mediation.  However, if parents still cannot agree on maintenance arrangements, an application must be made to the courts for a maintenance order.  If a parent\/spouse\/civil partner fails to comply with a court order or falls behind with payments where there is a maintenance order in place, an attachment of earnings order can be sought from the court, if the person is in employment or on a private pension. This order results in the maintenance amount being deducted at source by the employer of the parent\/spouse\/civil partner. A person can apply for an Attachment of Earnings Order when first applying for a maintenance order through the court, if they are concerned that maintenance will not be paid, or they can apply later if the maintenance is not paid. An enforcement summons can be applied for if the parent\/spouse\/civil partner is self-employed. <\/p>  <p>  Under section 9A of the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, the District Court has the power to regard a failure by a parent\/spouse\/civil partner to comply with a court order as contempt of court and to deal with it accordingly, including by means of imprisonment.  The maintenance creditor may apply to the District Court Clerk for a summons directing the maintenance debtor to appear before the District Court. The court will then hear evidence from the maintenance creditor and maintenance debtor including evidence about the financial circumstances of the maintenance debtor and, where relevant, the maintenance creditor.<\/p>  <p>  The other issues raised in the correspondence are not within my remit as Minister for Justice and Equality.

The Garda authorities advise that the number of Garda vehicles fitted with ANPR equipment varies on a daily basis, due to operational requirements, including repair and maintenance of equipment and &lsquo;end-of-life&rsquo; of vehicles and equipment, the up-dating of software and the decommissioning of damaged units.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as of 1 November 2018, there are 289 vehicles attached to Roads Policing Units nationwide. 76 of these currently have ANPR capacity, which amounts to just over 26% of the vehicles allocated to Roads Policing Units.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the capacity and capabilities of ANPR, including the expansion of the deployment of such systems within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are kept under regular review by senior Garda management. <\/p>  <p>  More generally, I can confirm that the Garda Mobility Strategy, which aims to provide frontline members with greater connectivity to back-office systems harnessing the power of mobile technology, forms part of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.

Consequently, and consistent with its strategic focus on deploying finite specialist resources (i.e., Garda, accounting, legal and digital forensics) towards more serious indications of wrongdoing, the ODCE did not initiate any summary prosecutions in the District Court over the period 2017 to 2018.<\/p><p>Referrals to the DPP<\/p><p>Investigations into more serious indications of wrongdoing will typically result in a file being submitted to the DPP for consideration as to whether charges should be directed on indictment.

The recruitment and assimilation of a large number of new professional staff into a multi-disciplinary organisation that undertakes complex work in a fast-moving environment is a project that requires careful management. As such, the Director is of the view that it is preferable to allow that process to fully bed down before filling the aforementioned vacancy. The Director is further conscious of the fact that the transition of the ODCE to a stand-alone Agency will give rise to additional expertise requirements and, as such, is of the view that it is prudent that those considerations should be factored into developing the role, and associated skill set, required of the appointee.<\/p>  <p>  As part of the annual budgetary process, the ODCE has sought additional funding in respect of 2019.

My Department works closely with its agencies to fund climate change related research and to deliver environmental performance improvement programmes which directly assist enterprise in reducing emissions and improving energy efficiency.<\/p>  <p>  Climate change adaptation and mitigation measures are a central part of our policy considerations and are a key factor when developing new initiatives. For example, the Future Jobs initiative is the Government's new plan and programme of action for the next phase of Ireland's economic development. The initiative is being developed jointly by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach and we expect to launch the initiative early next year. One of the key areas being considered under the initiative is adaptation to the &lsquo;Low Carbon Economy&rsquo; and how enterprises can innovate and adapt to succeed in a low carbon economy. The initiative recognises that climate change impacts how we do business and requires a change to production and consumption methods.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is administering the Government&rsquo;s new &euro;500m Disruptive Technologies Innovation Fund, one of four funds in the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  Applications under the fund must align with research priority areas which include climate action related areas such as &ldquo;Decarbonising the Energy System&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sustainable Living&rdquo;.  Applications under the first funding call are currently being considered. <\/p>  <p>  Innovation 2020, Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for research and development, science and technology, contains a series of actions to promote research and innovation in climate change related areas.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the initiatives being developed and implemented by my Department, the enterprise sector continues to participate in emission reduction efforts with accompanying obligations to reduce emissions.  Irish enterprises' main contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions is through the European Union Emissions Trading System which includes approximately one hundred installations of Ireland&rsquo;s largest energy users, who account for more than 25% of Ireland&rsquo;s emissions.  The Emissions Trading System operates on a &ldquo;cap and trade&rdquo; basis, with the cap continuously reducing over time.  Under Phase IV of the System which will commence in 2021, the sectors covered by EU ETS must reduce their emissions by 43% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.<\/p>  <p>  Two hundred of Ireland&rsquo;s largest energy users are members of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s Large Industry Energy Network. Estimated energy savings of over 10% were achieved by network members in 2017 and over 300 projects were implemented covering a wide range of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.<\/p>  <p>  A number of companies are availing of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland initiatives such as the &ldquo;Lighting Support Scheme for SMEs&rdquo; and the Excellence in Energy Efficient Design, which incorporate energy efficiency into design projects.  Enterprises continue to avail of the Accelerated Capital Allowances scheme for Energy Efficient Equipment to assist them in their purchase of highly energy efficient equipment.<\/p>  <p>  In terms of my Department&rsquo;s agency initiatives in the area of climate change, Science Foundation Ireland funds climate action related research in areas such climate change mitigation and renewable energy. <\/p>  <p>  IDA&rsquo;s Environmental Aid Programme assists client companies to implement major renewable energy or energy efficiency initiatives or address other environmental issues such as waste reduction.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland supports companies to improve their environmental performance, drive environmental efficiencies and achieve improved sustainability.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1249"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":807,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02600"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medical Card Applications","counter":806,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02500"},{"type":"question","counter":807,"qnumday":344,"qnumall":"[48843\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a medical card will issue to persons (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":808,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, the Deputy's question has been forwarded to the HSE for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"HSE Properties","counter":809,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02800"},{"type":"question","counter":810,"qnumday":345,"qnumall":"[48851\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the details of HSE properties (details supplied).","asker":"1278","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":811,"content":"<p>As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the management of the health care property estate, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to you in relation to this matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Waiting Lists","counter":812,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ03100"},{"type":"question","counter":813,"qnumday":346,"qnumall":"[48859\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700079#WRQ03200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 365 of 23 October 2018, if a date has been set for scoliosis surgery for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1341","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":814,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

CervicalCheck laboratory activity has since been significantly above normal levels. This is as a result both of these out of cycle smears and increased uptake generally, and has impacted turnaround times for results of smear tests. This is a priority concern for my Department. <\/p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that, currently, receipt of results of smear tests may take up to 20 weeks, that it may take longer in a small number of cases, and that it is working closely with laboratories to address this issue. <\/p>  <p>  Smear test samples must be sent to the laboratory and made into slides within six weeks of the smear test date. After six weeks, the sample is deemed expired and cannot be processed. In some cases, the increased volume has resulted in a delay transferring samples to slides. The HSE has advised that, since 30 July 2018, the majority of smear test samples are now transferred to slides within the six-week timeframe. The HSE has further advised that, in October 2017, there was a 0.25% rate of expired samples and vials. For the same period in 2018 the rate was 0.29%. Additionally, in some cases a sample may be insufficient. <\/p>  <p>  Although every effort is made to avoid these situations from happening, it is inevitable that cervical screening programmes will sometimes encounter these issues. In such cases, a woman and her GP are advised of the need for a repeat test in three months&rsquo; time by letter from CervicalCheck. <\/p>  <p>  In regard to the specific details sought in relation to numbers of slides, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700080#WRR04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Medicinal Products Reimbursement","counter":882,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700080#WRR05000"},{"type":"question","counter":883,"qnumday":371,"qnumall":"[48981\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700080#WRR05100","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if the cost of prescribed medicinal cannabis for a person (details supplied) with multiple sclerosis will be reimbursed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1324","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":884,"content":"<p>The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.<\/p><p>Sativex is not currently reimbursed in the community drug schemes.

It is providing oversight to the implementation of the recommendations of the national Obesity Policy &amp;amp; Action Plan (OPAP).  At its next meeting, the OPIOG will consider the Report on Tackling Childhood Obesity from the Joint Oireachtas  Committee on Children and Youth Affairs for the purposes of, among others, aligning both sets of recommendations.  In the meantime, the preparation of a Progress Report on the implementation of OPAP is continuing so that it can be considered at this next OPIOG meeting.<\/p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the OPIOG agreed to establish a sub-group for Reformulation earlier this year.  This sub-group has met on a number of occasions since being established and agreed their Terms of Reference.  The Reformulation sub-group is technical in its work programme.  The work of the sub-group will primarily set targets on reformulation of food and drink. It will also make recommendations on addressing reduction of portion sizes and on monitoring and validation procedures.  As part of its work, a workshop between the Reformulation sub-group and Food Sector Stakeholders on reformulation took place on 20 September last.  This workshop provided an important opportunity for detailed engagement with key Food Sector Stakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of reformulation in the interests of promoting the health and well-being of the population.  And the work of the sub-group will now build on this engagement.<\/p>  <p>  The report of the sub-group, which is anticipated to be finalised in the first half of next year, will among other things, explore approaches and make recommendations to address reducing portion sizes along with considering options for implementing recommendations in particular, monitoring and validation procedures.<\/p>  <p>  While there are no plans at this juncture to establish any additional sub-groups along the lines referred to by the Deputy, the Chair of the OPIOG keeps such questions under review.<\/p>  <p>  The commencement of the Sugar-Sweetened Drinks Tax on 1 May last was in line with one of the recommendations in the OPAP.  It represents a positive step in our national policy to deal with the problem of obesity.  Work on the development of an evaluation framework for this tax is well underway and I anticipate that this framework will be well advanced by early next year.  In addition, Codes of Practice for food and beverages promotion, marketing and sponsorship were developed involving representatives from the food industry, advertising sector, statutory agencies, and various Government Departments.  It was chaired by the former CEO of the statutory Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  The Codes of Practice concerned were published in February.  Earmarking a process for monitoring the Codes and the development of a related process to agree guidance for supporting them are continuing.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, a number of Government policies aim to support the design and development of built environments that enhance health, wellbeing and quality of life for all.  The National Physical Activity Plan (NPAP) and OPAP both require that joint action is taken to promote the importance of physical activity and to reduce the obesogenic nature of the built environment. <\/p>  <p>  In line with Actions 31 of the NPAP and 2.1 of the OPAP, which commit to developing guidelines and support materials for those working in developing the built environment in order to promote the importance of physical activity, and Action 59 of the NPAP which commits to developing a programme of on-going stakeholder communication and engagement, a Stakeholder Forum was held on the 21 November last. <\/p>  <p>  The event was planned in partnership, with substantial input from three Government Departments, (Health; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Housing, Planning and Local Government) and was hosted in the National Indoor Arena, Sport Ireland National Sports Campus, Abbottstown.  I am pleased to note that the event was well attended with 125 delegates.<\/p>  <p>  This Forum, entitled Connect, Collaborate, Create; Co-Designing Healthier Communities, A Healthy Ireland Stakeholder Forum on the Built Environment, brought together those who have a responsibility for planning and developing public spaces with those who have expertise regarding the impacts of the built environment on health and wellbeing, sport and physical activity.<\/p>  <p>  I was delighted to address this Forum together with my colleague Simon Harris T.D., Minister for Health, and the CEO of Sport Ireland, John Treacy.  Sessions were chaired by officials from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Health. Expert presentations were given regarding optimal design of healthier communities, the Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) and the new Town and Village Toolkit, which is about to be launched by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland (RIAI).<\/p>  <p>  Presentations were also given by Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council on the lessons learned from the success of the Waterford Greenway, and on the development of the No Fry Zone initiative in Greystones, Co.

However, the Authority does take into account all information it receives, including complaints from the public, when carrying out inspections.   <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Ombudsman, as an independent body, can examine complaints about the actions of a range of public bodies and, from 24 August 2015, complaints relating to the administrative actions of private nursing homes.

A range of recommendations for action by the HSE in collaboration with other stakeholders is identified, to provide assurance that the use of mesh implants and the care of women requiring aftercare in Irish hospitals is in line with emerging evidence and best practice internationally, based on expert advice received and review of international experience. <\/p><p><b>Methodology<\/b><\/p><p>Preparation of the report has involved consultation and engagement with national and international bodies, including the Health Products Regulatory Agency (HPRA); the relevant professional training bodies, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecology (IOG) and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI); the Continence Foundation of Ireland (CFI) and the Health Service Executive (HSE), as well as colleagues in other jurisdictions.  The report has been informed by review of international reports and safety reviews of mesh surgery which have been published in recent years. The report has also been informed by the personal experiences of women who have suffered complications following mesh surgery.<\/p><p>I wish to acknowledge the bravery, commitment and dignity shown, by the women that met with me and by those women who have written to me concerning this issue, in sharing what were harrowing, deeply personal experiences. <\/p><p>It is important to note that the views of the many women who have undergone mesh procedures and have had satisfactory outcomes, with minor or no complications, have not been formally sought and so are not reflected in this report. Also, following the implementation of a pause in mesh procedures by the HSE in July 2018, as described in Section 2, a number of women whose procedures were postponed made representations to the Department expressing concern at the impact that this has on them personally as they await treatment for the distressing symptoms of SUI, reflecting another important group of women affected directly by this issue.<\/p><p><b>Report Findings<\/b><\/p><p>The report makes a number of overall findings, in addition findings are presented which relate to informed consent, aftercare of women with complications, clinical and professional issues and information issues. The findings are:<\/p><p>Overall Findings<\/p><p>- Mesh implant devices are certified as compliant with relevant European Union (EU) legislation and no market action against mesh devices for the treatment of SUI or POP has been taken by any of the European device regulatory competent authorities.  <\/p><p>- There is an extensive evidence base supporting (i) the use of the mid-urethral sling (MUS) devices in the treatment of SUI and (ii) the use of abdominally placed mesh in the management of POP. A significant majority of patients benefit greatly from these procedures, with reduced long-term complications and improved functional outcomes compared to non-mesh procedures. <\/p><p>- Mesh procedures should be performed by trained personnel, in patients who are appropriately selected and counselled and when appropriate multidisciplinary expertise and clinical governance mechanisms are in place.<\/p><p>- Transvaginal placement of mesh for the treatment of POP is no longer regarded as appropriate first line treatment. Its use is restricted by clinical guidance in some jurisdictions. Regulatory restrictions on its use are in place in Australia and New Zealand.<\/p><p>- Mesh devices are associated with significant and severe complications in a minority of women, which are of concern given the difficulties of mesh implant removal.<\/p><p>- Many other health systems, including the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and the Netherlands have implemented specific measures in recent years to ensure appropriate use of mesh procedures in the treatment of SUI and POP and to ensure appropriate aftercare for women suffering mesh complications.<\/p><p>Informed Consent <\/p><p>- As would be usual with many surgical conditions, standardised information resources were not available at national level to ensure that all patients receive consistent information about the benefits and risks of mesh devices, to advise of other treatment options and to support informed consent processes.<\/p><p>- Many women reported that they were not informed of other treatment options; they had not been informed that their surgeries involved the use of mesh; they were not informed of mesh complications; and they were not made aware of the difficulties associated with mesh removal or with the treatment of long-term mesh complications. <\/p><p>Aftercare of Women with Complications<\/p><p>- Structured treatment or referral pathways were not evidently in place for the minority of women requiring specialist, multidisciplinary care for serious complications following mesh surgery. <\/p><p>- Some women reported considerable difficulty in accessing timely, compassionate and appropriate specialist aftercare for complications. <\/p><p>- Some women reported that individual clinicians responded to their personal concerns in an inappropriate manner which greatly added to their distress. Women also reported feeling that they were not believed, or that their clinicians minimised or did not understand the severity of their complications.  <\/p><p><b>Clinical and Professional Issues <\/b><\/p><p>- Governance mechanisms are not in place at national level to provide assurance that mesh surgeries are carried out in accordance with agreed international best practice and clinical guidance.<\/p><p>- There is no mandated professional clinical guidance at national level to guide the use of mesh implants in the management of SUI or POP or to guide the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>- Communication mechanisms currently in place at national level between the HPRA, healthcare providers and professional bodies do not provide assurance that the findings and recommendations of safety reviews such as those circulated by the HPRA in recent years regarding mesh implants are systematically analysed and acted upon where appropriate.<\/p><p>Information<\/p><p>- There are significant gaps in knowledge about current practice in Ireland regarding the use of urogynaecological mesh implants. <\/p><p>- Routinely collected clinical information at national level does not provide the capacity for monitoring or audit of mesh surgeries for the treatment of SUI and POP.<\/p><p>- Based on international experience, there is under-reporting of adverse events relating to mesh surgeries by clinicians to both the HPRA and to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) operated by the State Claims Agency (SCA). <\/p><p><b>Recommendations<\/b><\/p><p>Nineteen recommendations in total are identified throughout the report in response to the findings above:<\/p><p>- Patient Information and Consent - 2 recommendations;<\/p><p>- Aftercare for Women Suffering Complications - 5 recommendations;<\/p><p>- Clinical and Professional Recommendations - 8 recommendations;<\/p><p>- Information Recommendations - 5 recommendations.<\/p><p>These include recommendations about the development of patient information and informed consent materials to ensure appropriate patient selection and counselling, ensuring clinical and professional standards of practice are met by ensuring that all surgeons have undergone appropriate surgical professional training and ensuring that appropriate multidisciplinary expertise is available in units carrying out mesh procedures, the development of clinical guidance for the management of SUI and POP, the development of information resources to monitor the ongoing use of mesh devices and to permit long-term research and audit of practice, ensuring the reporting of mesh related complications, and ensuring timely, appropriate and accessible care pathways for the management of women with complications. <\/p><p>Full implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations will provide significant assurance that all patients presenting for treatment for SUI and POP and all women who develop mesh-related complications receive high quality, patient centred care in accordance with accepted evidence and supported by robust clinical governance mechanisms. <\/p><p><b>Actions to date<\/b><\/p><p>A number of important interim system actions to address the safety and effectiveness of mesh implant use have been progressed in advance of completion of the report.<\/p><p><i>1.  Pause on all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures<\/i><\/p><p>On 24 July 2018, the HSE was requested by the CMO to pause all uro-gynaecological mesh procedures, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations relating to (i) professional training requirements, (ii) patient information and consent and (iii) the development and maintenance of a national data set for all mesh procedures carried out in HSE funded hospitals. The request to institute a pause in vaginal mesh procedures was considered proportionate and necessary to address public and patient concern about the ongoing safety of mesh devices as comprehensively as possible. <\/p><p><i>2.  Development of patient information and consent materials<\/i><\/p><p>Prior to this request, in May 2018, the HSE had been requested to begin work immediately on the development of national standardised patient information and informed consent materials and the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering serious complications. <\/p><p><i>3.  Learning Notice on mesh devices <\/i><\/p><p>A Learning Notice concerning mesh devices in uro-gynaecological procedures was circulated by the National Women and Infants&rsquo; Health Programme (NWIHP) on 26 June 2018 to all maternity hospitals and acute hospitals with gynaecological services to highlight the importance of appropriate patient selection, adequate information and consent and also to inform the service providers that a Response Group has been convened to propose remedies for and address the provision of aftercare for complications. This learning notice has been posted on the NWIHP website. <\/p><p><i>3.  Synthetic Mesh Devices Group<\/i><\/p><p>A Synthetic Mesh Devices Advisory Group has been convened by the NWIHP which includes three patient representatives, as well as representatives of the HPRA, the IOG, the RCSI, the CFI and all Hospital Groups, to advise on and progress all the interim recommendations as advised to the HSE in May 2018 and in July 2018.  To ensure that the spectrum of views of women affected by mesh safety concerns is represented, the three patient representatives include Ms Melanie Power, representative of Mesh Survivors Ireland; as well as a woman who has had a successful outcome of mesh surgery for the treatment of SUI and a woman who is on the waiting list for surgery (currently paused).<\/p><p>I am informed that a work programme for the development of appropriate patient information resources and consent materials, the clarification and development of treatment pathways and appropriate referral services for women suffering from mesh-related complications including access to specialist diagnostic facilities such as translabial scanning is being progressed through this Group. The work being progressed by the HSE will include identifying the appropriate specialist clinical expertise and facilities required at hospital group level and nationally to provide comprehensive aftercare services. Pending the completion of this, the HSE will also examine the need to look at sourcing services from abroad to address any immediate shortfalls identified, either through utilisation of the treatment abroad scheme or by commissioning services from abroad. <\/p><p><b>Next Steps<\/b><\/p><p>As requested by the CMO in July 2018, the pause in the use of mesh procedures for the management of SUI and POP in HSE-funded hospitals is ongoing, in cases where it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, pending confirmation by the HSE of the implementation of recommendations.  <\/p><p>The Department will be writing to the HSE to request that it prepare a detailed Implementation Plan for the complete set of recommendations set out in the CMO&rsquo;s Report, working in conjunction with other stakeholders. <\/p><p>As promised at my meeting with Mesh Survivors Ireland on 14 June 2018, I provided the group with a copy of the CMO&rsquo;s Report on the date of publication and a date has been arranged for a further meeting with the group in coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700084#WRV01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1058,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700084#WRV01100"},{"type":"question","counter":1059,"qnumday":429,"qnumall":"[49302\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700084#WRV01200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will receive a hospital appointment.","asker":"1217","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1060,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

Our climate change targets are national and not sectoral in nature. For this reason a National Mitigation Plan was published in 2017 which begins to set Ireland on a pathway towards decarbonisation. The Plan contains over 100 actions, with defined timelines, that will help reduce emissions from across the whole of Government with specific emphasis on the electricity generation, built environment, agricultural and transport sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The transport sector has a vital role to play in the national mitigation effort, particularly in addressing national non-traded emissions targets. I am acutely aware of the specific challenges we face in transport where travel demand is growing and fossil fuel use is firmly established. To address this challenge, we are strongly pursuing emission reductions and energy efficiencies in transport across four key strands. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, we are increasing investment in public and sustainable transport to support mode shift and accommodate growing travel demand.  An efficient public transport sector is a key priority in meeting our climate change goals.  The National Development Plan has committed &euro;8.6 billion to public transport over the next 10 years to 2027.  Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to providing an alternative to the private car, not only to reduce congestion and emissions but also to enable the transport sector to cater, in an environmentally sustainable way, for the increasing demands associated with growing population and employment.  Major projects planned include: BusConnects, which will transform the bus network in our cities with new and expanded bus routes, greatly improved bus access, designated segregated cycle lanes and park and ride facilities; investment in the DART Expansion Programme; and the MetroLink.  We also have multi-annual urban Cycling and Walking Infrastructure investment underway for our main cities. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, we are encouraging a transition away from fossil fuels.  In the 'National Policy Framework on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure for Transport in Ireland' I firmly outlined my ambition that by 2030 all new cars and vans sold in Ireland would be zero-emission capable. To support this ambition and a Programme for Partnership Government commitment, an interdepartmental Low-Emitting Vehicles (LEV) Taskforce was jointly convened by my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Phase 1 of the Taskforce considered a range of measures and options to accelerate the deployment of EVs.  Arising from their recommendations further investment and incentives for EVs were announced as part of Budgets 2018 and 2019 aimed at assisting all drivers in purchasing hybrid or electric cars, including significant toll reductions.  Phase 1 of the LEV Taskforce is now complete and the LEV Taskforce Progress Report is available on my Department's website.  Phase 2 has begun its work and will consider the options available to Government to support the deployment of other alternative fuels, including natural gas, biomethane, and hydrogen, with a particular emphasis on the heavy duty vehicle sector.<\/p>  <p>  Thirdly, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme plays a major role in decarbonising the road transport sector in Ireland.  The penetration of biofuels as a share of road transport energy has increased significantly over recent years from a share of 4% in 2010 to 8% (by volume) from 2017.  It is intended that the biofuel obligation scheme will be incrementally increased on a sustainable basis to help meet the renewable transport target of 10% by 2020 as set under the Renewable Energy Directive. The obligation rate will increase to 10% by volume from 1 January 2019; and a further increase to 11% is likely from 1 January 2020.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, an important role will be played by more efficient standards for vehicles.  Ireland continues to push strongly for better EU vehicles standards, seeking greater ambition in regulations that ensure vehicles registered in Europe are increasingly more efficient and less emitting.  It is through better technology and improved efficiency that vehicle emissions can be decoupled from increased economic activity and population growth.<\/p>  <p>  It is imperative that we continue to broaden our range of mitigation measures. To this end, in 2018, I launched a reduced EV tolling regime as well as a grant aimed at encouraging taxis and hackneys towards electrification. I was delighted to see the positive EV sales this year with over 6500 EVs now on Irish roads - nearly 40 of which are taxis\/hackneys providing the opportunity for a wide range or passengers to experience an EV.  My Department is also undertaking trials on alternatively fuelled buses to further inform future bus purchasing decisions. <\/p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with other Departments and Agencies to research and develop new sectoral and cross-sectoral measures on a whole of Government and least-cost basis to advance Ireland's decarbonisation policy pathway.  The Department actively participates in the cross-Government climate structures and TRAM group, and three specific research projects to examine the role of behavioural change and the pathway to zero-emissions in the heavy duty vehicle sector are being co-funded by my Department to develop proactive, new and innovative tools to help reduce transport emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","counter":1327,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02700"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child and Family Agency Staff","counter":1326,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1327,"qnumday":525,"qnumall":"[48853\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if the new Tusla facility being developed in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, will require new nursing staff; if so, the location in which persons can apply for these positions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1343","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1328,"content":"<p>This is an operational matter for Tusla and I have referred the Deputy's question to Tusla for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Youth Services Funding","counter":1329,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA02900"},{"type":"question","counter":1330,"qnumday":526,"qnumall":"[49004\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700089#WRAA03000","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"when an organisation (details supplied) will receive relevant funding to provide security for the service.","asker":"1231","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1331,"content":"<p>My Department has commenced a process to identify service development needs for 2019 and to finalise the 2019 youth funding allocations.

Receiving the\u00a0maximum rate of JA without a strong financial incentive to engage in education, training or employment can lead to long-term welfare dependency from a young age. As a result,\u00a0if a young jobseeker on a reduced JA payment participates on an education or training programme they receive\u00a0the maximum\u00a0weekly personal payment of &euro;198.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that in 2013 the EU adopted a Council Recommendation to member states on a Youth Guarantee. The aim of the EU-wide Youth Guarantee, supported by central EU funding of &euro;6 billion, was to provide young people under the age of 25 with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within a short time of becoming unemployed.\u00a0 Many of the elements of a Youth Guarantee were already in place in Ireland prior to the EU Recommendation, so the implementation of the Irish Youth Guarantee focuses on enhancing processes and policies for assisting young unemployed people to secure sustainable jobs. \u00a0Under the Youth Guarantee process case officers engage with unemployed young people, on a monthly basis, to prepare and implement personal progression plans for employment.\u00a0 Where young people do not find work quickly, additional supports are offered through places on employment and training schemes, which are closely aligned to the needs of the labour market. <\/p>  <p>  The Youth Employment Support Scheme (YESS) which I launched on 24 September 2018 is a new work experience scheme targeted exclusively at young jobseekers, aged 18 to 24, who are either long-term unemployed or face significant barriers to employment.\u00a0 All participants will receive a payment of &euro;229.20 per week from\u00a0my Department. Participants whose underlying entitlement is in excess of that amount will continue to receive their weekly payment with an additional top-up allowance of &euro;22.50 per week.<\/p>  <p>  These policies have been effective in reducing both youth and long-term unemployment. For example, the most recent data shows that Irish youth unemployment has fallen from a peak of 31.2% in 2012 to 12.0% in October 2018.\u00a0 Irish youth unemployment has thus fallen from well above the EU average in 2012 (23%) to well below the current EU figure of 14.9%. <\/p>  <p>  \u00a0The Department is also considering the contents of research undertaken by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, which examined the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and opportunities. The University examined the data for 18 and 19 year olds as the reduced rates were first introduced for this cohort. Their findings found positive results noting an overall reduction in unemployment durations.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0Age-related reduced rates do not apply to jobseekers with a qualified child, those transferring directly to JA from Disability Allowance or if their claim is linked to a previous JA claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied. Jobseekers aged 18-24 years who were in the care of the Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) during the period of 12 months before age 18 are not subject to age-related reduced rates\u00a0(this also includes\u00a0young unaccompanied minors who\u00a0were\u00a0in the care of TULSA).\u00a0The Department actively engages with Tusla and non-Government organisations to provide\u00a0supports to vulnerable young people leaving care on a case by case basis who are experiencing homelessness or are in insecure situations.<\/p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme,\u00a0the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.\u00a0\u00a0ENPs can be paid to assist with rent deposits and the costs of setting up home, including to young persons leaving direct provision accommodation and moving into the community. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  CWS staff have extensive engagement with a range of stakeholders and advocacy groups working with vulnerable people, and, for example, engages in local inter-agency responses to homelessness through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit in Dublin and engagement with Homeless Action Teams (HATs) throughout the country.\u00a0\u00a0The Department also meets with organisations specifically working with migrants including Crosscare through the Migrant Consultative Forum. This is\u00a0a forum where representatives of NGOs with a specialist interest in issues concerning migrants, meet with Department representatives to discuss problems\/issues facing migrants in their dealings with the Department. <\/p>  <p>  I trust that this information is of assistance and if the Deputy is aware of a particular case where a vulnerable young person requires the assistance of my Department, the details should be provided for review. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700091#WRCC05300","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Pensions Reform","counter":1461,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700091#WRCC05400"},{"type":"question","counter":1462,"qnumday":569,"qnumall":"[49088\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700091#WRCC05500","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding the State pension age; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1463,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.\u00a0 This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) which was available to people aged 65 who satisfied the qualifying conditions.\u00a0 This measure standardised the State pension age for all at 66 years.\u00a0 This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.<\/p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to State pension age.\u00a0 Where this is not possible,\u00a0they may\u00a0qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit.

It sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting vulnerable households from energy poverty through a combination of supports, investment in schemes to improve energy efficiency, and energy efficiency awareness initiatives.  One of the best ways to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling through proper building and household insulation.  The Warmer Homes Scheme, administered by Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, is designed to do that.  <\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD03500","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Partial Capacity Benefit Scheme","counter":1499,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD03600"},{"type":"question","counter":1500,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[49170\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD03700","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be investigated; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1328","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1501,"content":"<p>As requested a statement has been issued to the person concerned confirming the amount of money he receives weekly under the Partial Capacity Scheme.<\/p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD03800","answer":true,"speaker":"1338"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rural Social Scheme Data","counter":1502,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD03900"},{"type":"question","counter":1503,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[49317\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700092#WRDD04000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated full year cost if the 2019 budget for the rural social scheme increased by 12%; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1344","askee":"1338"},{"type":"speech","counter":1504,"content":"<p>The 2019 allocation for the rural social scheme is &euro;53.11 million.

As provided for under the Act, the register in respect of each local authority is available for inspection at its offices and online on its website.

The latter estimate for 2020 is based on the number of sites currently included on the local vacant site registers and in respect of which market valuations have been attached to the registered sites.

In overall terms, the key elements of the Government&rsquo;s approach to addressing the  issues in our housing sector are set out in the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness<\/i>, and <i>Project Ireland 2040,<\/i>which set out a comprehensive set of measures designed to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium.  <\/p><p>The generally accepted convention is that housing is deemed affordable where households, particularly low or moderate income households, are paying not much more than a third of their disposable income on meeting their accommodation needs.  In order to support households that have difficulty in accessing affordable housing, a multi-stranded, targeted approach is being pursued in the areas of the country most affected.  The measures are targeted at households earning a maximum of &euro;50,000 for a single applicant or &euro;75,000 for a couple.  <\/p><p>Under Budget 2019, the Government has trebled, to &euro;310 million, the funding available for key facilitating infrastructure on local authority sites, to support the provision of affordable homes to purchase or rent, under the Serviced Sites Fund (SSF).  <\/p><p>In terms of the type of affordable housing that will be delivered on local authority sites it may be affordable housing for purchase, for example, under the recently commenced provisions of Part 5 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, or cost rental, which is being advanced on a number of pilot sites before being rolled out further.  These initiatives complement other Government actions which help first-time buyers to buy a home, such as the Help to Buy Scheme and the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan.<\/p><p>The new Land Development Agency (LDA) will also contribute significantly to the delivery of affordable housing.  All of the State land developed by the LDA will include 40% social and affordable homes to purchase or rent.<\/p><p>While the State is playing its part in facilitating the additional supply of affordable housing, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) are another component part of a more sustainable, long-term property system.  While commercial property investment has been a key focus for some of the REITs launched to date in Ireland, residential property also forms part of the sector's activity.  It is expected that the sector will continue to develop over time and increase the supply of professionally managed, good quality, rented accommodation.  <\/p><p>Historically, the private rented sector in Ireland has been largely made up of small-scale landlords, who will continue to provide the bulk of private rented accommodation. However, a more diverse sector, which includes institutional investors specialised in providing and managing larger scale residential rental projects, provides more stability and less exposure to property market risk and volatility.  Institutional investors can also help provide the range of tenancy options that households need across their lifecycles.  Large-scale investment in property has an important role to play in helping to deliver the professional high-standard rental sector required.  The fact that institutional investors are entering the rental market, with a clear long-term focus on their investment provides security for tenants who can be confident that their landlord is committed for the long run. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700093#WREE04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1295"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Development Agency","counter":1564,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700093#WREE04900"},{"type":"question","counter":1565,"qnumday":604,"qnumall":"[48845\/18]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700093#WREE05000","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the way in which the Land Development Agency will interact with councils and local communities during the development process; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1242","askee":"1295"},{"type":"speech","counter":1566,"content":"<p>The recently established Land Development Agency (LDA) will act as a new commercial State body to actively manage the strategic development of public land, with particular focus on unlocking the potential of publicly owned brownfield sites.  <\/p>  <p>  The Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects and the provision of affordable housing.

A draft plan was prepared earlier this year by\u00a0the National Parks and Wildlife Service\u00a0in my Department and circulated to the Interdepartmental Biodiversity Working Group and the independent Biodiversity Forum for consultation and review, from May to the end of July 2018.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The draft sectoral plan was considered by a stakeholder workshop, held by my Department on the 16th October 2018.  There were 40 participants at the workshop, from across various sectors including representatives of\u00a0Regional Climate Change Offices and officials\u00a0from NPWS.  The workshop sought feedback and inputs on a number of important aspects relating to climate impacts and consequences for biodiversity and the biodiversity sector,\u00a0climate change adaptation actions and also\u00a0cross-sectoral linkages.  The\u00a0plan is now being redrafted\u00a0and the revised draft Biodiversity Sectoral Climate Change Adaptation Plan will go to public consultation\u00a0in Q1 2019.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Climate adaptation planning in the biodiversity sector is a cross cutting issue,\u00a0with responsibility for biodiversity protection, management and restoration spanning multiple government departments as well local authorities and non-State actors.  Nonetheless,\u00a0I am confident that the work being carried out by my Department, and colleagues across government, will help us\u00a0meet these challenges. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department is also involved in peatland restoration.  Irish peatlands are a huge carbon store, containing more than 75% of all the national soil organic carbon.  On average, peatlands are estimated to hold about 1,500 tons of soil carbon per hectare, i.e. about 10 times as much as a typical mineral soil.  Intact\u00a0 peatlands capture (sequester) carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation, but\u00a0the carbon is released back to the atmosphere if the peatland is damaged.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022 sets out how\u00a0raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and also how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within 3 cycles, with the first cycle operating for the duration of the current\u00a0Management Plan.  Work on this programme has already begun with a &euro;5.4m project &lsquo;The Living Bog&rsquo; which is co-funded by the EU LIFE 2014-2020 programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2018112700095#WRGG05200","answer":true,"speaker":"1243"}]
