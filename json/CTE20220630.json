We will, therefore, transact the business of the committee this morning and examine the Department's appropriation accounts at 1.30 p.m. with the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The public business before us this morning is as follows: minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business, AOB.  We will then briefly go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before suspending until 1.30 p.m.<\/p> <p>  The first item is the minutes for the meeting of 23 June which have been circulated to members.  Does any member wish to raise matters in relation to those minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.

The area I wanted to draw attention to is on page 6 of the reply.<\/p><p>That is to do with where people pay more than the due toll at the collection point.  The toll roads include the M1, M3, M6 and M7.  It is a relatively small amount but the companies can keep those relatively small amounts as revenue.  They say they put it back into road maintenance.<\/p><p> I inquired about this and received a reply from the Minister for Transport.  This relates to two toll facilities in particular - the Dublin tunnel and one other.  In 2019, a sizeable amount was overpaid.  That reduced in 2020, which I think was down to level of usage, but continued lower in 2021.  That was probably to do with contactless payment and people using tags.  The figure has been rounded up in some cases to &euro;2 rather than &euro;1.90 and it is a round figure.  That is probably the reason but it is still a sizeable amount that the toll operators get to keep.<\/p><p> They have said this goes back into maintenance but they are not due that money and the way it is treated is a concern for me.  It is just treated as their income.  We all know local shops routinely get a knock on the door to help with funding jerseys for a local football team but nobody thinks to knock on the door of the toll road companies when they get a sizeable amount that is not earned income.<\/p><p> The only comparison I can make is with Dublin Bus where it ceased giving people refunds because only approximately 10% of people ever went to get the refund where they made an overpayment.  Instead, the company put in place a programme of grants for the people in the catchment who would be customers of Dublin Bus.  That scheme of grants allows people or groups to make an application for aid.  It is a fair process, although it has not been much of a feature in the past couple of years for obvious reasons.  Each area benefits from that.  I have said it before that such a process would be more appropriate than the toll companies pocketing the money.  I have no confidence they are spending over and above what they say they are on maintenance.  It is not income they have earned but it comes directly from people's pockets when it should go back to something different.<\/p><p> That is the point I wanted to make.  All these companies will have received more than the due toll and some have received considerably more than the toll.  It would make a sizeable difference to people in communities.  We all know how difficult it is to keep community groups going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#A02700","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The figure for 2019 jumps out at &euro;44.9 million.

I have a concern in respect of how roads are being allocated funding and the criteria used.  I have raised the N2 road scheme from Clontibret to the Border, which is in my constituency but part of a much larger project that would increase connectivity to the north west, particularly counties Donegal and Derry.  It has been the subject of numerous Government policies and it is in the national development plan, as all these types of road projects are.  It has also been part of several peace process negotiations and included in Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 and other Government strategies.  Nevertheless, on a whim, the funding for the next phase has just been withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  We are told Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, makes these decisions based on some form of independent criteria but within this correspondence it confirms that consideration of allocation for future years is subject to review by the Department and any directions of the Minister.  There must be further review of the matter.  The main criteria under which the projects are assessed include safety, and the project in question has, quite rightly, been rated as highly positive in the impact it would have.  That is not surprising, considering that just last Friday there was another accident in the village of Emyvale, which this road would bypass.<\/p> <p>  On the criterion of economy the project has been rated as neutral.  This suggests the road is being taken on a stand-alone basis as opposed to the critical wider N2 and A5 connectivity link between the north west and Dublin.  All of this must be revisited.  It would be useful if we could ask in the first instance if TII's original proposal included allocation of the funds for 2022 for this road or if the proposal suggested this would be removed.  That would be useful.  In essence, we must find out who is stalling this road.<\/p> <p>  We know how it can be revisited because TII has told us that it happens via ministerial direction.  Government representatives could get their act together and fight for it, as they have done in other parts of the country.  What was the sequence of events that led to it being put on hold in the first place?

We would find it is way in excess of what the EU allows and, therefore, we are paying fines.  We could ask the question of what fines have been paid on foot of the Dublin Port tunnel toll barrier.  We are creating NOx emissions traps, and that is apart from anything related to the cost of living.<\/p><p>We cannot discount the fact that when a truck stops, the torque required for the truck to take off costs &euro;1.

All over the world, there are tolled tunnels that do not use an actual barrier.  We need to invest in that technology.

It provides useful objective information.  We have corresponded with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the matter.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  We raised this question with departmental officials when they appeared before the committee.  Many of the vehicles being purchased were very large ones, including Range Rover, BMW and Mercedes vehicles, with most of them being bought in the greater Dublin area.  One could draw the conclusion that they were not doing very long journeys whereas the people down the country who are travelling longer distances in diesel or petrol cars could not afford to purchase electric vehicles.  The explanation here is peculiar.  It confirms that financial support for electric vehicles is regressive and tends to benefit those at the higher end of the income distribution.  We should ask the Department why we continue with the grant system we have if it acknowledges that is the case.<\/p> <p>  Since the introduction of the EV grant, 27,546 vehicles have been supported at a cost of &euro;130 million, which is a substantial amount of money.  There is also &euro;166 million forgone in VRT.  Altogether, that is almost &euro;300 million and much of that is being spent supporting people to purchase very large vehicles.  Do people spending &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 on an enormous SUV really need the EV grant?  The committee should question departmental officials when they also acknowledge it is regressive.  Is it agreed that we correspond with the Department on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#D00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>A number of committees need to look at this issue.  From the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, there is a value-for-money issue here.  The international evidence is clear: without grant support, electric vehicles will not be purchased to a great degree.  When Denmark started to withdraw grants, the sales immediately dropped.  It is a given.  We need to see increased use of EVs and we need a grant scheme that supports their use.  My difficulty with the current grant scheme - the figures bear this out - is that it is disproportionately used by wealthier people living in areas with public transport as opposed to the very people we should be incentivising, those who live in areas without electric vehicles.  The irony is that they are subsidising the new cars through being forced to pay carbon tax because they have no choice other than to drive diesel or petrol cars.  There is an inherent unfairness.<\/p> <p>  It does not make sense to pay out so much in grants to private individuals while we still have tens of thousands of vehicles owned by public bodies which are not EVs.  Many local authority vehicles are not EVs, yet we are giving grants to private individuals.  We still have Garda vehicles that are not EVs.  We cannot just say that this is how it works and this is how we will operate.  We certainly cannot take the position of the SEAI that in the long term poorer people who are currently being penalised will be able to buy second-hand vehicles from the people who got the grants for the new cars.  That appears to be the long-term strategy.  That is inherently unfair and not achieving what we need from an environmental point of view.  I agree with the Chairman that this needs to be analysed before we end up spending &euro;1 billion on EV grants while doing little to reduce transport emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#D00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There are a few issues there to point out to the Department.  Between VRT foregone and the direct grant, it is costing &euro;300 million.  As Deputy Carthy said, in a year or two &euro;1 billion might have been spent.  The scheme needs to be refined because it is clear it is not achieving its original objective.  Previous information the Department supplied indicated there is now a cap on the value of a new vehicle of &euro;60,000.  A vehicle costing more than &euro;60,000 does not qualify for the grant, which helps.  As I recall it, when the Secretary General appeared before the committee, I put it to him that it should be reduced further.  We should not be subsidising large vehicles.  The people who are not benefiting are the very people who are paying the bulk of the carbon tax, have to drive the longest distances and do not have public transport.  We will point that out to the Department in terms of public expenditure.<\/p> <p>  No. 1315 is from Mr. Tom Boland, chairman of Benefacts, dated 17 June 2022.  Having reviewed the committee&rsquo;s correspondence with Departments and State agencies, which we have published, Mr. Boland states that he has written to the committee to correct the record on correspondence we have received from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Rural and Community Development on the closure of the Benefacts database.  Mr. Boland contests a number of statements made by the Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s statement that it &ldquo;does not intend to establish a similar database, as it has no business need for one (it is not in itself a user of Benefacts&rsquo; services).&rdquo;  Mr. Boland states that in 2018 Benefacts was contacted by the pay and pensions unit of the Department and asked to provide a detailed analysis of the pay, pensions and PRSI profile of all non-profit organisations receiving funding from any State source, and that in 2021 an updated version of these data sets was requested by the Department. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s statement that it &ldquo;never had a funding relationship with Benefacts&rdquo; is also contested.  Mr. Boland states that at the request of that Department&rsquo;s social enterprise unit, Benefacts was funded to produce a detailed data set to assist officials in identifying non-profit organisations that might be capable of being recognised by the Department as social enterprises.  There are a number of other contested statements.<\/p> <p>  As well as our correspondence with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we included the closure of Benefacts on the agenda for our meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May this year.  Some members have expressed concern over the termination of the database, given that it is reported that it provided oversight of about &euro;7 billion of public funds that goes to the non-profit sector each year.  The correspondence we received from the Central Statistics Office, No. R1246, on the closure of the database gave rise to further concerns.<\/p><p>It stated that the data it received free of charge from Benefacts was a valuable data source for the CSO across a range of areas and \"helped the CSO fulfil important statistical reporting required under EU legislation\".  In the absence of the Benefacts database, the CSO states that it will need investment across a number of areas.<\/p><p> We have requested sight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's business case for, and the value for money review of, the Benefacts database.  We have also brought the matter and the CSO's correspondence to the attention of the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform.

It is quite a useful and comprehensive letter that raises a number of issues.  The number one issue is value for money.  Some &euro;6.3 million of public money was invested in this database and &euro;250,000 was spent on shutting it down.  There will also be a cost for the CSO, which we can see.  It may be useful to write to the CSO, or the relevant Department, to find out exactly what the nature of the investment would be to allow it to fulfil the EUROSTAT requirements under EU law.<\/p> <p>  Additional money is now being spent on the Department of Rural and Community Development to scope out the creation of a database that would be more limited than that of Benefacts, but that would be an additional cost.  There are serious value for money issues here.  The Indecon report indicated a number of issues that have been referred to, including if it was a question of Benefacts being superseded by another entity, there would be a requirement to have some sort of interim arrangement so we do not have a loss of the information that has been captured in that database, which was used by State and individual organisations.  Many people used this database.  It included audited figures, it was reliable and it was open source.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of misinformation.  I was quite shocked by what we were told on that particular day, before the database was closed down.  I asked the Secretary General if he had read the Indecon report.  He told me he had not but that he had been briefed on it.  We probably all have a copy of the Indecon report.  It is not a difficult document to read; neither is its executive summary.  It well summarises some of the issues.  It states that, when it comes to a cost-benefit analysis, the benefits of the database outweigh the costs, which is not what we are being told.  It really annoys me that we are not getting accurate information.<\/p> <p>  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who took Leaders' Questions.  It is important we note how Benefacts was set up. According to page 2 of the document before me, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's conditions for providing funding include that Benefacts was incorporated as a not-for-profit company; it was limited by guarantee without share capital at the Department's behest, which reflected the public benefit purposes for which it was established; and this meant that the company had no beneficial owners in the commercial sense and that, unlike a for-profit enterprise, was unable to make any medium- or long-term plans based on equity or borrowings.  In his reply to me yesterday, the Minister said that none of the Departments had an interest in contributing towards the funding of this, but he also said they could have raised money from other sources.  There was philanthropy involved in setting Benefacts up but the way the company is structured means it is not open to it to raise money in the way a normal enterprise would.  That was at that Department's own behest.<\/p> <p>  I question why this was shut down.  There was a significant volume of publicly available information.  Sometimes funding comes from multiple sources.  It was very valuable to be able to capture the range of sources of funding.  The more limited thing being talked about by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs does not have that broad look.  We are fixated on the silo-based approach.  Benefacts was the opposite of that.  It took an overview.  That was incredibly valuable.  It is not something that can be captured in value for money terms, but there are aspects of value for money that can be captured.<\/p> <p>  The thing about the Charities Regulator that was repeatedly referred to during committee meetings is disputed in the correspondence.  I would believe what Benefacts is disputing because of the timelines.  The relevant legislation dates to 2009 and the Charities Regulator was set up in 2014 around the same time as Benefacts started.  Benefacts had proof of concept when this proposal was put.  Several things are disputed throughout this document.  It is very thoughtful correspondence, but I feel there was a decision to close Benefacts down even before the Indecon report was commissioned.  I cannot see why we would want to end up with a less transparent arrangement relating to public funding that will cost more.  This is something we should not let go. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#E00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is curious.  What I found strange about it was that in May 2018, when then Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, launched the Benefacts second analysis report at the Royal Irish Academy, he expressed the admiration and support he and his Department had for the Benefacts project.  He stated that he was willing to say he believed the output was crucial and the key thing was that all of this was possible only because Benefacts had done a huge volume of work to assemble all the information that is needed regarding what is happening in the non-profit sector, including the sources of income, the scale of the sector and the output that the sector generates.

Members could say this about their own constituencies.  It has been incredibly difficult to get information on that issue.  This is particularly relevant to the Committee of Public Accounts.  When a cost-benefit analysis of capital spending is done, it is done by building, not necessarily by service, on a CHO basis or by region.  I have broken it down into a small number of questions, with referral notes at the end if people are interested in where those questions came from.  If one is running a regional area, one cannot move people around like chess pieces on a board because of capital investment decisions.  These are people's lives.  However, we are only doing cost-benefit analysis by building and we are not looking at all the buildings as a community when it comes to mental health, disability, or whatever else it might be.  That seems to be the case with this CHO.  Is the HSE okay with this on a national basis?<\/p> <p>  If we move to Sl&aacute;intecare and a more regional model, will we continue to do cost-benefit analysis and capital investment on a piecemeal basis instead of looking at particular regions and how everything slots together?  One can see quickly from the notes I have attached that bits and bobs are happening all over the place, with an investment here and a rental there.  There does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  When thinking of cost-benefit analysis, every regional area is almost like a campus and should be looked at as a whole.

I am not saying that every one of the recommendations should not have been implemented, but there have been significant changes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit in respect of strategic housing developments, which is where many of the issues are focused.  We are going to have some difficulty having a satisfactory meeting in advance of the publication of that report.  I know that the regulator is doing another review of the structures and procedures of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We do not know when the regulator will complete that or whether or not that will be a public document.  It might be worth writing to the regulator - whether that is appropriate or not is something we might consider - just to see exactly what the intention is there.  The checks and balances should not be down to an individual; they should be down to the structures being robust enough to make sure that issues do not arise.  I am sure that is why the regulator is in there.  The regulator is going to be important in the context of the current issues.  One of the issues we talked about the last time was the fact that one third of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's budget is now being spent on legal challenges in respect of judicial reviews.

I get the Deputy Murphy eile's point about the review that is ongoing.  Notwithstanding that, I recently took the opportunity to read back over the transcript of our last hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I recall, even as far back as my time as a councillor, that the issues that have arisen were flagged up as very likely scenarios.  When you have a system whereby a group of people - in some cases very small groups of people - sit behind closed doors making decisions and are not accountable for those decisions unless somebody has the funds to take them to the High Court, there needs to be the maximum level of accountability and transparency.  There is clearly a governance failure and a culture failure within the board that needs to be challenged.  There is plenty for us to engage with, and the Department is an important component in that.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that we keep our work plan flexible enough that if we need to bring An Bord Plean&aacute;la back before the committee after the publication of the report, we can do so.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, this is about tens of millions of euro spent on legal fees in fights against what was ostensibly the exact same position of the board, with the board losing every single time but continuing to go back.  It appears that nobody within An Bord Plean&aacute;la said that this needed to be analysed and assessed and that nobody within the Department asked what was going on here.  Yet representatives of An Bord Plean&aacute;la came into a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, where we deal with every Department and have limited time to go over documents, and several members were able to point out issues.  The board dismissed the potential of an issue, and now we find out about all sorts of further reviews that will probably cost further millions in their outworkings.  It will be one of the most important hearings of our term to date.  I suggest we ensure that we create the capacity to have An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the committee a second time if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I have another suggestion for our future work plan if the Chair is dealing with them now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#H01000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Hold it until we have dealt with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#H01100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>May I ask a question of the Comptroller and Auditor General?

The associated activities and running costs are funded under two Votes.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 27 - International Co-operation, records gross expenditure of nearly &euro;548 million.  This represents around 63% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development and humanitarian assistance.  The programmes funded under the Vote are administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division.  The assistance is provided mainly on a bilateral basis, in direct co-operation with Government agencies in a number of targeted programme countries, or through a wide range of non-governmental agency partners.  There is also significant voted expenditure on a multilateral basis, including in support of specialised UN relief and development agencies.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the remainder of the Department&rsquo;s areas of operation is charged to Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs.  Gross expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;256 million in 2020.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes, defined in terms of broad strategic objectives.  About three quarters of the expenditure was in the nature of administration expenses, including staff costs and the costs to provide Ireland's network of embassies and missions abroad.  Most of the non-administrative expenses comprised annual contributions to a range of international organisations and grants to support services for Irish emigrants.  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to the issuing of passports and visas and other consular services.  In 2020, receipts of that nature amounted to just over &euro;34 million, representing 89% of the overall receipts retained in the account.  The 2020 fee receipts represented little more than half of the corresponding receipts in 2019.  This was primarily due to a significant drop in the level of passport applications in 2020, which the Department attributes to reduced demand for international travel due to Covid-19.<\/p><p>Because of the way in which Vote 28 is structured, the staffing and other resources dedicated to the Passport Office are not identifiable in the account.  However, the annual Estimate for the Vote, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, indicates that the expenditure in relation to Passport Office activity is charged to programme A, our people.<\/p><p> The Estimate for Vote 28 also discloses that the number of passports issued fell very significantly, from the peak level of almost 937,000 in 2019 to just over 450,000 in 2020.  Despite the very significant drop in the volume of applications completed, the timeliness of delivery also fell back, as indicated in the Department&rsquo;s performance reporting.  In 2020, 88% of online passport applications were processed within 20 days.  This compares to 98% of online passport applications processed within the same time period in 2019.  For the typically more complicated paper-based passport applications, 87% were processed within 30 working days in 2020.  This was just marginally behind the 88% processed within the same time period in 2019.<\/p><p> Given the nature and scale of operation of the Passport Office, there may be merit in considering whether it should have its own expenditure programme within Vote 28 and for the related application fee receipts to be separately itemised in the appropriations-in-aid listing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The Secretary General, Mr. Joe Hackett, has asked me to convey his apologies for not being able to attend today due to illness.  I know he would want to have been here to answer the committee's questions in his role as the Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting us to the committee to discuss the 2020 appropriation accounts for the Department of Foreign Affairs - Votes 27 and 28.  We have provided the committee a summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2020.<\/p> <p>  The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strategy statement 2017-2020, which set out the Department&rsquo;s work in five main areas: serving Irish citizens; actively engaging in the European Union; promoting Ireland&rsquo;s values internationally; advancing Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity; and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s influence.<\/p> <p>  Vote 27 is structured around a single expenditure programme, namely, Ireland&rsquo;s work on development and humanitarian assistance, also known as Irish Aid.<\/p> <p>  The year under review, 2020, was a hugely challenging one for the public service.  For our Department, it meant re-prioritising and repurposing a number of our programmes to address unprecedented domestic and international challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, while ensuring that we did not let our focus slip from key priorities such as Northern Ireland, Brexit, our overseas development programme and winning Ireland&rsquo;s seat on the UN Security Council.<\/p> <p>  Our largest citizen service, the passport service, was required to significantly adapt its service in compliance with Government public health guidance.  The closure of the public offices during the different phases of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, which was essential from a public health perspective, coupled with the fall in demand for passports due to the travel restrictions, required us to alter our service provision.  This, combined with the pent-up demand for passports not renewed in 2020 and 2021, means we are still working through the effects of Covid-19 restrictions.  I know this is an issue of particular concern to the committee and I look forward to answering members' questions hand outlining the steps the Department has taken to address these issues to ensure the efficiency the public expects from the passport service is delivered.<\/p> <p>  During this year, we have made intensive efforts to significantly improve passport application processing times.  By international standards, Ireland continues to produce one of the most highly regarded products in the world.  With over 90% of applications now submitted online through a very user-friendly system, turnaround times for renewals in particular are efficient and very competitive when compared internationally.  So far this year, we have produced almost 700,000 passports, by far the largest number ever produced for a six-month period.  However, I acknowledge that our customer service response to queries to our call centre has fallen short of the service we want to provide.  This is not acceptable for our customers and I apologise.  I assure the committee that we are focusing on addressing this challenge as a matter of priority, including through the temporary recruitment of call centre staff previously engaged by the HSE.<\/p> <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 response, we also sought to support other Departments with their emergency response.  In addition to the redeployment of staff within the Department to meet the challenges we faced, 163 staff members from the Passport Office were redeployed to the Department of Social Protection to assist with the processing of the pandemic unemployment payments, PUP, and to the HSE to assist with contact tracing.<\/p> <p>  While the demand for passports fell away during the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for our emergency consular services increased to a level the Department had never previously experienced.  To ensure an effective consular response to this global crisis, our consular directorate was restructured and substantially reinforced at an early stage.  Demonstrating impressive solidarity across the Department, 150 additional colleagues, both at headquarters and overseas, received special consular training, with up to 80 officers temporarily redeployed to the reinforced Covid-19 consular response team at any one time.  With this reinforced consular team, we provided assistance, support and advice to more than 9,000 Irish citizens who were stranded overseas.  We directly chartered aircraft to facilitate three large-scale repatriations from Peru, India and Nigeria and worked with airlines to facilitate dedicated repatriation flights from Australia and the UK.  We also worked closely with our European and other partners to ensure that Irish citizens could avail of repatriation flights arranged by other countries and, through our mission network, assisted Irish citizens to secure seats on commercial flights.<\/p> <p>  We also recognised at an early stage the potential negative impact of the pandemic on our diaspora communities.  To mitigate this impact, a dedicated Covid-19 response fund for Irish communities abroad was established, funded through our emigrant support programme and focused on support for the elderly and newly vulnerable; mitigating the impact of social isolation; responding to individual cases of exceptional hardship; providing mental health supports and bereavement counselling; and moving more services online.<\/p> <p>  I will now give a brief overview of some of our other priorities in the Department during 2020.  As the committee will be aware, in 2020 we entered the final phase of the process that ultimately saw Ireland take a seat on the UN Security Council.  We are now in the second half of our two-year term on the Security Council.  Since taking up our seat last year, we have been active across the full council agenda, bringing our principled and independent perspective to a range of key issues, in line with the core principles for our term, namely, building peace, strengthening conflict prevention and ensuring accountability.  We have achieved some considerable successes despite the very challenging council dynamics and the changes in the working environment due to Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  From a development co-operation perspective, the year was defined by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the United Nations system at the heart of an integrated and urgent global response.  The allocation of almost &euro;550 million to Vote 27 enabled the Department, through the Irish Aid programme, to move quickly, with &euro;150 million allocated over the course of the year in support of that global response.  This included quadrupling Irish funding to the World Health Organization, WHO, to &euro;16 million and investing in the COVAX facility to ensure vaccine access.  This leveraged Irish Aid&rsquo;s work over many years building public health system capacity in developing countries, which enabled targeted engagements with health ministries, including supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, infection control measures and establishing ICU capabilities.<\/p> <p>  Recognising that this was more than a health crisis, Irish Aid funding enabled people to cope with the wider impacts of the pandemic through enabling social protection systems, allowing children to continue their education and a focus on reducing gender-based violence.  In addition, our focus on humanitarian assistance to those most vulnerable was maintained.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to humanitarian action is an expression of our values, supported by our financial investment which in 2020 was just over &euro;190 million.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland and managing the outcome of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union continued to be key priorities for the Department in 2020.  In particular, the New Decade, New Approach agreement in January 2020 represented a significant shared achievement of the political parties in Northern Ireland with the Irish and British Governments.  We also sustained engagement in Brussels, across the EU, in London, Washington and at home on addressing and mitigating the economic and political consequences of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the programme for Government moved trade promotion back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  My Department continues to work collaboratively at headquarters and through the mission network to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s trade and investment objectives and to promote Ireland as a great place in which to live, work, do business, invest and visit.  The Global Ireland 2025 strategy offers a framework and ambition for this ongoing collaboration across government.  In addition, our mission capacity overseas and our network of relationships were key to our consular and diaspora response in 2020.  We have recently opened 14 new missions, without which it would have been much more difficult to provide the consular support required in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular to repatriate citizens from locations such as Peru, Colombia, Chile and New Zealand.<\/p> <p>  I also want to acknowledge the dedication and motivation of the Department&rsquo;s staff.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 crisis had and continues to have a profound impact on the Department's global operating environment, including on staffing, security and ICT functions.  The crisis has underlined the importance of investment in workforce planning, building resilience, supporting well-being for staff in challenging situations a long way from home, supporting remote working and engagement via digital platforms, and investing in health and safety and security of staff who serve our citizens and promote our interests overseas.<\/p><p> I am joined this morning by the director general for development co-operation, Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca; the director of the Passport Service, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Byrne; and Ms Jane Connolly, who is the director of the finance division.

People are in tears on the phone.  People ring the Passport Office hundreds of times, over and over, trying to get through to it and there is not a peep.<\/p><p> The uploading of photographs was mentioned.  I came across several issues with constituents who had applied for a passport.  For example, a constituent uploaded the photograph online and was given a target date.  The target date had passed and my constituent was starting to get a bit panicky.  She checked and saw a message to say the photograph had not uploaded.  She uploaded it again but got no confirmation at all.  She phoned the Passport Office.  Obviously, she would still be ringing them waiting for an answer.  My constituent uploaded it three times to be then told she had exceeded the security attempt.  Ironically, she was told to contact the Passport Office.  She contacted my office.  When we eventually got through, we were told by somebody there is a problem sometimes if photographs are uploaded with a phone and it is better to do it on the laptop.  Why, in the name of God, are people not told that rather than having them checking repeatedly?  That is only one example of simple things that could be rectified.  There are simple changes that could reduce the stress levels of people that have been caused by the Passport Office.<\/p><p> Another one, which is a bone of contention, is the target date.  When the Passport Service is seeking further information, sometimes it is after the target date that contact is made with the person to seek further information.  They scurry around and get that further information only to be told they are to the back of the queue.  Where does that make sense?  Why was that system let go unchecked?  Why is it still operational as of this week that people, despite the fact they were only contacted after their target date, submit the further information to be told they are at the back of the queue?  Many people have missed their chance of a holiday.  They have had two years of a pandemic.  Many people have set holidays.  If they work in certain areas, they are given two weeks in July or two weeks in June and they have no option to change their holidays.  Many families have been looking forward to their first holiday in possibly three years only to be told the passport has not arrived in time, so they miss their holiday and have no other option but to stay at home for their two weeks and think maybe next year they might get away or, as in multiple cases, a single family member does not get his or her passport on time when other members have and that person has to stay at home.  It beggars belief.  I am not being rude, but it is utter incompetence having a system whereby a target date is given, the person is not contacted, and when he or she is contacted for further information, that person goes to the back of the queue.<\/p><p> There is another issue about watermarks.  There was another constituent who had submitted the birth certificate three times to be accused wrongly of sending in copies.  My office spoke to someone who issues civil legal documentation and was told there was a problem in the Passport Office reading watermarks.  Is that true?  Has it been corrected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#DD06500","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656577800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Briefly, on the queuing and going back to the back of the queue, we heard what people had to say on that and we have now changed that.

The person says her family holiday is booked on the 6th and is told she must wait another fortnight.  Why is there no emphasis put on those who submit - Mr. Conlan said early the bulk of the backlog is waiting for further information - given the fact they have applied for their passport in ample time?  They have applied in sufficient time, for example, two months.  I could cite a list of cases here only it would take up my ten minutes.  They are disgraceful.

Time is limited, so I will try to keep them concise and I ask the witnesses to try to do the same with their answers.  Regarding the Garda verification of passports, I had a situation where a constituent had a passport application witnessed at the Garda station in Edenderry, which is a town of approximately 11,000 people.  The person works in Dublin, as many people living in Edenderry do.  Dublin is 40 or 45 miles away.  People are away all day and it could be 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock before they get home in the evening.  The garda in the station in Edenderry witnessed the application and did the whole process.  A situation then arose where the Passport Office could not contact the Garda station in Edenderry because it was not a 24-hour station.  I then posted a message on my Facebook page advising people to go to either Tullamore or Portlaoise in Laois-Offaly because those are 24-hour stations.<\/p> <p>  Is Ms Byrne saying that such a situation cannot arise now?

I believe it is called Ireland House.  Currently, many State services are being run out of Dubai for quite a large part of the Middle East, even Egypt and other locations.  It is crucial for the likes of Bord Bia and other State agencies to have a base on the African continent where they could operate for that region.<\/p> <p>  I come from a farming background.  There has been political instability in north Africa and I know there was a huge drive for democracy there; one of the major catalysts in that respect was the increase in food prices.  It is really worrying to see even the minimum progress - it is not perfect - being put at risk in 2023.  We can look at the grain port of Mariupol and the Ukrainian harvest that will not reach the market.  Egypt, for example, was the largest supporter of Ukrainian grain and the single largest net importer of grain in the world, if I am correct.  I am using Egypt as an example but those countries in North Africa are crying out for new sources of agrifood products.  There are individual concerns relating to the procurement processes around how to obtain food, where it is government-controlled rather than market-led.  The Department of Foreign Affairs could make a big difference to Irish agriculture by focusing on that area.<\/p> <p>  I am a Corkonian and I raise the fact that all printing of passports happens in Dublin.  I do not want to be overly populist and I appreciate the reason for the backlog in passports was down to the human resources side of things, as Ms Byrne indicates.  Passport machines are capable of printing even more than they are now but the paperwork has to be done for that.<\/p> <p>  If somebody completes the documentation, it is an unmerciful journey to go from Castletownbere, Kerry, Wexford, Waterford and Tipperary to Balbriggan in north Dublin in order to collect a passport in an emergency.  There is much merit in having at least one machine in the south of the country, particularly any location with good road connectivity.  It would make a mighty difference.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, often in these circumstances, as I am sure the witnesses are far more aware of than we are, there can be incredible tragedy involved where people are required to collect a passport in an emergency situation.

There is a coherent Irish offer to countries on the continent of Africa, in order that we can build and share and learn how to do climate-smart agriculture that gives everybody quick nutrition wins.<\/p><p> We are looking at certain areas of Irish expertise, in particular, including good seeds.  In Ireland, one gets approximately 16 tonnes of potatoes per hectare in productivity.  In Kenya, one gets about 5 tonnes.  We are sharing our expertise, not just on seeds, but on storage and value chains, so that it is also about value addition in business.  We are doing that but there is more we can do and there are more partnerships we can build with the Irish farming sector on that.  We are on a journey.  We also have a small scheme between our Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we provide seed capital for Irish agribusiness to look at business opportunities in Africa in partnership with African companies.  That is part of that journey.<\/p><p> I will pick up on the Deputy point about Egypt.  I had a conversation last night with an Egyptian lady who was here yesterday and who met colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine precisely to look at where partnerships could be taken forward between Ireland and Egypt around better food, with a view to doing something in advance of the Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of the Parties, COP, climate change conference in November.<\/p><p> We are trying to use the aid programme as smartly as we can both to find opportunities for Ireland and to address the global food crisis.  While we have to invest in systems to get better food to grow, there is an emerging hunger crisis because of what is going on in Ukraine, specifically in the Horn of Africa about which some Deputies got a briefing in the past week or two.

That is the human aspect of it.  The aspect we are discussing at this meeting is the Irish money and other EU funds that are going in there but the human aspect is the most important part of it.  It is appalling that Israel feels it can just drive a bulldozer through this.  I would ask the Department to take a strong line with the Israeli authorities and with the embassy here.  We are taking a strong line on Russia, and rightly so.  This might be overshadowed by the war in Ukraine but the suffering in Palestine since 1947 is outrageous.  This State, the Irish people and Palestinian support groups have played a positive role in trying to highlight that suffering and it is important that we do that.  We may be falsely accused of being other things because we raise it.

It would cost an additional &euro;300,000 to support those machines for a year.  A significant investment would need to be made in making such a decision.

I am pleased to report to the committee on the participation of the Irish Defence Forces in United Nations missions in 2020 and 2021.  These reports were laid before the D&aacute;il on 21 June 2021 and on 30 March 2022, respectively.  The following motion were placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and have been referred to this committee.  The first one is that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister of Defence regarding service of the Defence Forces in the United Nations in 2020, a copy of which was laid before the D&aacute;il on the 21 June 2021 in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.  The second one is that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding services of the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2021, a copy of which was laid before the D&aacute;il on 30 March 2022 in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.<\/p> <p>  In commending the motions, I want to briefly outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the UN in 2020 and 2021.  There are currently some 546 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas in nine different missions around the world.  During 2021 and 2020, notwithstanding the significant challenges presented by Covid-19, our Defence Forces personnel deployed as usual to UN-led and UN authorised missions.  The exceptional circumstances of the pandemic required rotating troops to quarantine in military installations for a two week period immediately prior to their departure and again on arrival in the mission area.<\/p> <p>  I will start with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL.  The UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon, where Ireland as lead nation partners with Polish, Hungarian and Maltese troops, represents Ireland's largest overseas peace support deployment.  I have had the opportunity to visit our troops in the Lebanon twice in the last six months.  Most recently, just last month I accompanied the Taoiseach on a visit to the UNIFIL mission to mark the International Day of UN Peacekeepers.  The valuable contribution the mission and our troops are making to international peace and security in the Middle East was, and is, very evident.  <\/p> <p>  The United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, is Ireland's second largest overseas deployment and is on the Golan Heights.  A contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces has been deployed to UNDOF since 2013 and the presence of the mission remains an important element in ensuring the continued ceasefire between Israel and Syria and in the wider Middle East region.  <\/p> <p>  The next is the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, or MINUSMA as it will be known to most members.  Last year the Government approved the continued provision of up to 14 Defence Forces personnel to participate in MINUSMA, drawn primarily from the Army ranger wing.  The United Nations led operation in Mali will be until 30 September 2022.  All deployed personnel are embedded with a larger German company and are carrying out assigned tasks in accordance with the mission's mandate.  Having originally deployed for a period of two years, which was subsequently extended for a third year, our participation in this mission will conclude in September this year.<\/p> <p>  The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO, and the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, are primarily staff or military observer missions with Ireland's personnel providing a valuable role in monitoring ceasefires and avoiding any escalation in these important but volatile regions.  Following a review of overseas deployments in 2021, a decision was taken to withdraw the two Defence Forces personnel deployed to MINURSO, in western Sahara, and end Ireland's involvement in this mission.  The withdrawal of these personnel arose from a need to consolidate operational deployments in the context of additional commitments to peacekeeping entered into by Ireland in recent years.  It certainly does not represent a change in policy towards Western Sahara.<\/p> <p>  Other UN mandated missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2020 and 2021 include the EU mission to train the armed forces in Mali, known as European Union Training Mission, the EUTM; EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, or EUFOR as it is known; and the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo or KFOR, as it is known.  <\/p> <p>  Ireland is in its second year on the UN Security Council and while membership of the Security Council is an honour, it also brings with it great responsibility.  Since January 2021, we have engaged actively across the Council's broad agenda and played a constructive role in bringing pragmatism and principle to the Council table, not least during our Presidency of the Council last September.  In September 2021, I presided over the unanimous adoption of a UN Security Council resolution, spearheaded by Ireland, on peacekeeping.  For the record, it is only the second ever Irish-led resolution that has been passed in the Security Council, which is interesting.  UN Security Council Resolution 2594 was the first UN Security Council resolution devoted to the transition from peacekeeping to peace-building in countries - in other words, how you manage your exit while supporting and maintaining stability in a former conflict zone.  It is an area where Ireland is developing quite a lot of credibility working in partnership with other UN members.  Between now and the end of our term, we will continue to play a constructive and thoughtful role and support the vital work of promoting peace and international security.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, I commend the members of the Defence Forces on their commitment to overseas service.  I thank them for their significant contribution to UN peacekeeping.  In many ways, they are Irish ambassadors in uniform in parts of the world that are volatile and sometimes dangerous.  They are protecting and supporting people who they have never met and, in some cases, they never will meet, in parts of the world that need a UN peacekeeping presence which Ireland has been involved in every day for 60 years.  I know the committee members will agree with me when I say that our Defence Forces personnel serving in missions to date, have built up an outstanding reputation as committed, conscientious professional and humane peacekeepers.<\/p><p>Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas under the auspices of the UN simply would not be possible.  I commend the motions to the committee and I am happy to take any questions that members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#A00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

There have been over 70,000 individual tours of duty carried out by members of the Defence Forces, which is a phenomenal record and something of which we should be very proud.  It has built up the soft power that we as a small nation have created across the globe.  It is something we should and can build on as an active neutral country.  That is as opposed to any move towards being a militarily-aligned country.  It is something I want to see further developed.<\/p> <p>  It should be said, nevertheless, that there are difficulties and the Minister is acutely aware of these, particularly when a representative body like the Representative Body of Commissioned Officers, RACO, has said quite recently that our obligations to the UN are at serious risk because of the recruitment and retention difficulties within the Defence Forces.  They are jeopardising our involvement in some of these missions.  Will the Minister comment on that?  I know the commission report will be central to this matter and particularly retention issues.  We are currently 1,000 members of the Defence Forces short of the establishment numbers.  Will the Minister speak to the difficulties we are currently experiencing or whether the Minister sees any difficulties in meeting that mandate?<\/p> <p>  Following from that is the question of mandatory selection for some of the missions because of those difficulties with numbers.  That in itself is creating difficulties for members of the Defence Forces who have just returned from overseas deployment.  Due to the shortage of skilled or qualified personnel in different areas, members are being selected on a mandatory basis for deployment.  That creates its own challenges in family and personal lives, as well as everything that goes with it.<\/p> <p>  I asked the Minister via a parliamentary question what records are kept about mandatory selection for deployment, along with appeals upheld or overturned.  It was quite shocking that there is no centralised system of recording that information.  It was indicated in the reply to the parliamentary question that a system would be put in place to record the information on how many appeals were taken by members of the Defence Forces on mandatory selection and whether the appeals were upheld or overturned.  Will the Minister give us an update on that, because this has a major impact on both individuals and families?<\/p> <p>  I will also touch on the training mission to Mali.

I will speak to the EU training mission.  The Minister is acutely aware of the difficulties in Mali and the involvement of the Wagner Group Russian mercenaries there.  We were part of training troops in Mali and it is widely reported they were involved with all sorts of horrendous crimes, including murder and butchery, and that included members of the Wagner Group.  The French have pulled out of that training mission and it has certainly put Irish troops in a difficult position.<\/p> <p>  What is the situation with that training mission?  It must be said, as my party did at the outset, that it breached the triple lock mechanism we have in place.  I know the Defence (Amendment) Act was introduced in 2006 to allow that type of training mission to take place but the training mission had no D&aacute;il approval whatsoever to allow our troops to participate.  Will the Minister give his view on that?  It breached whatever limited safeguards we have in place with the triple lock because there was no D&aacute;il approval.<\/p> <p>  I ask specifically about the triple lock, which gives us limited protections for our neutrality.  The Minister and other members of the Government are on record saying they do not believe it is fit for purpose and there are serious challenges there.

They are doing a great job there.  I have also been to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, although not recently because one cannot get to UNDOF now without going through Damascus, which is impossible for a Minister.  It is unfortunate that it is almost impossible to visit our troops in UNDOF but I get reports from there.  I have been to the training mission in Mali as well.

That has put pressure on our systems and not only with the Naval Service, as is well documented now with regard to ships.<\/p><p>There were also pressures on the Air Corps and there has been pressure on the Army.  They have done well to manage that pressure in terms of shortages of people.  Certainly, some specialties have caused difficulty and that has resulted in some of the people on rotation being there under mandatory selection rather than voluntary selection.  That is not where we want to be.  However, it is important not to give the impression that everyone who is overseas is there on a mandatory basis as they are not.  I have spent quite a bit of time speaking to our Defence Forces personnel overseas about these issues and the vast majority are very happy to be there and want to be there, and most of the people who are there under mandatory selection also recognise that there are pressure points that they are being asked to help resolve until we get the numbers up to where they need to be.<\/p><p> I do not have detail of the numbers in terms of the number of appeals around mandatory selection but I can try to get that for the Deputy - I will have to ask the Chief of Staff for that.  I want to recognise that it is an issue but also that the overall picture in terms of overseas service continues to be remarkably positive.  Clearly, we need to get at least our establishment number back to where it should be.  I also suspect that the commission report&rsquo;s recommendations will be accepted by the Government on the issue of increasing the establishment number, or I certainly hope that will be the case in the next couple of weeks, when I bring recommendations to the Government.  In my view, we need a bigger Defence Forces with more resources so we can address the pressure points that the Deputy recognises and go on to do more, because there is a huge appetite in the Defence Forces for peacekeeping overseas.<\/p><p> I would also like to mention that, over the next decade or so, we will see the kind of missions that we commit to changing and probably see them becoming more complex.  As Ireland's reputation is so good in terms of peacekeeping, I think we will see the UN ask us to be involved in more Chapter VII missions, which effectively are peace enforcement missions.  They are, by their nature, more challenging in terms of training, equipment and everything from the grade of armour to the firepower, and so on.  That takes time in terms of investment and training, and building up for those kinds of more complex Chapter VII missions which I suspect Ireland will be asked to contribute to in the future.  Unfortunately, we are not short of conflicts around the world where there is going to be a need for peacekeeping intervention, and the best countries need to be there, particularly for the most complex missions, when those missions are justified, of course.<\/p><p> I want to give that background and context in terms of the work that is ongoing between the Department and the Defence Forces and in terms of our civil-military teams assessing not only where we are this year and next year, but where we might be in 2027 in 2028 in terms of future peacekeeping missions and so on.  That kind of planning is necessary because the processes of upgrading, training and new equipment, and the associated tendering processes and procurement, takes years with regard to defence equipment.<\/p><p> In terms of the European Union Training Mission, EUTM, we did not ignore the triple lock because as this is a training mission, it did not require the triple lock, or that is my understanding of it anyway.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#B01400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":799,"content":"<p>The Government brought in an amendment to the legislation to bypass the triple lock.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#C00200","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":800,"content":"<p>No, we did not.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#C00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":801,"content":"<p>That is the case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#C00400","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":802,"content":"<p>It is just like the situation where we did not need to go through a triple lock process to send a ship to the Mediterranean because it was not a UN mission.

The people who are responsible for the coup are at a different level entirely and the Deputy should not be making the connection between the two, given the accusation that comes from that.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the continuing presence, we are likely to see some changes to that EU training mission but, for now, the view in the EU is that maintaining a presence there is still more beneficial than leaving.  There are, of course, real concerns in regard to the presence of the Wagner Group, which is effectively a Russian-backed mercenary group that has huge resources and has a real and corrosive impact in different parts of Africa and, increasingly, in Mali.  There is no way we can stand over training troops to operate in parallel with the Wagner Group.  Obviously, those considerations are being managed at an EU level at the moment and Ministers are being kept informed.  For now, we are there but we will keep that mission under close review.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the triple lock more generally, what I have said is that I cannot recall a time when the triple lock has prevented us from sending Irish Defence Forces personnel and peacekeepers to a part of the world where we believe they can make a positive contribution and, therefore, it has not not been a big priority for me to change.  Theoretically, though, the triple lock is a problem.  Are we happy with a situation where, effectively, a member of the permanent five on the Security Council can veto where Ireland chooses to send its Defence Forces personnel, particularly given what is happening at the moment in the context of Russia's aggression in Ukraine?<\/p><p>If, for example, Russia decided not to allow the mandate in Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue just because it did not like it, would that mean that Irish troops would have to leave?  These are questions that we have to have an honest discussion around.<\/p><p> I am a big believer in Irish neutrality in the context of military non-alignment.  I am not proposing that we change that.  However, I am proposing that Irish neutrality - it does not mean political neutrality, by the way - should allow Ireland to decide where and when we send our troops.  I do not believe that we should be prevented from doing so by a decision that may be made in the Kremlin or any of the other capitals of the Security Council's permanent five members, P5.  That is a potential future problem with the triple lock.  It has been a theoretical issue that people have raised at various times in recent years, but it has never been as real a potential blockage as it is now in terms of UN mandates to maintain peacekeeping missions and create new ones, given the tension that there currently is within the Security Council, which makes it difficult to agree anything.  The triple lock may become a problem.  We have to be open to changing it and honest about how we do that while protecting what we want to protect.<\/p><p> A Government decision, a D&aacute;il decision and some other mechanism that can ensure that our peacekeeping missions are in the spirit of the UN and what it is trying to do around peace support and peacekeeping are important.  I hope that, at the start of the next term, we can have a discussion on the matter.  This is not about trying to undermine the basis on which we send troops abroad for peacekeeping purposes.  Rather, it is about the practicalities of not being vetoed by a country or countries that have a different perspective to us on world affairs in terms of peacekeeping and conflict.  I am afraid that we are being reminded of that every day in the images we are seeing from Ukraine.<\/p><p> That is my issue with the triple lock.  Most Irish people would say \"No\" if asked whether they were happy that Russia had a veto over where Irish troops went, but that is effectively what the triple lock could mean if the relationships and difficulties on the Security Council remain as they are.<\/p><p> I believe I have covered most of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#C02200","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":821,"content":"<p>The difficulty is you are better off having people within the UN than outside it.

The Minister referred to the changing and complex nature of UN missions.  In recent weeks, this committee has heard about the concerning and serious potential for future conflicts caused by a myriad of reasons, including climate change.  It is becoming clear that an increasing number of regions are facing instability and that the UN is likely to view them as needing peacebuilding and peacekeeping.  Something else that has become clear, and on which previous witnesses before this committee have agreed, is that the establishment of peace is one thing, but maintaining it is a separate piece of work.  Based on the experience of our Defence Forces on overseas missions, which we all recognise, in what roles could they be involved as part of a future UN mission?  Are there fields or emerging roles in which our Defence Forces could be playing a significant part?  How does the Commission on the Defence Forces fit into that scenario?<\/p> <p>  None of us is comfortable with the idea of mandatory overseas selection outside of special skill sets being required due to staff shortages.  However, if there is a role where we see a potential increase for our involvement, do we have the capability to increase our Defence Forces' numbers, specialist training and equipment in that regard? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#D00900","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":829,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  The changing nature of peacekeeping is almost self-evident.  I will give a good example.  The previous time we were on the Security Council was in 2001 when 9-11 tragically happened.  There has also been a great deal of tragedy this time, be it Afghanistan, Covid, Ukraine or many other conflicts.<\/p><p>I understand that, in 2001, the Security Council was dealing with 13 files in terms of conflicts.  Today, it is dealing with over 30.  That gives a sense of how significant the number of increased conflicts has been over that period of 20 years.  It is hugely complex.  We can all name them, from Afghanistan to Syria, Yemen, Libya and Ethiopia.  It is a long list.<\/p><p> We are likely to see climate change impacting also on the acceleration of conflicts and tension in different parts of the world but, in particular, in already vulnerable parts of the world such as the Sahel in Africa and other parts of the Middle East.  Peacekeeping in the future is likely to be less conventional in terms of keeping two countries apart and may well be more regional in terms of trying to manage the movement of people and the tensions that causes.  Of course, it may well be trying to interrupt and prevent conflicts in the future which are more complex Chapter VII-type missions than observation missions or Chapter VI missions.  That requires a great deal of extra training and an a great deal of extra equipment in terms of keeping the Defence Force personnel safe or as safe as we can make it in that kind of theatre and environment.  Those, as I say, are the conversations that we are having.<\/p><p> Something we are doing from a policy perspective - this is where foreign policy and defence policy crosses over - is questioning how the UN plans for, invests in and manages the transition out of a peacekeeping mission into what follows so that one does not have peacekeepers on the ground indefinitely and countries relying on them being there.  If one looks at the UNIFIL and UNDOF missions, they have been there for a very long time.  If one looks at the peacekeeping mission in Somalia, for example, we are trying to manage a transition where tens of thousands of foreign soldiers no longer need to be there but that we would build up resilience within domestic systems around policing and defence capacity in a responsible way that does not contribute potentially to a new conflict.  None of this is easy but it is why we were the authors of a resolution that got unanimous support that now requires the Secretary General to report back to the Security Council on peacekeeping transitions on the investment that the UN and its agencies are making in facilitating that transition over time from a blunt peacekeeping operation to something more stable.  Ireland is well placed to be right in the middle of that policy, and the actioning of that on the ground.  We have some experience in different parts of the world in those kind of transitions that involve politics as well as defence capacity.<\/p><p> As for how the commission fits into it, the commission will be central to everything for the future of the Defence Forces for the next number of decades.  We will, hopefully, approve the memorandum that has come out of the commission report in the next ten days or so in government and it will give a clear signal as to where we are going in terms of increased resources, increased numbers and increased infrastructure.  This is about upsizing the Defence Forces and their capacity, not downsizing, and ensuring that we get value for money in that but also spending much more money because that is what is needed to deal with the capacity issues that are required to be addressed in order that the Defence Forces can deliver what we ask of them.  There is a gap between the resources they have and what we plan to ask the Defences Forces to do in terms of defence policy, whether that is in the White Paper or, indeed, evolving asks as we move into a different global environment given what is happening in Ukraine right now.  For example, in the short term, we are not waiting for the commission report.  We have already made a decision in relation to increasing the role of the Reserve, for example, so that it will be possible for reservists to serve overseas.  We have already moved towards a more family-friendly policy and flexibilities for Defence Force personnel serving overseas where some people in certain circumstances can choose to go on a three-month rotation rather than a six-month rotation recognising family pressures and we would pair two people up for a six-month rotation so that each of them would do three months each.  That kind of thinking, which we would not have seen five years ago, is now very much evident in terms of how we manage our people in the Defence Forces recognising the need for more flexibility, more family-family friendly policies and a range of other issues as well in terms of how we deal with issues such as maternity leave in the Defence Forces.  Much of that is evolving and changing for the better.<\/p><p> Most importantly, we simply need more people across all elements of the Defence Forces.  We will build a much bigger cyber command within the Defence Forces.  Certainly, if one looks at what we are proposing to do within the Naval Service, we want to move to what is called double-crewing, which means an extra 700 people in the Naval Service, but that cannot happen overnight.  That is a process that will take four, five, six or seven years and we need to have funding certainty to be able to make sure that we can plan for that and deliver it.  All of that will flow from the commission's evidence base and recommendations, and obviously a Government decision which I do not have yet but I hope to have before we break up for the summer recess to be able start that process of quite dramatic transformation of the Defence Forces for the better in terms of restructuring, changing the culture but also, significantly, increasing the resources that are available to bring about that change.  If that plan works, and I certainly hope it will, it will give us options in terms of peacekeeping abroad.  Certainly, it means that I hope we will not have to rely on mandatory selection in terms of people going overseas but we would have more than enough people volunteering for positions, whether they be reservists supplementing what the Permanent Defence Force is doing or Permanent Defence Force members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#D01000","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":831,"content":"<p>In relation to members of the Reserve the Minister mentioned, does he see them taking on a greater role in terms of specialist expertise or areas of specialist expertise?

The Defence Forces contribution to national cybersecurity issues will increase, probably in terms of the partnership in the National Cyber Security Centre.  That may involve more Defence Forces involvement but that is to be discussed by Government.  Certainly, within the Defence Forces, we need to build more capacity and resilience there, and we will do that.  We have people seconded to other centres of excellence around Europe, obviously, learning and training, etc., so that we can benefit from other countries' developments, ideas and skill sets.<\/p> <p>  On the Reserve, there is a role for the Reserve to play there, although I think we need to build that skill set within the Permanent Defence Force too.<\/p><p>The Reserve is not where it needs to be.  It needs to increase in size by not quite but nearly threefold.  I hope by the end of the year we will have a revitalisation plan, if you like, for our Reserve in terms of resourcing, training and how it fits into the new defence headquarters------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#E00500","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Into the overall structure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#F00200","speaker":"1495"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":837,"content":"<p>-----which is recommended.

I join colleagues in commending our troops abroad.  I have been out there a few times and the reaction in Lebanon, in particular, from the civilian population is very positive to our troops in the way they interact and the informal friendly and professional way they very often go about their business.  Our troops are recognised globally for being extremely professional in peacekeeping operations.  I want to put that on the record.<\/p> <p>  Moving on to what Deputy Clarke mentioned a while ago, I see more and more articles and studies with headlines that say democracy globally is in retreat. That links with to what she has been saying with respect to conflict and climate change and what the Minister himself said with respect to the increase in files in the United Nations at the moment across the globe, which went from 13 a number of years ago to 30 now and is growing.  That is something about which I think we have to be concerned.  Freedom and democracy are also in retreat in many parts of the world.  We cannot be complacent about that.  We have a role to play there in preserving freedoms and democracy as we know it.<\/p> <p>  On the Reserve, again, part of the issue the Minister mentioned was the fact of getting troops in more than once and so on.  We know what the issues are.  Where are we with the Reserve going overseas?  How soon and how many?  What is being done to secure their civilian jobs at home while they are actually abroad?  Those are some specific questions.<\/p> <p>  I have already gone on the record more than once to question the recruitment process in the Defence Forces and the fact that 60% of people who want to join, or rather who apply to join, fail the aptitude test.  I mentioned that recently in the D&aacute;il as well and maybe it is something that can be looked at.  That figure seems to me to be very high.  Deputy Berry might have more to say on that in a minute seeing as he has experience of it.  It seems to be quite high, however.  If youngsters want to join and they are faced with this, is there something wrong here?  Are we missing something?  I do not know.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned cybersecurity.  Will he comment on the security of our mobile telephone systems?  Earlier this year, the Minister told us his own telephone was hacked.  How secure are our mobile telephone systems?  Everything is on these things now.  We saw some reports in the newspapers last week about the Pegasus software that has been developed in some other countries and is being used to quite devastating impact and effect.  People tell me one does not even know it is on one's telephone.  The Chairman's telephone could be hacked and he would not even know it.  The Minister's telephone could be as well.  A person's physical location can be monitored and tracked or who he or she is with or speaks to and what emails he or she sends can be monitored and so on.  Deputy Brady's telephone could be the same - who knows?  None of us knows.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#F00800","speaker":"1515"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":843,"content":"<p>I am conscious that Pegasus is Israeli technology.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#F00900","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":844,"content":"<p>It seems many other countries also have this now and other technologies.

I agree with him.  I am not sure global democracy is in retreat but it certainly needs to push back to protect its existence.  There are certainly parts of the world where it is under attack.  That goes for human rights standards, respect for international law and a range of other things.<\/p> <p>  Our commitment to multilateralism is absolute when it comes to foreign policy.  Small countries cannot survive if they rely on unilateralism and transaction-based foreign policy, where countries pair off with each other on the basis of supporting each other on important things.  That is a disaster for small countries.  What we need is a world set of rules protected by international law, global standards from a human rights perspective, and conventions that countries respect, even in conflict situations, as opposed to a might is right, brutality rules type approach, of which, unfortunately, we have seen a number of examples, not just in Ukraine but elsewhere.  That is a given and I think it is something on which we can all agree.<\/p> <p>  The UN is central to Irish foreign policy.  It is far from perfect.  It is incredibly frustrating at times when the Security Council sees sensible resolutions that have the support of well over 100 countries in the General Assembly get vetoed.  When Ireland, for example, tried to get a resolution on climate and security agreed, it was vetoed by Russia.  We had 119 co-sponsors from the General Assembly who wanted that resolution passed.  An overwhelming majority recognised the impact of climate on security issues and it got vetoed.  It is very frustrating stuff.  Despite all of that, however, it is by far the best we have in terms of trying to assist and help people.<\/p> <p>  If we think about it, and I will stop giving members statistics after this, 100 million people are displaced in the world today.  Most of them are in refugee camps and virtually all of them are being fed by international organisations, predominantly led by the UN.  I have just been to the Syrian-Turkish border where Ireland has specific responsibility, along with Norway, to keep humanitarian access into north-western Syria.  It is the only international border crossing into Syria.  It is called Bab al-Hawa.  That is literally feeding, clothing and providing medicines for four million people, which is almost our population.  If you cross the border there, there is effectively a tented city for as far as the eye can see made up predominantly of children, only 20% of whom actually get any form of education at all.  This is the scale we are talking about in terms of the consequences of a 12- or 13-year conflict in Syria.  Most people living in that area in north-west Syria in the Idlib province have not only been displaced once, twice or three times but some of them have been ten to 15 times in terms of being moved on from different towns that have been attacked and brutalised and so on.  I just want to give members a sense of the pressures to which the UN system is responding in keeping people alive but also the other frustrations that the system has not been able to get over.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the Reserve overseas, a reservist has actually gone on a NATO training course in the past couple of weeks, which I am sure Deputy Berry will remind me of, and which I think is a sign of things to come, not in terms of NATO membership but in terms of reservists going overseas and improving their skill sets so they can be a stronger asset in supporting the Permanent Defence Force.  We do not have reservists going overseas on rotation yet.  That is something on which I will be relying on the Chief of Staff and the general staff to come back with recommendations in terms of how they incorporate that, particularly around specialist areas.  This is not about competing with the Permanent Defence Force or taking opportunities from it.  It is quite the opposite.  It is about supplementing what it is doing, adding specialties and potentially giving options in terms of earlier rotation for family reasons, flexibility, work-life balance and all the other things.  If people need a break for whatever reason, reservists should be able to fill in there.  There is great interest within the Reserve in serving overseas.  I met the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, about that the week before last.<\/p><p> As for the aptitude test, there is a myth out there that no one is applying to join the Defence Forces.  Loads of people are applying to join the Defence Forces, but that is not translating into increased numbers to the extent we need.  Roughly, we are seeing between 500 and 600 people join the Defence Forces and between 500 and 600 people leave the Defence Forces every year.  We have seen either a small decline or a small increase in net terms over recent years, and that is not good enough.  What we need to see, if we are to be serious about getting to the numbers we plan to get to, are significant net increases of people in the Defence Forces each year to get back up to an establishment of 9,500 and then to go well beyond that in order to get to what I would like to see, which is a Permanent Defence Force establishment of about 11,500 and close to another 3,000 people in the Reserve.  We are 1,000 people below the establishment figure of 9,500 in the Permanent Defence Force, so we need to add about 3,000 people to the Permanent Defence Force and about 3,000 people to our Reserve.  That is 6,000 new men and women in our Defence Forces.  The questions are how we do it, how long it will take, how we manage the training in that regard, how we manage the intake, how we keep standards while getting more people in and how we maintain the thresholds needed to ensure we have the standards we have currently in respect of fitness, aptitude, skill sets and so on.  Those are massive challenges, but those are the questions the commission has asked and that is the challenge it has put to us.<\/p><p> From my experience of the Defence Forces, when a clear challenge is put to them, with clear results required and timelines to get us there, they are very good at delivering once there is a plan to do that.  It is seen as a mission to be accomplished.  My job is to make sure that they have the resources and the policy platform to be able to do that and that they have the expertise.  Some of it will need to be sourced externally to deliver those kinds of extraordinary outcomes over the next five to seven years, which is the time horizon I think we will be looking at.  Part of that is the aptitude test stuff, but I have to rely on the Defence Forces to come back to me with recommendations.  I will not lower the standards of the Defence Forces to get more people in, but there are valid questions.  Rather than simply having a cut-off point, whereby people are told they are not good enough, can we involve training mechanisms that can improve resilience, fitness and so on to allow people to get as good as they need to be to be in the Defence Forces, as opposed to eliminating them on one test or a series of beep tests?  Those are the kinds of things we are considering and talking to the Defence Forces about.<\/p><p> I will not say very much about cybersecurity because some of it involves national security issues and so on.  I need to be a bit careful.  Suffice to say we will invest heavily to increase cybersecurity capacity in the Defence Forces, as I said earlier.  That is more than justified and is very much supported by the commission's work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#F01100","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":847,"content":"<p>You stated, Minister, that you expect to have a Government decision on the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces before the end of this term, that is, before we rise for the summer.

I need to find agreement with multiple other Departments, particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach, in order to get final agreement on the report.  I think we are almost there.  There has been an awful lot of work on this.  We are not just signing off on a memo here; we are also signing off on an action plan.  There are 69 different actions asked of us in the report.  If the sub-actions are added, there are 130 or so.  We will itemise all of those and then give an indication as to how or if we will progress them all, whether we agree with them in principle but more work is required, whether we can progress them straight away, whether more advice is required in order to progress them and so on.  There has been an enormous amount of work.  I pay tribute to my Department and to the Chief of Staff and his team in the Defence Forces because, certainly in my time in politics, I have never seen such a level of co-operation on the civil and military side with regard to bringing forward something with the same level of ambition coming from both the Department and the Defence Forces.  I have never seen that as strong as it is now.  My job is to get the rest of the Government on board.  I think there is an appetite in the Government that recognises that the commission report is a really good piece of work.  Many of the Ministers to whom I have spoken have taken the time to read it, and it is quite a big piece of work.  I think we will get it past the Government.

I acknowledge the presence of the Defence Force veterans and their spouses in the Public Gallery.  Many of the contributors pointed quite rightly to the excellent reputation of Irish peacekeepers overseas.  That is because of the people sitting behind me, so well done to them.  They are most welcome here any time at all.<\/p> <p>  I have four brief points to make.  I know that the triple lock is not the entire focus of the motion before us, but many researchers read the transcripts of committee meetings so it is important to put on record that the three locks of the triple lock are Government decision, Oireachtas approval and UN mandate.  I recognise the views of Deputy Brady and the Minister, and both sides of the argument are completely sincerely held.  I am not too comfortable with the fact that Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping - or even Boris Johnson, in light of recent events - gets to decide where we send our troops.  I think there is a bit of flexibility on the second lock, which is Oireachtas approval.  At the moment Oireachtas approval is by simple majority, so a simple majority in the D&aacute;il unlocks the second lock.  I think we can move towards a qualified majority of 55% or 60% or something like that, which would allow the Oireachtas to maintain the autonomy and the sovereignty of deploying our troops without compromising the safeguards built into the triple lock.  Instead of a UN mandate being mandatory, we could have regard to a UN mandate.  Obviously, a UN mandate would be preferable, and whether it exists or does not exist would sway the vote of a qualified majority in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  That is probably a good way to go.  I offer that freely, and the researchers or party researchers can deal with it as they see fit.<\/p> <p>  My first question is about Ukraine.  We know that conflicts do not last for ever, but this one will go on for quite some time.  Is there any planning from a post-conflict point of view?  There is a lot of expertise in the Defence Forces in demining, demolition of explosive ordnance and even investigation of war crimes and reconstruction.  Does the military have any spare capacity or contingency planning done in case a request comes in?  Do we have capacity to assist the international community from a reconstruction point of view?<\/p> <p>  My second question is about strategic airlift.  I know I have been hounding the Minister on this for the past few years.  He mentioned we have troops scattered all over the world.  My concern is that we do not have any means to get to them in the event of a crisis.  I know that is a concern of the Minister's as well.  The memo to come to the Government, if it comes on Tuesday week, as he suggests, is a golden opportunity to grasp this nettle and to make a recommendation that we need at least one aircraft that will be able to reach our people overseas if they get into trouble.<\/p><p>We have never had that capability in the past, particularly in the past 100 years.  It would be a great capability to have and we should be focused on that.<\/p><p> My final question relates to the Reserve Defence Force overseas.  I am glad both sides brought it up.  I am very much in favour of it and welcome the recent course overseas for the Reserve Defence Force.  The Minister may or may not be aware that a proposal is going around to the effect that Reserve Defence Force personnel can only be activated for a maximum of a 90-day period.  To me, that is completely unworkable.  A person going overseas, even as a member of the Permanent Defence Force regulars, will spend six weeks in preparatory training before deploying.  If there is a 90-day cap on Reserve Defence Force personnel heading overseas, they will only be able to form up for six weeks and deploy for six weeks.  These people are either in the military or they are not.  They are either members of the Defence Forces or they are not.  If a full tour of duty is six months, I do not see why a cap should apply.  There is no cap on the Permanent Defence Force, for instance, and I do not understand they there should be one on the Reserve Defence Force.  <\/p><p> Those are my views.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts on the triple lock, strategic airlift, Ukraine and the Reserve Defence Force.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#G00400","speaker":"1587","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":851,"content":"<p>I am conscious that the committee had an engagement on the triple lock and heard the views of the Minister.

I would happily do that in the early autumn when we return after the summer recess.  There are ways in which we can provide a lock system of sorts but at the same time not hand a veto to a government or country that we do not regard as consistent with our value system.  That is what we have at the moment.  It has not been a problem to date, in reality.  It could potentially have been a problem theoretically but it has not been, which is why there has not been a big focus on it.  I think it did perform a useful political purpose in giving reassurance around the neutrality question in the sense that everything we did required a UN mandate, which made many people comfortable.  The truth is that UN mandates can now be vetoed by countries whose motivation and priorities we do not share.  If we are to be a serious country in terms of peacekeeping and peace interventions, and if we want to be able to make decisions for ourselves as a country that is non-aligned militarily, then we need to be able to make decisions by ourselves with the right motivation.  I think we can do things to add to that and to give the reassurance that some Deputies will look for in terms of consistency with international law and the invitation of the country concerned.  We can look for consistency with various UN resolutions or whatever else.  There are options at which we can look.  If it would be helpful to the committee, I could bring in some options at which we could look and discuss.  I would like to get agreement on this with other political parties rather than have the Government force it through.  These are important issues and I would like as many as people in the Oireachtas as possible to be comfortable with them, as opposed to it becoming a debate around something it is not.  We may well have to have a debate in the future around neutrality, if that is justified, but I am not proposing to have that debate in the context of how and where we send our troops.  The triple lock is a separate issue.  It is potentially a problem because of the way in which global politics has changed in the past five or six months.  I do not believe we should be operating in a straitjacket on the basis of relying on certain countries not vetoing decisions we would like to make.<\/p> <p>  We can consider some of the suggestions made by Deputy Berry but there is no tradition of qualified majority voting, QMV, in the Oireachtas, as far as I am aware.

That request related specifically to the area of demining.  Having been to Ukraine since the war began, I am aware there are mines all over that country, including in houses, schools, public buildings and fields.  Even before this war ends, for the parts of Ukraine that are not impacted by the war, there will be a need for some demining operations and so on.  They need help, they have asked for it and we are going to try to respond positively to that request.<\/p> <p>  There has also been a request for engineering assistance around the rebuilding of buildings that have been destroyed by cruise missiles and other munitions.  The reconstruction of Ukrainian cities will cost hundreds of billions of euro, which the EU will help to fund in the years ahead.  That will be less a military operation.  It will require expertise in engineering, construction and project management.  Ireland will be more than willing to assist in that regard.<\/p> <p>  We are considering the issue of strategic lift capacity.  The development of a strategic airlift capacity for the Air Corps, although desirable and at a pre-planning stage, requires an informed approach and full consideration.  That is a very general answer.  We are considering what kind of lift capacity we are looking at.  Are we looking at medium-range capacity?  If we are doing that, what size aircraft are we looking at?  Are we looking at taking out small numbers of people in situations where we need to get people out quickly?  Are we talking about moving large troop contingents?<\/p><p>They are two very different prospects with a very different cost.  Those things are being examined and I will be happy to let the Deputy know when we have made some decisions on them in terms of investments and so forth.  However, we are certainly looking at medium-range capacity, which I believe is necessary and has been raised as well by the commission report.<\/p><p> Regarding the Reserve, I hope we gave the RDFRA some reassurance on this issue.  What we have said is there is a figure of 90 days but that it is certainly not cast in stone and can be increased.  It is quite straightforward to do that.  More importantly, we need to get agreement with employers.  The vast majority of reservists have a day job doing something else and I need to make sure people who sign up to be in the Reserve Defence Force and who volunteer to perform a mission or a function with the Permanent Defence Force do not find that their jobs are gone when they come back.  We have started the process of reaching out to IBEC and other employer groups to try to agree an understanding on how we can facilitate reservists contributing more to defence infrastructure without risking losing their jobs or missing out on promotion opportunities or whatever.  The best way to do that, rather than going straight to legislation where there could be a lot of resistance and so forth, is to try to get agreement on reasonable parameters that would allow reservists to take time off work to be part of missions at home or overseas, and they would get protections from their employers to do that.  I am also speaking to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's office on that because he is the one who potentially would have to put something in legislation that would firm that up.  We are in discussions on that issue at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#H01400","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":865,"content":"<p>Deputy Berry has a brief supplementary question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#J00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":866,"content":"<p>I wish to make a small point on that, and I am glad the Minister raised it.

Ireland has been a participant in PESCO since its establishment in 2017.  It is a process under which groups of member states can usefully come together to develop capabilities in support of Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, operations.  It represents a further development in EU co-operation in support of international peace and security under CSDP.  Participation is voluntary and, to date, 25 EU member states, including Ireland, have joined PESCO.  Following the recent decision to revoke its CSDP opt-out, Denmark is very likely to join PESCO projects very soon.  That would mean Malta is the only country that is not involved.<\/p><p>The objective of PESCO is to enhance the EU&rsquo;s defence capabilities for national and multinational missions and operations, to build on the EU&rsquo;s capacity for international security. and to assist in the protection of EU citizens while maximising defence spending by participating member states.  Participation in PESCO will enhance the Defence Forces&rsquo; military capabilities for participation in UN-mandated peace support operations, enhance interoperability and, working with our EU partners, ensure our troops are equipped with the latest and best equipment and training.  Ireland currently has the lowest participation rate of the member states in PESCO.  Ireland is a participant in only one of the 60 agreed PESCO projects - upgrade of maritime surveillance - and is currently an observer on a further nine projects.  Four of these projects are the subject of this motion where I propose we move from observer status to participant status.  What we are discussing today is the proposal for Ireland becoming full participants in four PESCO projects, on which we currently have observer status.  In other words, we know what is going on but we now want to get involved properly in the projects.<\/p><p>This proposal follows a detailed analysis by the Defence Forces and my Department, reflecting on our experience as observers and assessing the added value of becoming full participants.  In each case, the conclusion of the analysis and reflection is that full participation would deliver significant benefits to our Defence Forces to support them in their roles and, in particular, their contribution to international crisis management operations and peacekeeping.  I will now provide a brief overview of the four projects.<\/p><p>The first is the cyber threats and incident response information sharing platform.  The main objective of this project is to strengthen EU member states&rsquo; cyber defence capabilities and response to cyber incidents by delivering a cyber threats and incident response information sharing platform alongside an endpoint detection and response solution, in other words, getting better at spotting cyber threats and cyber attacks before they happen and dealing with them when they happen.  Ireland, like other EU member states, has an increasing reliance on information and communications technology to support our military operations.  Cyber attacks represent a real and increasing threat to our Defence Forces operations, both at home and overseas.  The Defence Forces have assessed this project as being of particular value to them given that knowledge transfer relating to cyber threats is often the mitigation of actual attacks to networks.  Participation in this project will enhance their cyber capabilities and give them a further means to deal with both known and unknown cyber threats.  This is a Greek-led project and the other participating member states are Cyprus, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain.<\/p><p>The second is a deployable military disaster relief capability package.<\/p><p>The objective of this project is to develop a tool to support the EU&rsquo;s civil protection mechanism response efforts to natural and man-made disasters and humanitarian crises.  The tool will provide additional capabilities to the member states' response, resulting in enhanced capability and effectiveness of the overall response to emergencies.<\/p><p> The project has two pillars, which are training and operational.  The training pillar will establish a training centre for the conduct and delivery of disaster relief training.  The operational pillar will provide a deployable military disaster relief capability task force that could be activated at short notice following a request for assistance.  I acknowledge that any deployment of the Defence Forces would require a separate Government decision in accordance with the appropriate legislative requirements.  Italy will have the lead on this project and the other member state participants are Austria, Hungary, Greece and Spain.<\/p><p> The third project is a special operations forces, SOF, medical training centre.  The objective of this project is to establish a medical training centre that will focus on medical support for special operations.  SOF operations occur in high-threat environments without normal access to essential medical services.  This training centre will focus on medical education and certified training for medical and non-medical support in SOF operations.  This vital training will enhance our Defence Forces capabilities, skills and knowledge in the area of life support, in particular when soldiers are deployed overseas on peacekeeping missions.  The project is expected to provide increased access to formalised, structured and appropriate medical courses that are the recognised interoperable standard across the EU special operations communities.  Hungary will have the lead on this project and Poland is currently the other member state participant.<\/p><p> The fourth project is maritime, semi-autonomous, systems for mine countermeasures.  The objective of this project is to deliver semi-autonomous underwater, surface and aerial technologies and capabilities for maritime mine countermeasures.  This system will enhance maritime security by assisting to counter the threat from sea mines and other malign actors in the maritime domain.  It will provide Ireland with a flexible, modular, innovative technology, which will enable the Defence Forces to develop an increased level of protection to key national infrastructure, including harbours, critical offshore infrastructure and sea lines of communications.  Belgium is the lead on this project and the other participating member states are France, Greece, Latvia, Poland, Portugal, Romania and the Netherlands.  There is a lot of interest in that and I suspect there will be increased interest in the context of what is happening in the Black Sea at the moment.<\/p><p> The cost of Ireland&rsquo;s move to full participation in these projects should not extend beyond travel costs to attend workshops, meetings or participation in or delivery of training.  Any such costs can be met from within existing resources within my Department.  In the event of a decision to procure any equipment or capability arising from, or developed as part of, these projects would be progressed through the Department&rsquo;s normal procurement processes under the auspices of the joint high level planning and procurement group.<\/p><p> The enhancement and development of Defence Forces capabilities is essential when considering Ireland&rsquo;s continued participation in a full range of UN-mandated missions overseas and to respond to the challenges from a defence and security perspective at home.  Participation in these projects will further enhance the capability of our Defence Forces to undertake the roles assigned to them by the Government, both at home and overseas.  Our participation in PESCO involves no commitment to participate in any CSDP operation or to the development of any form of common military force.  Moreover, this is a modest proposal, which increases the number of projects in which we are full participants from one to five, out of a total of 60 agreed projects.  Most countries are involved in many more than Ireland already is and will be after this decision.<\/p><p> The Defence Forces and my Department will continue to assess the value of the other projects with a view to possible observer status, during which time a further assessment can be made of the possible added value of progressing to full participation.  Any proposal in that regard will only be done on the basis that there is demonstrable added value of full participation.  I commend the motion to the committee.  This has been a long explanation but hopefully it will assist the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#J01000","speaker":"1457","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":875,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

It is impossible to separate it away from the stated position and rhetoric from officials within the EU and European parties.  The Minister's party is a member of the European People's Party, which fully supports the creation of a European army.  It was only last month that Josep Borrell stated that the EU needs to develop military force to give it military strength.  It is impossible to look at PESCO without the broader policy that is at the core of thinking within the EU in certain quarters.  Federica Mogherini, who was the former representative for EU foreign affairs and security at the time PESCO was launched, said it was about building an EU defence union, one that would complement NATO's security aims.  Other EU officials insist that it is not just a bureaucratic co-operation but real investment that will help to develop the EU's defence industry and spur research and development in the military capabilities the bloc needs most.  On the face of what is being presented here with the particular scenarios put forward by the Minister, it is impossible to isolate it from the broader views within the EU around the development of an EU military.<\/p> <p>  As I have said, that is a policy position not just of the European People's Party but also of other groupings  within the EU.  It has been a long-held position of Fine Gael and of previous spokespersons about neutrality and the need to move on from it.  We are being told by the Government that the war in Ukraine has accelerated the need for a debate on neutrality.  I think back to the invasion of Iraq.  At the time, I believe it was Enda Kenny who used that particular war and invasion to question Ireland's neutrality and said it was time to have a discussion around neutrality.  The Fine Gael Party certainly seems to be happy to hitch its wagon to any international crisis that will help to accelerate its agenda around the abolition of Ireland's military neutrality.

Many would say it is a Trojan horse to develop an EU army.  It is impossible not to look at the further cosying up to NATO.

It is hard not to ask what the bigger picture is.<\/p><p> I will leave it at that.  The Minister might touch on some of those major concerns.

There is absolutely no move towards a European army or Irish support for one or any political party in Ireland looking to support one.  Could the Deputy stop trying to misinform people to make party political points?  We should be beyond that, given the seriousness of security debates at the moment in the European Union.  What I am trying to do as Minister for Defence, and what I have an obligation to do, is to ensure that our Defence Forces are trained to an international standard that we can stand over.  That standard, right across the EU for NATO members and non-NATO members, is the NATO standard.  The point is if we are training with, on peacekeeping missions with, or responding to an emergency with other countries in the EU with which we work all the time, we understand how to use similar equipment and have similar training skill sets, capacity and so on.  Just because we operate to NATO standards does not mean that we are on a stepping stone to NATO membership.  We have been operating on or trying to reach NATO standards for many years now.  To try to distort that into something that it is not, given the seriousness of defence right now is just irresponsible.  I am sorry if I am pushing back but that is the position.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy has chosen to introduce that element into this discussion unfortunately.  We are not talking about a European army here or a defence union either.  The Deputy can quote Josep Borrell if he wants or Federica Mogherini if he wants to.  Incidentally, Josep Borrell is not a member of the EPP.  Deputy Brady seems to be linking the two.  He is trying to ensure that the EU has the capacity to respond to crises if needs be and to ensure that countries in the EU which want to work together to build capacity in security and defence can do so.  What we are choosing to do here and what we are asking for support for is that Ireland would work with other countries to look at issues such as cyberthreats and to make sure that we have the best protections and infrastructure that we can put in place by learning from other countries and working with them to ensure that if we have to deploy, if Ireland wants to be part of deploying a response to a natural disaster somewhere - mass flooding, an earthquake or tsunami or a post-conflict situation - and if Ireland chooses to be part of a rapid response to that, that Ireland would have trained with other countries that will help us respond to save lives.  That, somehow, is supposed to be linked to the creation of a European army.  We want to try to double our Army Ranger wing in size over time because it is justified.  There is an idea that our special forces training with other countries, specifically in first aid and medical provision in complex, difficult, dangerous operations, is a bad thing because it is somehow linked to PESCO which, in some people's minds is really about the creation of a European army, when it is not.  The core issue is that these are all voluntary.  If we were being sucked into this, we would not be here debating it.  I am effectively asking for support and permission because I think, on the back of the recommendation from our Defence Forces, that our Defence Forces would benefit from these things in terms of being better equipped, better trained, safer in the field and it allowing us more flexibility in terms of collective partnerships.  Every time we send our Defence Forces abroad, we are partnering with another country.  We are not living in isolation here where we set our own standards militarily and ignore everything going on around us.  Every time we send a rotation out to UNIFIL, UNDOF, to Mali or other parts of the world, it is with other countries with which we need to be interoperable.  That is predominantly how I see PESCO.  It is true that some other countries will describe and see PESCO differently.  They will choose to be part of other PESCO projects that we will not choose to be part of to build capacity in other areas.  I accept that point.  But the whole point of PESCO is that it is designed to accommodate countries like Ireland, Cyprus, Austria and Sweden and Finland, the latter two of which were not members of NATO until now and would not have been were it not for Russian aggression.  Looking at those countries, Austria, Finland, Cyprus and Sweden, they are all involved in between five and ten PESCO projects.  They are all militarily non-aligned too, or at least they have been until recently.  I want to reassure people listening that this is not undermining Irish neutrality or a journey to some kind of European army.  It is about capacity and voluntarily responding to training and capacity improvement opportunities that other countries are buying into as well.  In all of these, we have chosen to be an observer first, so we are cautious because of some of the issues the Deputy raised and the perceptions around it.  In all these, we choose to be an observer first and the military advice to me is that we should move now from observer status into full participation because we will benefit from that.  And we can choose to leave whenever we want if we decide that it is no longer appropriate for us.  That does not sound like what the Deputy described in terms of the origins of PESCO.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#L00700","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":889,"content":"<p>For the record, on names of people outside the House being mentioned, the Minister has clarified the relationship between our party and Mr. Josep Borrell, that is there is none.

First, the military is very much in favour of them because the skill set will empower them but also personally.  In the last 20 years I have benefited enormously from international training in my former line of work.  I did multiple courses with the UK Armed Forces.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#L01300","speaker":"1587"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656543600,"counter":895,"content":"<p>This was a three month course on live fire.  All of the skills I picked up there, I brought back into the Irish Defence Forces.  We have never had a single live fire fatality in the Defence Forces as a result because of the excellent skills we are picking up abroad, bringing back and ploughing into our own organisation here.<\/p><p>I have done multiple medical courses to make me a better doctor and multiple courses in hostage rescue which made me a better operator as well.  I totally see the value of these courses, workshops and this international training and it protects Ireland more than anything else.  It gives us the skills because we do not have the expertise on the island at the moment.  Because of our history, thankfully, we have not been involved in major conflicts.  Other countries have and have learned many hard lessons.  We have the opportunity to pick up these lessons and not to repeat the mistakes that they made.<\/p><p>On the four projects being selected, I believe they have been very carefully chosen, which I acknowledge.  The first of these is on cybersecurity and we know what happened in the HSE last year.  It could happen again next year and even tonight with our national grid or our transport infrastructure.  We need to have the expertise to be able to protect ourselves.  That is all about getting information and bringing it back.<\/p><p>Second, from a special forces and medical point of view, I would be concerned about the medical backup for the Defence Forces at the moment.  We have been very fortunate that we have not experienced any major casualties overseas so we have not been tested.  This is an opportunity where, for example, if there is a hostage situation in Dublin airport if an aircraft is hijacked, and if the Army Ranger Wing has to go in and take that aircraft down, that it knows it has the edge on the terrorists and that it has the best medical backup in equipment, knowledge and expertise that it needs.<\/p><p>The disaster relief project is of great importance for our Engineer Corps and for Ireland also.  We know climate change is coming down the tracks and that flood relief is going to be a big issue.  It is very important that our Engineer Corps has the expertise and the equipment on site and available to intervene and look after the public as best as possible in disaster relief, without even mentioning overseas service.<\/p><p>Finally, from a mine clearance point of view, this is very topical in the Black Sea at the moment where there are 20 million tonnes of grain and there are serious discussions going on as to whether there should be an international coalition of the willing to go in with escort vessels to bring merchant vessels out with the grain on board.  The Naval Service has almost no expertise in mine clearance and it is very important that it does, particularly in respect of undersea cables etc.<\/p><p>The military are completely in favour of it and I am completely in favour of the projects that have been selected.  It is very prudent to move from observer to participant status.<\/p><p>To sum up, politically, we engage beyond this island and diplomatically we engage with our peers abroad, which is even the case from a scientific point of view.  It is completely appropriate that our armed forces are able to engage and learn the lessons from abroad and bring them back to this island to make us a better group.  There is a phrase going around where the accountant says to the CEO what if we train all of these people and they just leave.  The CEO then says what if we do not train them and they stay.  That is the situation which the Defence Forces are in at the moment which is that we do not have access to this expertise.  We have to go abroad to learn the expertise, bring it back and make our military the best it can possibly be so that in the event of us having to operate independently to protect our own island, we have the capacity to do so.  I am totally in favour of these four projects and I look forward to supporting them.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":896,"content":"<p>That was more of a statement than it was questions for the Minister but I invite the Minister to make a brief response and then I will call Deputy Brady.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#M00200","speaker":"1589"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":897,"content":"<p>I am glad that Deputy Berry has been as positive about these projects as he has because I have a great deal of respect for his own experience within the Defence Forces and indeed within the Army Ranger Wing, which is part of this package.  We need to see partnership as a positive thing when it comes to defence not as a risk to our independence, our sovereignty or our neutrality.  There are, of course, parameters to that and I completely accept that but it is the norm for European countries to train and compete together.  Our Army Ranger Wing tends to do very well in international competitions with special forces from other countries, including some NATO countries in respect of the standards it sets.  We need to maintain that and ensure that the equipment we are using, our capacity and skill set can then be turned into a partnership when called upon to make an intervention.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Brady referred to Josep Borrel talking about the need for defence capacity, which he did.  One of the things in the Strategic Compass for Security and Defence - which is what all of the EU countries have agreed and is the policy template for taking forward common security and defence issues across the EU for the next decade - is that there would be a rapid response capacity.  That is, that the EU could respond if there was a massive tragedy in north Africa that needed an EU response because it is in our neighbourhood where, if we needed to make an intervention to save people in the case of a natural disaster, a post-conflict situation, or whatever, that we would have the actual capacity to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#M00300","speaker":"1457"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":898,"content":"<p>I was referring to Josep Borrell speaking on the development of military strength not humanitarian assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2022063000002#M00400","speaker":"1625"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":899,"content":"<p>If I may make the point, please, Mr. Borrell is talking about a 5,000 strong force to respond, should they be needed, to make an intervention.  Even in those kinds of interventions, Ireland has never been forced to respond to them.  We will decide and that is our position, if we will be involved or if we will not.  If we have not trained with other countries, however, or are not interoperable with them, we will then not have the choice to go even if we want to.  We will not be wanted because we will not be able to operate properly in partnership with others.<\/p> <p>  We will commit, for example, from 2025 onwards to be part of a joint training project which is called a battle group in Germany.  We have done that before in Finland and in Germany.  Again this is about interoperability and it has in fact never been called upon.  It is an unfortunate name because it is actually about a peace intervention, in real terms.  This is about training, capacity and ensuring that our skill set is where it needs to be to keep our people safe and to be able to make interventions should they be needed and should we make the political decision ourselves to make those interventions.<\/p> <p>  Since we made the decision in principle on the mine clearance issue, the war in Ukraine has obviously evolved and we can see now the practicalities around some of these training mechanisms.  If we were called upon to be part of helping to get millions of tonnes of grain out of Odessa, or ports around that city, one would like to be in the position to have at least the option to respond in the affirmative.

However, my first question for the Minister is why now.  We should be dealing with all of these issues for our Defence Forces from the perspective of the Commission on the Defence Forces report.

In the Minister's statement, the fourth paragraph talks about the triple-lock system that is in place in respect of UN-mandated missions, where the Minister had previously said that he would like to see this amended.  Does that also apply to what the Minister has outlined in this report because it goes on to speak of: &ldquo;any deployment of the Defence Forces would require a separate Government decision&rdquo;?<\/p><p>What is that?  How is it triggered?  How is it activated?  What does it look like?<\/p><p> My final question is in relation to the cybersecurity aspect of this.  We spoke of the National Cyber Security Centre earlier.

We need to have that debate in the months ahead, which I think the Taoiseach has also suggested we do.  The answer to that for me is more partnership, more willingness to work and train with other countries so we are interoperable should we need to be and more investment in our Defence Forces so we can increase our own capacity rather than having a reliance on others with core defence issues.  What we need is less isolation and more partnership.  Do I believe we need to join a formal defence alliance?  No, I am not proposing that.

However, while we are talking about having a national conversation, we see what is happening in other countries such as Finland and Sweden, for example.

In practice, this means that equality budgeting attempts to provide greater information on how proposed or ongoing budgetary decisions impact particular groups in society, thereby integrating equality concerns into the budgetary process.  Beginning with a pilot programme for the 2018 budgetary cycle, due to the availability of disaggregated data, the initial focus of equality budgeting was on gender, following which the initiative was broadened to other dimensions of equality, such as socioeconomic inequality, disability and minority groups.  Integrated within the performance budgeting framework, equality objectives and indicators are published every year in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, and the public service performance report.  Six Departments were involved in the pilot and, following periodic expansion of this policy, all 18 Departments are now participating in equality budgeting.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is committed to working with other Departments, agencies, experts and advocacy groups to advance the equality budgeting initiative to best international standards.  In 2018, an expert advisory group was established to guide development of this work.  The role and objectives of the expert group are to give constructive critical feedback and to provide expert guidance and informed insight on the future direction and areas of focus for equality budgeting.  Members of the group include key Departments, the CSO, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, the National Disability Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.<\/p> <p>  In 2019, the OECD was requested to conduct a review of the equality budgeting pilot and give recommendations on how this work could be progressed in line with international best practice.  The report, published in 2019, provided 12 recommendations on how to drive this initiative forward.  Implementation of the report's recommendations is now at an advanced stage.  In order to assess the availability of disaggregated data, the CSO appointed a statistician to conduct a data audit in 2020.  The results of the data audit, which are available on the CSO website, provide a central point of information and highlight where data gaps exist.  Overseen by the CSO and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, a data strategy is currently being drafted to address this and identify measures that can enhance the data captured.  Another OECD recommendation was the development of a tagging and tracking functionality for departmental expenditure.  An EU-funded project to develop this capability is currently under way, with officials from the OECD in Dublin this week to meet pilot Departments.<\/p> <p>  To accelerate the implementation of equality budgeting, in 2021 the Government agreed to the establishment of an interdepartmental group for equality budgeting to facilitate the embedding of the initiative across all Departments.  Members are accountable for ensuring that policymakers in their Departments are fully aware of, and implementing, equality budgeting policy, where applicable, and bringing all relevant work within their Departments to the attention of the performance budgeting unit to ensure that the strategic direction of equality budgeting is fully informed.  This group will play a key role in guiding the continued progress of equality budgeting.<\/p> <p>  An ambitious work plan for equality budgeting policy is in place for the coming year, which aims to continue the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.  All Departments have been requested to conduct a skills and needs analysis to inform this work.  Some Departments reported on this at the last interdepartmental group meeting in February, with remaining Departments due to report at the next meeting, which will be held later today.  The equality budgeting framework is kept under constant review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability on public expenditure impact.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and we look forward to receiving feedback from this committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022063000002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline O'Loughlin"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":986,"content":"<p>I thank Ms O'Loughlin.

The Central Statistics Office is Ireland&rsquo;s national statistical institute and is responsible for the production, co-ordination and qualitative oversight of official statistics for Ireland.  The CSO is an independent office of the Civil Service under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  The National Statistics Board, with the agreement of the Taoiseach, has the general function of guiding the overall strategic direction of the CSO under the Statistics Act 1993.  This independent position reflects international best practice for the organisation of official statistics.  The role of the director general of the CSO, as prescribed by the Statistics Act 1993, provides that the officeholder acts independently and exercises sole responsibility in professional statistical matters.  Under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, the director general may request any public authority to consult and co-operate with him for the purpose of assessing the potential of records as a source of statistical information.  In addition, the Act stipulates that a public authority shall consult with the director general, where it intends to introduce, revise or extend the retrieval of information or make a statistical survey.<\/p> <p>  Statistics on equality and anti-discrimination topics are highly relevant from a fundamental rights perspective.  In order to meet national user needs in this area, the CSO uses data from administrative sources and statistical surveys to compile a range of outputs disaggregated by the equality-related characteristics.  All results are disseminated in a highly accessible manner through a range of channels and are often accompanied by infographics, press releases, statistical releases and explanatory material.  The CSO sits on several interdepartmental groups related to equality, including gender equality.  We work closely with the expert advisory group on equality budgeting, have completed and published an equality data audit of the Irish public sector in 2020 and are currently developing a national equality data strategy with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The CSO is also working with the 30% Club public sector network.  The goal of this network is that of improving gender balance across the public service population as an entirety, joining other areas of the Irish business community and the global community.<\/p> <p>  The recent 2022 census of population included questions on age, sex, disability, ethnicity, religion, country of birth and citizenship, general health and carers.  The detailed census results, which will be published during 2023, will be disaggregated by these key characteristics at a detailed geographic level.  Ireland is one of the few EU countries to collect data on ethnicity, religion and carers in its census of population.  The CSO is planning to begin the consultation with the general public and data users later this year on questions for census 2027.  The CSO expects that submissions will be received requesting the inclusion of new questions on gender identity and sexual orientation as part of this consultation.  The successful development of questions on these topics as part of the CSO's household surveys in recent years should enhance the prospects for both topics to be included in the next census.<\/p> <p>  The recent census contained questions on regular unpaid personal help or support to family members, neighbours or friends with a long-term illness, health issues or issues relating to age or disability, and the extent of the help provided.  A thematic report, Health, Disability and Carers, similar to that published from the 2016 census, will be published in 2023.  This will provide detailed data and analysis on those with a disability, while also examining changes in relation to carers, looking at issues such as the age and gender profile of carers, the number of carers in each county, and the hours of care provided.<\/p> <p>  The CSO also conducts a number of household surveys to meet national and international user needs, including, but not limited to, the labour force survey, the survey on income and living conditions, and CSO pulse surveys.  These surveys all contain a selection of core demographic variables, including age, sex and education.  All results from these surveys, covering themes such as employment, poverty, health, household wealth etc., are disaggregated by sex and the other core demographic variables.<\/p><p> The CSO publishes policy-relevant research projects as part of its leadership role of the Irish statistical system.  These include research projects related to many topics including gender equality, such as the employment analysis of maternity and paternity benefits.  The 12th edition of the CSO's thematic social indicator report on gender, women and men in Ireland will be published in 2023.<\/p><p> The CSO also carries out an equality and discrimination survey on a five-yearly basis.  This survey is designed to measure discrimination experienced in the previous two years.  The survey collects data on ten grounds of discrimination, including gender.  It covers workplace discrimination and discrimination experienced in accessing services.  The CSO is undertaking a comprehensive national survey on the prevalence of sexual violence in Ireland.  The safety of the person survey is a challenging survey operation involving the collection of highly sensitive personal data in a manner which is confidential, ethical and designed to support accurate and reliable survey results.  The CSO has undertaken significant work in collaboration with the Department of Justice, NGOs, international experts and other stakeholders in this domain.  The survey will establish the prevalence of sexual violence.<\/p><p> While a survey on sexual violence prevalence meets needs, a more broadly based survey on violence is also needed.  Proposals at EU level for a directive on gender-based violence are at an advanced stage.  Such a survey will cover sexual and non-sexual violence.  Again, the data, when the survey is run, will be capable of analysis by sex and gender.  It is expected that this survey will be first run in Ireland in 2024.  The surveys on sexual violence and gender-based violence will provide comprehensive data on such important societal issues for Ireland.<\/p><p> The CSO also produces statistics on gender balance in business in response to the Balance for Better Business initiative and aims to provide benchmark information on gender representation.  These statistics were compiled from surveys in 2019 and 2021 and provide benchmark statistics on gender representation at the most senior levels in large enterprises.  Analysis of weekly and annual earnings by sex is included in the Earnings Analysis Using Administrative Data Sources publication.  Results are available for 2011 through 2020.  Analysis of earnings by sex is presented across economic sector, firm size, region lived, age and nationality.  The official gender pay gap estimate for Ireland is compiled from the four-yearly structure of earnings survey, SES.  This survey collects detailed data on hours worked by employees that is not available from administrative data sources.  For non-SES years, an estimate of the gender pay gap is produced based on other available data sources.<\/p><p> New data sources that would improve our ability to provide more detailed and regular analysis of pay by gender are also being explored, notably the possibility of obtaining details of hours worked at an employee level from enterprises that are affected by the new gender pay gap reporting requirements.  The identification, exploration and increased use of data sources is a specific aim of the CSO in meeting the increasing appetite for timely, relevant information on a broad range of topics, including gender equality.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022063000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieran Culhane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":989,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Culhane for that overview.

As the Deputy said, data was one of our challenges.  As we started out on equality budgeting, we identified very early that the availability of disaggregated data needed to be addressed.  As I mentioned earlier, one of the first things we did was identify steps we could take to address that.  The CSO appointed a statistician for an initial six-month period.  She conducted a data audit of all the available data in Ireland.  Obviously, that helped us because we realised that we were not always aware and, for example, sometimes there was duplication.  We did not know what was out there, so it was great to have all of that information collected to a central point.  That told us what was available and what we could base metrics on.  It also told us where the gaps were and where we needed to address that.  As stated earlier, a data strategy is in train at the moment.  This is headed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the CSO.  They are looking at measures that we can take to plug those gaps and where we can capture the data.  The Deputy asked if the data are available.  We have some data and we are working on improving that.<br\/><br\/>All Departments are represented on the interdepartmental group.  We have terms of reference for which a representative from each of the Departments is accountable.  It is a two-way process.  The representatives bring our message back to the Departments and make sure that each is aware of equality budgeting and how it can implement it, and, then, <i>vice versa<\/i>, they make sure that we are aware of any relevant of work being done in line Departments that will inform will how equality budgeting is progressed.  The group has been in operation for less than a year.  As mentioned, each Department has carried out a skills and needs analysis.  Basically, this is an assessment of what they have that is suitable for equality budgeting and where they feel the barriers lie.  They brought the results back to us and we discussed what we can do to address matters.  As I said, half of the Departments did it at our previous meeting.  We have a meeting later on today with the interdepartmental group and the remaining Departments will give their skills and needs analysis then.  That will inform a work programme of how ensure, as the Deputy said, that it is being implemented and that Departments have realistic goals.  Every Department is participating in equality budgeting, as in they report on at least one equality metric in the REV or the performance report.  What we want to do in the short term is expand this in order that there is an equality budgeting metric for each programme of each Department.<br\/><br\/>What we have always said about equality budgeting is that is not a matter of clocking up metrics, ticking the box and saying that it is done.What we want equality budgeting to do is to be an example of how equality considerations can be properly implemented into performance budgeting as a whole.  We have seen that even though some Departments perhaps only report on two or three metrics, we can see how their general performance metrics have improved.  The focus has gone further to specific cohorts of society.  That is the approach we have taken with equality budgeting from the start.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy also mentioned international best practice.  In 2019, the OECD was asked to come over and do a scan of equality budgeting.  What we had done was still very much in its infancy at that time, but it came to look at what we had done and give us recommendations on how we could progress the work.  International best practice obviously played a key part in that.  Something I should also mention is that we are very active on the senior gender budgeting officials group of the OECD.  As far as I know, to date, Ireland is the only country that pursues equality budgeting.  All other OECD countries reported on a gender budgeting only basis.  However, it has to be said that the policies on gender budgeting are very transferable to all elements of equality and we have found that.  That is also why we work very closely with colleagues in green budgeting and sustainable development goal, SDG, budgeting.  International best practice has always been something that we have considered.<br\/><br\/>In the OECD recommended project dealing with tagging and tracking that the Deputy mentioned, we conducted technical assistance and information exchange visits, which are basically study visits, with other countries that do similar work.<\/p><p>It is a really beneficial network where officials from different countries will exchange experience such as what was good and what were the pitfalls to be avoided.  That has been beneficial to us.  We continue to participate strongly in the OECD senior budgeting gender equality officials network.

We found that coupled with some mandatory requirements where necessary, that is the approach to take to get these reforms to take root.

Our equality data audit that was not completed is a live document we did in 2020.  It is on the CSO website for researchers and policy makers to look at.  If there are other data sets we allow people to add to it and to tell us of other data sets that could be included and the breakdown of coverage of the dimensions on those data sets.  Ms O'Loughlin also mentioned our national equality data strategy.  We put together a working group with the CSO and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  That produced a document that put in place a strategic approach to improve the collection, use and dissemination of equality data across the public sector.

I have a range of questions following on from that exchange.  I thank the witnesses for coming in.  As Deputy Clarke said gender budgeting and data gathering sound quite dry and it is a technical exercise but of course the citizens' assembly was very clear as to its importance and as to the need to ensure proper and effective systems for equality budgeting in order to be able to drive the implementation of the other recommendations.  For example that lack of data on pensions for carers can have a real impact on gendered impacts on carers and so on.  The importance is clear.  I will go back to some of the recommendations from the citizens' assembly and try to tease those out with the witnesses.  Ms O'Loughlin and Mr. Hearne may respond to recommendation 42 on a statutory body for gender equality under the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister charged with cross-Government co-ordination of gender equality issues.  It is very welcome to hear about the high-level steps and measures that have been adopted within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and across all the Departments, and working with the CSO and stakeholders.  However, would a statutory body for gender equality and a specific Cabinet Minister responsible for this have an impact?  Would that improve the capacity to engage in equality budgeting?  I know the political decision is not something witnesses want to comment on but just to tease it out.  The citizens' assembly made that recommendation because it was concerned about clear lines of accountability and responsibility for delivering gender equality across Government.  Its recommendations on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence also recommended a specific Minister.  We have seen the Minister for Justice really taking on that role, which is very welcome.  There is now also a statutory body to be set up on that.  However, the citizens' assembly also recommended this for gender equality more generally.  How would that impact on the work currently being done on equality budgeting?  That is one question relating to recommendation 42.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation 43 is the critical one on data gathering.  There is a reference to care.  The citizens' assembly identified areas where it saw data as deficient, limited or out of date, or even contested.<\/p><p>Examples would be: domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; care; and gender pay gap measurement.  From the presentations from the Department and the CSO, clearly a good deal of work is underway on the area of violence.  The safety of the person survey is very welcome.  The gender pay gap legislation obviously has an impact on that data.  However, we are conscious that there are still deficiencies when it comes to care.  Coming back to Mr. Culhane's point, it may not be that the data is missing but that it has not been linked up, for example, those engaged in providing care and their pension entitlements, which is something the citizen's assembly honed in on.  How can we ensure improvements in gathering data on care in particular?<\/p><p> Regarding recommendation 44, the assembly recommended legislating for equality budgeting.  How could legislating help to ensure an effective system of equality budgeting?  I am looking at the OECD recommendation that if the practice was embedded in legislation, it would ensure that gender budgeting, in particular its objectives and insistence that accountability would be democratically proofed and insulated from economic and political changes.  The interdepartmental group was mentioned as a very welcome development in ensuring co-ordination but would legislation help in this regard?  There are quite a lot of issues there.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022063000002#F01100","speaker":"1698","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1006,"content":"<p>I might begin and then hand over to Ms O'Loughlin.  Regarding the Chairman's final question about whether legislation would be appropriate or would help in this regard, it is clear, from what we are doing that and from the wider work that is ongoing within the Department, that we have a very ambitious reform in respect of performance budgeting generally.  We have made some internal structural changes lately that bring equality budgeting, performance budgeting, green budgeting and all our initiatives on well-being budgeting into the same unit.  This will really help to avoid us having buzz words or particular modules that get a lot of focus over a period but that are not fully embedded.  Those changes will certainly will certainly help us.  That is an ambitious programme of reform.<\/p> <p>  On legislation, when we look at other OECD colleague countries and other comparators, we have comparatively few provisions for public financial management in law compared to what is generally out there.  We have legislation on how the Oireachtas appropriates budgets and how Voted expenditure and so forth is allocated but an awful lot of what we do, which is core practice in public financial management, is guided more by administrative arrangements and circulars.  If we look at things that are core around the public financial procedures and the public spending code on how we make decisions for capital expenditure, much of what we have been doing around performance budgeting has not typically had its roots in legislation.  For now, we are confident that the real thing is that we get the push from the bottom up, build out the community, have adequate expertise across the public sector and the Civil Service and set the requirements from the centre, for example, on the tagging project, which will be a really rich source of data on things like the improvement of the performance report and the equality modules within that.  Between those two and embedding it along the lines of the administrative procedure we use for most other aspects of public financial management, that will drive the change.  I will ask Ms O'Loughlin to come in regarding our work with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and the Department of Justice in the past.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's first question about recommendation 42, that is ultimately a policy question.  Our approach, as with all policy areas, is to make sure all our public financial frameworks, how we measure inputs, how we allocate resources, how we monitor performance and how we screen the impact of programmes are equally orientated towards equality and gender equality as they are to all the other fields of policy around our public capital programmes.  That will continue to be our focus - to work with the relevant policy Departments and make sure we are backing them up with adequate provision across public financial management.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GES2022063000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Hearne"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1007,"content":"<p>The Chairman asked whether a statutory body is needed.  Since equality budgeting was initiated, I do not think there has been a gap of expert guidance.  This originally came from the Department of Justice and Equality, as it would have been at the time.  We worked very closely with our colleagues in the equality division.  They had done a lot of work on gender and other dimensions such as minority groups.  It was very transferable to all the other dimensions of equality.  Almost within months of equality budgeting being piloted, we establish an expert advisory group.  We drew on the guidance of experts.  That group included groups like the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the ESRI and the National Economic and Social Council.

Although it is not perfect, with regard to equality budgeting, the Gini coefficient is one metric we could use to see how a given measure might impact inequality.  With regard to tax expenditure, efforts could be made to incorporate tax gap analysis.  That is already being done in some EU jurisdictions with regard to a range of taxes.  Tax gap analysis relates to the amount of tax revenues lost to taxpayer non-compliance and tax avoidance and the impact of Government tax policy choices.  Will Ms O'Loughlin comment on that?

However, we can influence that in that we provide guidance, as I have said.  The information comes back directly to the individual Vote sections first.

On behalf of the committee I give a very warm welcome to Mr. Jonathan Powell who is joining us remotely.  Mr. Powell was chief of staff to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair from 1997 to 2007 and was the chief British Government negotiator on Northern Ireland during that period.  Mr. Powell is very welcome.

The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, witnesses and participants who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts.  Such witnesses may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on that matter.  Witnesses are also asked to note that only evidence connected with the subject matter of proceedings should be given and should respect directions given by the Chair and the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.<\/p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am sorry that I cannot be there in person.  The Good Friday Agreement is something that I feel very strongly about.  I devoted a good part of my life to the process relating to it.  I have been involved in many negotiations in my life, but this particularly one was the most important for me and the one that I think has achieved the greatest benefit for all.<\/p> <p>  The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent St. Andrews Agreement have been remarkably successful in bringing a lasting peace to Northern Ireland.  They have not solved all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s problems from sectarianism to repeated political crises but they have so far prevented a return to the misery of the Troubles.<\/p> <p>  What the agreements did was to take the poison out of the issue of identity and allow us to return to normal politics where parties wrestled with the practical day-to-day problems like health and education.  We must remember that in the end the Good Friday Agreement was an agreement to disagree.  Unionists still wanted to remain in the UK and nationalists and republicans still wanted to be part of a united Ireland.  We did not solve that problem but both sides accepted the principle of consent if the status quo was to change, and that meant they could pursue their different aims politically, and purely politically and peacefully, rather than by violence.  It also meant that people in Northern Ireland could feel Irish, British or both.<\/p> <p>  This happy compromise has been upended by the impact of Brexit.  As was pointed out at the time of the referendum, the UK leaving the Single Market and customs union would require a border somewhere.  The Brexiteers pretended there was some magical answer where there could be a border through technology or some other means but if that were the case there would be no need for borders anywhere in the world.  It was never a credible solution to the problem.  The then Prime Minister, Theresa May, struggled, I think honourably, to try to find a solution with a Heath-Robinson type scheme involving the whole UK remaining in the customs union.  Boris Johnson instead opted for a border in the Irish Sea, something Theresa May had said no British PM could agree to.  This option is certainly massively better than a border on the island of Ireland, which would be disastrous for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process but we must recognise that it does raise issues for unionists about their identity.  It does put a border between them and the rest of the UK.  Unfortunately for the unionists, there are only these two choices.  In six years of trying, no one has been able to suggest an alternative.  Therefore, we will have work with the protocol and the border in the Irish Sea.<\/p> <p>  The current British Government has embarked on a policy of escalation by threatening to unilaterally abrogate the Northern Ireland protocol which they themselves negotiated and signed.  As a result, they have broken international law and undermined the UK&rsquo;s international reputation, alienated our allies in north America and Europe at a moment when we need them most and have potentially triggered a trade war when the world economy is struggling with a cost of living crisis.  The main casualty will be the Northern Ireland peace process itself.  That does not mean we are inevitably destined to return to the Troubles but rather that it creates a permanent political crisis where we cannot get the institutions up and running again and Northern Ireland is left without a viable Government for the foreseeable future.<\/p> <p>  The solution seems perfectly obvious.  The British Government should be negotiating and trying to de-dramatize the issue, rebuild trust with the EU and find solutions to the undoubted practical problems that exist as a result of the protocol.  This will require the EU to be flexible, and I think that they have been flexible, but they must be even more flexible around implementation.  It also requires the UK to drop ideological demands such as those around the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p>From my experience of negotiating in Northern Ireland and around the world, negotiations only work if there is trust between the two sides.  I fear what the current British Government has done is to destroy that trust.  That will make it very difficult indeed to get negotiations going again.  In fact, I find it hard to imagine how that will happen with the current Prime Minister in office.  I fear we may have to wait until he has departed before we have serious negotiations.  I hope I am wrong, because I do not want this political crisis to be prolonged.  That is my current view.<\/p><p> I will stop there.

I concur with Mr. Powell that the situation has never been as bad between Britain and Ireland.  One of the core elements of the Good Friday Agreement was the assembly, as well as North-South bodies which are not meeting.

Before I even go there, we could spend a day talking to him about what is going on with the Northern Ireland protocol.  He outlined the situation with the current British administration and the breakdown in relations.  We in Ireland find this to be an extraordinary time.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Powell was involved at a time when relations were at their strongest over the past 100 years.  It is pertinent that he brings that up, but I want to talk about the protocol.  Businesses in Northern Ireland are feeling the strain because trade on a North-South and east-west basis has never been better, and reality is that the Northern Ireland economy has never been better.  The fear is that there is an effort to pull Northern Ireland back in line with the UK economy because Northern Ireland is so successful.  It has become a good example of alignment with the EU.  If Northern Ireland is compared with the rest of the UK, it is a good example of one region that is doing well.  Look at the economy in areas controlled by those who caused Brexit.  It is a case of one versus the other.  The people in the North are very fearful that the British Government will damage the economy.  It is a worrying time.<\/p> <p>  As I said, the Good Friday Agreement was a fantastic achievement by everyone involved, including the UK and Irish Governments, all of the parties in Northern Ireland and the American Administration.  Many background meetings took place.  We need to acknowledge what it took to, for once in our lifetime, get people to come to the table, speak openly, honestly and with respect for each other and get an agreement done.  We need to remember the work involved in the lead in to the agreement and how long the negotiations went on for.<\/p> <p>   How did we get a UK Prime Minister who was so keen to work with an Irish Prime Minister?  The relationship between Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern was key.  How did that come about?  Tony Blair took a keen interest in the agreement and was very positive about trying to make it happen.  He worked closely with all involved.  Could Mr. Powell give us some background information on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#B00300","speaker":"1633"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>I again thank the committee for inviting me to speak.  The lead up to the Good Friday Agreement is a good place to start.  It is important to view it in a larger context.  It was not as if the Good Friday Agreement appeared from nowhere.  It was built on previous attempts at negotiation, in particular the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Although it, Sunningdale and, in the end, the Downing Street Declaration failed, the Good Friday Agreement built upon all three.  We see that in Colombia and elsewhere.  Agreements are not magicked out of thin air; they build on a series of attempts to get to peace.  The crucial point about the Good Friday Agreement negotiations was making them inclusive.<\/p> <p>  The negotiations succeeded where others had failed primarily because of the good relations between the Irish and British Governments and the way they worked together closely.  That was absolutely fundamental.  John Major worked very closely with his opposite number.  However, I remember being on the fringes of what was happening at the British embassy in Washington.  I knew the people doing the negotiations on the British side pretty well.  There was still a certain frisson of suspicion between the British and Irish Governments at that stage and slightly different interests.<\/p> <p>  One of the questions the Senator asked is why Tony Blair was interested in Northern Ireland at all.  There are precisely no votes relating to Northern Ireland in British politics.  One would not do it in order to win political success.  When he became leader of the Opposition in 1994, Tony Blair changed the policy of the Labour Party from being a persuader for unity into supporting John Major in his efforts to reach peace.  He felt that it was crucial for all of our islands, should be above politics and have an approach of bipartisanship.<\/p> <p>  Tony Blair supported John Major even when he thought some of the things John Major did were wrong.  He deliberately thought it was important for the two parties to stay together.  His interest came in part from his time spent as a child in Donegal with an Orange grandmother with whom he used to stay.  However, it was more than that.  It was about a commitment to making peace and he invested a great deal of his political capital in trying to make that peace.  The first visit he made out of London after being elected in 1997 was to Balmoral outside Belfast to make a speech to reassure unionists that the Labour Party was not a threat to them, but rather determined to try to get to an inclusive peace.<\/p> <p>  Tony Blair established a good relationship with Bertie Ahern from very early on.  The fact that both men were able to stay in office for so long was crucial.  In the history of Northern Ireland, British Prime Ministers came and went.  Tony Blair was someone who was determined to make a difference in Northern Ireland - he stayed in office for a long time - in partnership with his Irish opposite number.  It was crucial that Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern were prepared to take risks for peace.  They could have been criticised on both sides or things could have gone horribly wrong.  Even setting a deadline for the Good Friday Agreement by saying it would be done by Easter of the next year was a big risk.  Civil servants spent a lot of time trying to persuade Tony Blair to change his mind on that and not to crash it but rather extend the deadline.  He insisted on sticking to it.  The risk taking on both sides was crucially important.  Once Tony Blair got his teeth into trying to solve the Northern Ireland problem, he was very reluctant to give it up.  He is a very persistent person and he wanted to get to a solution.<\/p><p>In his autobiography Tony Blair says that I said that he solved Northern Ireland because he had a messiah complex.  In fact, it was not that.  It was Mo Mowlam, who had a very colourful turn of phrase, who told me that Tony Blair thought he was \"effing Jesus\", which is not quite the same thing as a messiah complex but is closely related.  He actually believed Northern Ireland could be resolved and he believed he could contribute to that.  That belief and commitment were crucial.<\/p><p> I have probably been a little long-winded and I apologise.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1077,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Powell.  Like the previous speakers, I compliment him on the work he did with Mr. Blair as his chief of staff and chief negotiator, on his commitment to the advancement of peace on this island and on his continued interest and the good and impartial commentary he gives through the media at different times.<\/p> <p>  As a person who worked at a senior official level with the British Government as a diplomat and then as Mr. Blair's chief of staff, his comments today on the foreign policy pursued by Mr. Johnson's Government are fairly stark, to say the least.  He used a few phrases that I totally agree with from my limited knowledge of British foreign policy.  He spoke about the unilateral action and how damaging it is.  He said the British Government is proposing to break international law, is undermining its country's international reputation and is alienating North American and European allies, with the possibility of potentially triggering a trade war.  He then outlined the difficulties that are created for the political institutions here as a result of the policies being pursued by that Government.  That is quite a stark message to an Irish parliamentary committee from a former senior diplomat and a person who worked at the highest level in politics in Britain.  I welcome his clear message and the clarity he delivers in that message.<\/p> <p>  It is worrying for us.  As has been said by my colleagues, relations between Ireland and Britain are now at a very low level.  For those of us who were in politics during that era, the one message that came across was the need for trust, and that is among the last words Mr. Powell used in his initial contribution.  There was obviously great trust between John Major and Albert Reynolds and subsequently between Mr. Blair and Bertie Ahern.  We listened to some of the Irish diplomats who were involved in negotiations at the time as well and the message I got was that one will not make progress unless there is trust between the Heads of Government.  I presume that permeates down to official level.  If there is no trust at political level between Heads of Government and the respective Ministers of the different Administrations, the official system will be poisoned as well in regard to the lack of trust between officials working on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Bearing that in mind, would Mr. Powell put great emphasis on the progress having been made because of trust between the Governments at the time at official level, political level and particularly at Heads of Government level?<\/p> <p>  By and large, the unionist parties have trusted successive Conservative governments.  With Mr. Powell's experience, does he think they will continue to have trust in Mr. Johnson since many of the commitments that have been made have not yet been honoured?  Today, sadly, this country and, indeed, our islands suffer because the political institutions that were established under the Good Friday Agreement, which were endorsed in referenda North and South, are not operational and fully functional on behalf of the people.  The will of the people is not being implemented in Northern Ireland due to the institutions not being in place.<\/p> <p>  Again, I sincerely Mr. Powell for his contribution in the past and for his ongoing commentary as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#C00200","speaker":"1556"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1078,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  He put his finger on the crucial issue, which is trust.  Just as we spent a decade building trust, the current Government is spending its time destroying trust, which is catastrophic.  I deeply regret the state of bilateral relations, which is terrible and totally unnecessary.  The only comfort I take is that I believe they can be restored very quickly.  It is <i>ad hominem<\/i>rather than about the countries concerned.  I believe any new British Government, whatever the party, would do its best to rebuild relations because they are so important and rebuild that trust.  I hope I am right in saying that.<br\/><br\/>Regarding trust and the Good Friday Agreement, it is the crucial point in a way.  It is true that John Major built a very good relationship with Albert Reynolds and there was a good deal of trust between senior officials on both sides.  However, as I said, there was still a little frisson.  I remember some British officials talking about how green Irish officials were and the like.  Interestingly, once it moved to the Blair Government, as Mr. Blair says and I think he is right, there was a new generation.  Both he and Bertie Ahern did not quite have the burden of history that someone from a previous generation, such as Mrs. Thatcher, would have had on Irish questions.  For them there was a much more open mind and they saw the need to get to peace, to get Northern Ireland politics working properly and to remove the poison of identity from it.  First, building that trust with Bertie Ahern was crucial because Tony Blair was able to work seamlessly with him.  Mr. Ahern did not think we were trying to pull something over on him at any stage.  We were not, and <i>vice versa<\/i>.  I built my relations with Paddy Teahon in the Taoiseach's office and later with Michael Collins.  Of course, it was at every level of government.  As the Deputy said, once there are good relations between the principals it is much easier to have good relations all the way down the official chain.<br\/><br\/>It was also important that we were running this Northern Ireland thing from 10 Downing Street.  Sometimes we were criticised for that, but it was a symbol of how important getting to peace in Northern Ireland was to Tony Blair.  He wanted it to take up a good deal of time for himself, his chief of staff and 10 Downing Street.  One of the problems we have now is that 10 Downing Street has largely backed out of Irish questions, except when it comes to being destructive with the protocol.  That is a mistake.  It is important for 10 Downing Street to stay involved.<br\/><br\/>Beyond that, it was then important for trust to be built with the parties.  Mo Mowlam, who I pay tribute to, played a very important role in building trust with nationalists, in particular, after the election.  She was very different from her predecessors, who were good men but very much in the mould of Guards officers rather than more normal representatives of the British public.  She managed to break a lot of ice in opinions in Northern Ireland.  I always think of Mo Mowlam as a necessary but not sufficient cause of peace.  If we had not had her, it would have been very difficult to build that trust.<br\/><br\/>It was also important to build trust on the unionist side.  Tony Blair devoted a lot of time, as did I, to trying to build a relationship of trust with the unionists.  He spent a great deal of time talking to political leaders.  There is an investment in building trust.  In fact, an anecdote about later on in the negotiations illustrates it.  It was when we were trying to get the DUP into a peace agreement after it won the elections in Northern Ireland.  We were in Leeds Castle and the whole thing fell apart when we were trying to get the Good Friday Agreement implemented, before we got to the St. Andrews Agreement.  I remember Tony Blair and I going up to one of the bedrooms and sitting on a four-poster bed with Peter Robinson and asking how we were going to do this.  He said that we had to build trust with Ian Paisley.  He said we needed to talk to him, and not just about politics but about religion and other things.  Tony Blair then devoted hundreds of hours to sitting with Ian Paisley and talking about faith and matters relating to religion rather than politics.  That played an important part in building trust with Rev. Paisley so we were able eventually to get to the St. Andrews Agreement.<br\/><br\/>The Deputy is right to say that trust was central to what happened then.  The destruction of trust, to be honest, is the tragedy of what is happening now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>I will move on and if Mr. Powell is still with us we will have a second round.

There is talk about consent but despite every single party on this island being against the legacy proposals, they are being introduced.  The UK Government is talking about respect for the Good Friday Agreement and, at the same time, undermining the European Convention on Human Rights.

However, it appears that what is happening is an attempt to try to redefine consent and the idea of cross-community consensus and cross-community agreement.  It is dangerous to try to bleed these things so they mean something other than they meant in the Good Friday Agreement.  Changing the meaning of terms could undermine the whole basis of the agreement.  What is required by the Good Friday Agreement is consent to change the status of Northern Ireland.  That is not cross-community consent; it is consent of the majority.  According to opinion polls, there is no majority to change the status of Northern Ireland now.  I do not know when that majority might ever exist but it does not exist now.  It does not require a majority of both communities; it requires a majority of the population.<\/p> <p>  As I understand the protocol, change also requires the consent of a majority in the Northern Ireland Assembly, not a cross-community majority.  That is trying to shift this issue to take a cross-community angle.  As I say, I am not an expert and I may be misstating the situation but this is my understanding.  To play with the words involved, as the current UK Government is doing, is dangerous.  The cross-community aspect has always been important and was a crucial element of the Good Friday Agreement.  What we needed after 90-odd years of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland was to find a way where there could be proper power-sharing.  We could not accept one community lording it over the other the entire time.  There had to be an ability for both communities to have a share.  Interestingly, that was then to protect the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland, and if it is now used to protect a Protestant and unionist minority, which may be the case when we see the next census and which has happened politically, we should respect it equally.  Starting to monkey around with those terms and how they are applied is dangerous, even if one is only doing it rhetorically, as the British Government has been doing.<\/p> <p>  There is a longer-term question that will need to be discussed, in that power-sharing may not be the right answer for Northern Ireland indefinitely.  Power-sharing in Bosnia, for example, has been destructive in the long term because there can be no political change.  It would be dangerous to start changing power-sharing at this stage in Northern Ireland's existence, given the sensitivity involved.  The Alliance Party has some very good points on that issue and ways need to be found to accommodate them.  However, I do not think it would be wise to undermine the Good Friday Agreement in respect of consent and cross-community agreement at this stage when everything is being stirred up by Brexit and the introduction of the protocol.<\/p> <p>  That is not a very satisfactory answer.  I worry when the current British Prime Minister is taking these terms and trying to adapt them to what he wants politically rather than accepting what was actually stated in the agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1085,"content":"<p>Would that position continue even if Boris Johnson were not at the helm?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#D00500","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1086,"content":"<p>The truth of what is happening on the protocol, unfortunately, is that it has a lot to do with the Conservative Party and very little to do with Northern Ireland.  It is about the leadership of the Conservative Party.  For Boris Johnson, shoring up his position in the Conservative Party requires him to pander to the Brexit radicals in the European Research Group, ERG.  That is what he is doing.  Liz Truss, unfortunately, is now in charge of this negotiation.  She is also pandering to the same people in the hope of getting their votes to succeed Boris Johnson.  However, if there is a leadership election in the Conservative Party and a new Prime Minister, even if it were to be Liz Truss, I would be very surprised if the British Government carries on the same theme of pandering to the ERG in the same way.  Any responsible Prime Minister would immediately try to rebuild trust, restart negotiations and not risk making things worse in Northern Ireland by reopening issues of consent and cross-community agreement.  That is my hope and my belief but I may, of course, be wrong.<\/p> <p>  The Senator also asked about the union, which requires a long answer.  I will try to give a brief answer on that.  I think people fail to fully comprehend how the constitutional futures of Scotland and Northern Ireland impact on each other.  We tend to look at them in isolation whereas, in fact, they will interact with each other.  If a Conservative Government tells the Scottish people it will not agree to a referendum but it then agrees to a border poll in Northern Ireland, for example, those approaches will be incompatible.  If the circumstances for a border poll were met and the British Government rejected it, that would not be complying with the basis of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p> <p>  The opinion polls when Boris Johnson ran for leader were interesting.  They showed that a majority of those who voted for him in the Conservative Party leadership contest, amounting to approximately 100,000 voters, were clearly prepared to lose Scotland and Northern Ireland if they could get Brexit.  That is mindset of the people who got Boris Johnson the job of Prime Minister.  For those people, the future of the union is not that important compared with Brexit.  That is an important political marker, if you like, for what might happen to the union in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#D00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1087,"content":"<p>Mr. Powell has been vocal about the need to reach out to loyalists and for them to engage in political solutions and not to go down the paramilitary route.

I thought the idea of the loyalist council was good because leaving the loyalists behind and ignoring them is not an answer.  Issues of crime must be dealt with but there is serious deprivation in loyalist areas.  There is a figure, which I believe to be true, that some loyalist enclaves in Belfast have the lowest educational attainment rates in Europe.  That is worrying.  Turning our backs on loyalists, or just using them as cannon fodder, if you like, as some politicians do, is a big mistake for the stability of the future of Northern Ireland.

It is not new.  The positive role played by Bill and Hilary Clinton and by George Mitchell was really quite extraordinary and played a major part in the success of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations and implementation.  Subsequent envoys also played more or less important roles depending on what was going on.  Richard Haass played an important role when he was the envoy.  I am slightly in two minds about whether an envoy now would be helpful.  It would only be helpful if it was acceptable to both sides.  In the case of George Mitchell, leaving aside his saintly patience in being prepared to sit down for so long and take a lot of grief, and his commitment to doing it, he was trusted by both sides.  He really was.  That was enormously important.  If an envoy is going to be useful, he or she will have to be able to win the trust of both sides in Northern Ireland.

He states the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements were remarkably successful.  I think we can all agree with that.  They brought peace to this island.  They ended a 30-year conflict and, as Mr. Powell says, they allowed political parties to concentrate on the day-to-day issues that affect people living in the North.  However, Brexit has undermined the Good Friday Agreement and everything that was achieved by it and by subsequent agreements.  We have to acknowledge as well that there are still elements of those agreements that have not been implemented, thus the necessity for this committee.<\/p> <p>  In recent months and particularly recent weeks, however, I am seeing the undermining of everything the Good Friday Agreement stands for.  It is being undermined by a small minority of people who live on this island - the DUP - and by the actions of the British Government.  The British Government is about to breach an international agreement as it pursues its legislation in Westminster on the protocol.  We think it is going totally the wrong way around trying to resolve the issues.  We have no institutions in the North.

I think I would distinguish between the DUP and the British Government in all of this.  The DUP is not the first or the only party to bring down the institutions since the Good Friday Agreement.  They have been brought down a number of times by different parties for different reasons.  I think it is tragic that they have brought them down.  It is incredibly important to get them up again as fast as possible.  Most people who have worked on the issue of Northern Ireland in Britain agree that is something that must be done.<br\/><br\/>I have noticed the British Government has different demands from the DUP.  As I understand it, the DUP position is that it wants the Sainsbury's test to be met, that is, fairly practical issues to be addressed, and they are not so bothered about the European Court of Justice and ideological issues which the British Government has raised and which have very little to do with people in Northern Ireland.  The danger and difficulty here is that this has all been played into Conservative Party politics, which is not in the best interests of Northern Ireland.  Personally, I think it is important the DUP and all the parties in Northern Ireland are in dialogue with the EU about this.  The EU should really be taking into account the interests of all of the parties in Northern Ireland about how the protocol works, its advantages, which many businesses fear will be threatened by what is happening, as well as the DUP's concerns, which are largely to do with identity but also the Sainsbury's test.  I would distinguish between the DUP and the British Government on this.<br\/><br\/>I know it sounds rather hopeless to say we should wait for a new Prime Minister, but since I am hoping and believing that is going to happen quite soon, what I would be doing if I was in the Irish Government is preparing for negotiations post-Boris Johnson.  If he stays, we are going to have a real problem.  I just do not see how an EU negotiator can trust the Government that has done these things against the law.  It is just really difficult to see how they can.  For the Irish Government, too, it is extremely complicated.  I am afraid I do not have a magic answer as to what we can do as long as Boris Johnson stays in power, apart from pray, which is not necessarily a political solution.<br\/><br\/>On the border poll and what the requirements were, it is a long time ago and I cannot claim to have a very good memory of this but I do not think the actual terms were ever discussed in much detail.  I do not believe there is some secret drawer in the British Government where it is written down on paper what the Secretary of State will have to see before he calls a border poll.  I do not think that exists.  I do not know.  I cannot be sure.  I have been out of government since 2007.  Certainly in 2007 there was not some drawer one would open in case of a census showing a majority or plurality of nationalists rather than unionists.  I do think the Deputy is right is saying that preparing is important.  What worries me most of all, in a way, combined with the mayhem caused by Brexit, is the sort of oath of <i>omerta<\/i>that everyone seems to have taken on the issue of what unification would mean.<\/p><p>The trouble with Brexit was that we saw it as being something very soft, like the situation with Norway, but it turned out to be something completely different.  If one wants the more than 1 million people in Northern Ireland not to be scared about what a united Ireland might be like, there needs to be a discussion about how minority rights can be protected and the role of Stormont.  I understand why the Irish and British Governments do not want to talk about it.  In the end, that is a mistake.  When one does not talk about things, they become scarier.  I do not think a majority for a border poll is imminent, but refusing to talk about the issue is almost certainly a mistake.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Powell to the committee.

It brings back memories.  Inclusion was absolutely crucial.  The Sunningdale Agreement did not work because of lack of inclusion.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement did not work for the same reason.  The fundamental change we made was to have inclusive talks.  John Major always tried to move to that but was not able to do so.  As I work on negotiations around the world, that is perhaps the single most important lesson I take away from Northern Ireland.  If one tries to have a process that is not inclusive of those people who have political support, one is unlikely to solve the problem, because, in the end, there is usually a political problem at the root, whether it is in Colombia or anywhere else, such as the Basque country.  Inclusion was fundamental.<\/p> <p>  John Major found himself in a difficult position of trying to bring Sinn F&eacute;in in.  That delay made people give up hope and tragically pushed us back into violence again.  That is why Tony Blair took a risk by moving as fast as he conceivably could to bring Sinn F&eacute;in in under the Mitchell Principles.  That was the key to success.  That did not suddenly make things easy, which is never the way in Northern Ireland.  The unionists would not even talk to Sinn F&eacute;in during the talks, even in the gents' toilets, which led to all the jokes about it.  It went on for a long time.  Even when it came to negotiations with the DUP, it would not meet directly, or at least not publicly, with Sinn F&eacute;in and there had to be much shuttling backwards and forwards.  The lesson about inclusion is important not only for Northern Ireland but for everywhere else in the world too.  I hope people learn it.<\/p> <p>  Some people say that there is no problem and ask why people are making a fuss.  I do not think that is right.  Clearly, if there is a border in the Irish Sea, that is a problem for their identity.  There is a border between them and the rest of the United Kingdom.  Pretending that is not a problem will make things worse rather than better.  The difficulty is, as Ms Gildernew says, that Brexit, the Good Friday Agreement and the status of Northern Ireland were always insoluble.  I spent much time pointing it out during the referendum and subsequent to it.  There has to be a border somewhere.  We spent six years trying to think of an alternative and no one has come up with one.  There has to be a border in the Irish Sea because it cannot be on the island of Ireland.  Even the unionists are not proposing that it should be on the island of Ireland because they know how dangerous that would be.  They are just saying that we should not have a border, which is nonsense, because there has to be a border.  The question is whether we can settle this by removing the practical problems, which the protocol attempts to do.<\/p> <p>  I think the EU has to be as flexible as possible.  I can see that it has been flexible but it has to be more flexible on matters such as a green lane, which I think it can do within the terms of its mandate.  If I was the EU, I would not do so now, because it will get nothing back from the negotiation.  If it can get to a serious negotiation, it has a chance of resolving the issue.<\/p> <p>  I would say to loyalists that they have been exploited and used by other politicians throughout their history.  They should really be standing up for and talking about their very deprived communities.  They are right.  That should be done politically.  They should not let some of their people slip back into threats of violence.  Ignoring the loyalists is a terrible mistake.  It may be a small group of people, but it has a significant interest.  We have to find a way to engage.  Irish politicians have been much better at engaging with loyalists than any British politicians.

It will be very controversial when it comes to time for the Northern Ireland Secretary to make a decision.  A Secretary resisting a border poll in light of repeated opinion polls that show a majority in favour of a united Ireland would be on very tricky ground legally, politically and in every other way.  This is why I see it as interacting with Scotland and the referendum there.  It does not interact legally but politically.  If &quot;No&quot; is said to one and &quot;Yes&quot; is said to the other or <i>vice versa<\/i>it will be a real problem.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the Labour Party, it is possible to be in favour of the union yet say it is up to the people in Northern Ireland to decide on their future.  That is not incompatible.  I would favour Scotland remaining in a union with the United Kingdom but in the end it is up to the people of Scotland to decide.  This is the point of consent.  I think the same about Northern Ireland.  I would like Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom but it is up to the people of Northern Ireland.  I do not think there is quite the stark line.  What this all resulted from, as committee members know, is a Tory attack on the Labour Party trying to make it nervous.  It is all about terminology rather than anything else.  It must be for the people of Northern Ireland to decide their future and not anyone else.  This is clear from the Good Friday Agreement.<br\/><br\/>I must admit I have not given much thought to a citizens' assembly.  I said earlier that a failure to debate and discuss what a united Ireland might mean in practice would be quite dangerous.  The example of Brexit is quite salient.  If we had had a proper debate about what sort of Brexit we were speaking about and if people had realised what was happening there would have been very different numbers in the vote.  We see the opinion polls in Britain now.  They show very clearly that the majority of people think Brexit has been a failure.  This is a danger in Northern Ireland.  If there is a border poll without saying what will happen afterwards it would be dangerous.  I do not know whether a citizens' assembly would be the right way to do it.  It would only work if it were inclusive.  As we have been saying, inclusivity works both ways.  Everyone needs to be at the table if there is to be a proper discussion.  It is worth discussing.  There might be some trouble persuading unionists to participate in a citizens' assembly on this at present but perhaps at some stage it would be possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#G00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1103,"content":"<p>It is nice to hear from Mr. Powell.  We are having a great discussion.  I want to pick up on some commentary that I saw on social media before I came to the meeting.  It is from Gordon Brown.  He said that Britain is at war with the United States over Ireland.  He said this with regard to Brexit and in particular with regard to the trade deal.  He said it is now likely there will not be a trade deal between the United States and Britain unless the issues regarding Ireland are resolved in the time ahead.  I want to get Mr. Powell's perspective on this.  I have read that he did some work on the legislation being brought through Westminster by the British Government on the protocol.  He commented that it would undermine the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.  What is his thinking on a future trade deal with the United States?  How long does he think this will go on?  Does he think there will be a solution?  It cannot be easy with the current Prime Minister.<br\/><br\/>The Good Friday Agreement has many elements and aspects that have not yet been implemented.  One in particular is the bill of rights for the North.  At the time huge focus was placed on human rights and ensuring the protection of all citizens on the island of Ireland and particularly in the North.  To date we do not have a bill of rights.  The New Decade, New Approach deal sought to establish an <i>ad hoc<\/i>committee to oversee and consider implementation of a bill of rights.  Unfortunately we do not yet have it.

My view is that a US-UK trade deal is pretty unlikely in the foreseeable future anyway, regardless of Northern Ireland, because the US is not in the business of doing trade deals at present.  If it were it would be doing them in the Pacific.  Even if it were, the negotiations would be incredibly difficult and long.  There is a reason the EU and US have not managed to come to a trade deal despite repeated efforts.  I am not holding my breath waiting for a US-UK trade deal but I am certain there will not be one if the UK is in breach of the protocol and international law.  Why would a country even start negotiating a trade deal with a government that was not prepared to respect agreements that were designed not so long ago.  This is a dead issue in every way.  I know the US Government is pressing the British Government on the protocol.  I hope it has influence, along with Congress and the EU itself.  Here we are all allied on Ukraine but we are trying to undermine it by breaching agreements with our own allies.  It is crazy.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the bill of rights I have a strong memory of lengthy discussions on the subject.  Unfortunately I cannot remember at what stage we agreed what on the bill of rights.

It would be another very big problem in the context of Northern Ireland if it tried to do so.  Any British lawyer will say it is not possible for it to do so.  I do not think it actually will.  I can see why people would be nervous when we have not fulfilled the commitment on a bill of rights and we are speaking about quitting the ECHR.  It makes it a very live political issue.

I do not know about this.  In a way what happened during that time was that it allowed trust to be built through the negotiation.  I have seen this elsewhere in the world.  In many ways implementation is the single most important thing about a peace agreement.  A peace agreement is never just a piece of paper.  It does not build trust.  We have a piece of paper because the two sides do not trust each other.  They only come to trust each other when they start to implement it.

It is because no one implements them.<\/p> <p>  The long painful process on decommissioning, getting the institutions up and running, and implementing the human rights provisions, language provisions and policing was not a waste.

Mr. Powell talked about the period from 2004 to 2006 when trust was being built.  From 2007 to 2011, Ian Paisley Senior became First Minister and Martin McGuinness became deputy First Minister, or joint First Ministers, which was probably the peak of the relationship.  I look back at that time and think about the media and how people mocked their relationship by describing them as \"the chuckle brothers\" and so on but that was our best period of stability.  When Peter Robinson replaced Ian Paisley as First Minister we saw the letter from America on the future of the Long Kesh site and how trust unravelled.  I have watched subsequent First Ministers concede an increasing amount of that positive working relationship.  I mean from the time of Peter Robinson to Arlene Foster, to Edwin Poots for a period and now Jeffrey Donaldson.  Moreover, in the middle of all of that we had Brexit.  It is my opinion that while political unionism has failed to engage with a lot of us on our future there certainly is a very broad sphere within civic unionism of those who are prepared to have those conversations and are interested in planning the future.<\/p> <p>  Earlier there was talk about inclusivity, whether Stormont has a future and Mr. Mickey Brady asked about a citizens' assembly.

I seek Mr. Powell's thoughts on all of that.  I am sure he has talked to some of the same people to whom I have talked and he probably has heard all of this as well.

To be honest, that is pretty worrying but that may again be about personalities.  I personally think that Jeffrey Donaldson is in a difficult position politically but when he was a deputy to Ian Paisley Snr., he was able to work very well across the aisle.  Consequently, it is possible that Jeffrey, in different political circumstances, could work perfectly well across the political aisle on these things.<\/p> <p>  It did worry me that when we lost Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, things got worse.  Frankly, there was something pretty disturbing about that.  Ms Gildernew is right that we need a broader discussion and I would take it further than what she said.  She is right that civic unionism needs to be involved but I also think, she may not agree not agree with me on this point, that the rise of the Alliance Party and the middle ground, which will be very apparent in the census, is interesting and provides ballast for making cross-community things work in a different way.  I mean that it does not have to be about identity and could be about issues such as the National Health Service, NHS, which was mentioned.  It is paradoxical that there is a hospital in Derry that provides healthcare to people from Donegal with heart and other medical issues.  One would have thought that practical co-operation things would be something that everyone could work on from both communities or neither community.  That probably is the future, and I hope that is the future in Northern Ireland.  The way forward is to get teeth into practical issues like that while involving unionists, nationalists, republicans and those who are neither.  That can happen, and I hope I see it beginning to happen.  Ms Gildernew is right that one talks to what one might call civic unionism.  If one talks to middle-class unionist people in golf clubs and rugby clubs, they are going to take a much more nuanced view of the economy and the future of Ireland as a whole.

I give him full credit for his involvement at a difficult time in terms of the Good Friday Agreement and what happened afterwards.<\/p> <p>  In light of more recent events and something that to an extent was stated as being a concern at the time, namely, the division of the Assembly under the Good Friday Agreement in terms of delineation and designation of members as they enter the Assembly in regard to what block they adhered to.  I think there are two blocks and a category of \"other\".  I recall that at the time, even though I was a steadfast and ardent supporter of the agreement and was delighted to see it being passed overwhelmingly on both sides of the island, there were some writings, particularly by those on the left who said that some representatives may not fit easily into either category and they were not satisfied with the other category.  At the time it was probably quite an abstract academic concern but it has become more prominent and a live issue right now, and we see that with the Alliance Party and maybe some others.  Perhaps that is an attitude that may grow.  Already in this afternoon's session, we have heard talk about a middle ground.  I understand that it was a necessary step to get cross-community consensus at the time.  Does Mr. Powell envisage the matter will be revisited later as things, dare I say, become normalised or matured?

Earlier I briefly mentioned that I think this is an important issue.  It was crucial at the time to have power-sharing and, therefore, a way of reaching cross-community agreements.  Due to the history of Northern Ireland where one party and one tradition had ruled totally and no-one else had a look in, you had to have a system that allowed power-sharing and allowed issues to be agreed by both communities together.  I think that was a fundamental basis of the agreement.<\/p> <p>  There is a problem, however, and I have written about it a bit in the past, when it becomes permanent, as in Bosnia, when this can be a real problem.  In Bosnia it led to appalling corruption, regimes are in power the whole time, there is no way to challenge them and one cannot get them out.  It is leading now to really serious intergroup tensions and may well bust the actual peace agreement.  So some flexibility needs to be built into this.  The Alliance Party made a very fair point by asking what about us, and if one just has designation then even though we have a heck of a lot of votes, we do not get a say in these things because we are not designating one side or the other.  As I have said already, it would be a mistake to upturn this at the moment because things are so sensitive.  As I have also complained, when the current British Prime Minister is trying to redefine the terms of consent and cross-community consensus in a dangerous way, then we should stick pretty firmly to what is said in the agreement at the moment.  If we can get the institutions up and running again and get back to stability in Northern Ireland, then there would be time to start thinking about the future.  I mean this was all built-in initially to defend a Catholic or nationalist minority against unionist hegemony.  Now the unionists, I suspect, will be a minority after the census and they may need protection too, so I think to change it just at that moment would be particularly pointed and not a good idea.<\/p><p>The Deputy is absolutely right that if this goes on forever, the Northern Ireland political system will not work so we will have to think about some way of getting to more normal politics.

It was them.  I believe John Hume and David Trimble deserve their Nobel Peace Prize because in the end what we and the Irish Government were doing was trying to facilitate between the different sides.  In particular, John Hume demonstrated real political bravery in reaching out to Gerry Adams at an early stage and being excoriated for it at the time.  That should be well remembered by future generations for what he did.<\/p> <p>  On David Trimble, we have had some conversations over the years about this and he always says he was appalled that I was surprised that he was going to be brave in making peace.  I was surprised because he got his job by being on the radical end of the party and yet when he got it he was determined to make peace, particularly around the time of Drumcree.  He spoke up when that unfortunate family was burned to death and I thought he was very brave.  I thought he was committed to making peace, which was fundamentally important.<\/p> <p>  I add to this Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, who led their movement, at great personal risk, into making peace.  They also deserve an enormous amount of credit.  There were substantial politicians and political leaders.  Ian Paisley was not the sort of politician who would succeed in British politics but after he came back from his illness in 2004, he came back a rather different man.  He told us he wanted to finish his life as \"Dr. Yes\" and not \"Dr. No\".  He did not suddenly fold and make concessions but he really tried to get to peace, even when the rest of his party did not seem that keen on it.  He, too, posthumously deserves an enormous amount of credit being given to him.<\/p> <p>  It is very important the British and Irish Governments could work so closely together but the real credit goes to those politicians.  Northern Ireland was very lucky to have those politicians at that time.<\/p> <p>  On the role of the US Administration, I mentioned briefly that the role played by Bill Clinton was crucial from an early stage in sending out George Mitchell, as opposed to an economic envoy.  George looked at the question of decommissioning and came up with the Mitchell principles, as well as chairing the talks.  We would not have done it without that and there is no way there would have been a successful peace process without that happening.<\/p> <p>  Bill Clinton himself played a role in the three days around Good Friday on the phone, staying up all night and cajoling people.  I particularly remember his call to the unionist leadership and I came down to tell them it was happening.  That was the Ulster Unionist Party.  There were also subsequent visits in trying to ensure the process worked.  I include Hillary as well as Bill Clinton and both were really committed to the Northern Ireland peace process.<\/p> <p>  We could go back even further because when I was at the British embassy in Washington, my job was to stop Gerry Adams getting a visa to go to the US before a ceasefire.  I thought I had it covered because I had the CIA, the State Department, the FBI and everyone else saying \"No\" but then at the last minute Senator Ted Kennedy did an end run on me through Nancy Soderberg to Bill Clinton and got him a visa.  In retrospect, it was exactly the right thing to do; what Bill Clinton did was to give political hope.  It was a very wise, albeit quite costly, decision in a political sense.  John Major was not very happy and would not speak to him for three days afterwards.  Maybe we could have made peace without the American role but it made it a heck of a lot easier and much more likely to succeed with the role played by Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell, as well as many other American officials.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#J00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1119,"content":"<p>Senator McGahon is just back from meeting all those congressmen in America.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#J00500","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1120,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Powell for appearing before us and we really appreciate it.

At what point in Tony Blair's leadership between opposition and government did Northern Ireland become big on the agenda?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#J00600","speaker":"1670"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>I touched on this before but I can elaborate.  As soon as he became leader on taking over from John Smith, one of the first things he did was to reverse the Labour Party's policy on Northern Ireland from being a persuader for unity to supporting John Major in the peace process almost regardless of anything else.  He stuck to that.  He wanted a policy of bipartisanship and he supported John Major even when he thought he was doing things wrong on Northern Ireland because he thought it so important that the peace process worked and he had consensus.  From working in places like Colombia and Spain, we know that if there is not political consensus, it can become a political football and much harder to make peace.  It was really a very wise decision and the Tories sort of stuck to it in subsequent years while we were in government.  We had bipartisanship on the Northern Ireland issue, which was crucial.<\/p> <p>  The question on his personal commitment is interesting.  I cannot quite explain it.  He said it was something to do with his Orangewoman grandmother in Donegal on his summer holidays - I believe there is something to that - and he was conscious of Northern Ireland.  In opposition, we spent time thinking about Northern Ireland.  We met Sir John Chilcot, who at that stage was the Permanent Secretary in the Northern Ireland Office, along with Mo Mowlam, and we spent time thinking about what we would do in government.<\/p> <p>  As I mentioned, Tony wanted his first visit after becoming Prime Minister in May 1997 to be to Northern Ireland.  The first time he went outside London, eight days after his election, he went to the agricultural show at Balmoral and made a speech to reassure unionists.  He was afraid, correctly, that unionists would be nervous about a Labour Government and would think we would sell them out.  There had not been such a government for a long time and they had memories of Harold Wilson and so on.<\/p> <p>  He was determined to use the political capital he got from his election to help solve the Northern Ireland issue.  Again, as I said, there is no political advantage to that in Britain and one does not get any votes for making peace in Northern Ireland.  To his credit, John Major devoted much time and effort to trying to make peace, again with no political benefit in Britain.<\/p><p>However, for Tony Blair it was not something he got interested in when in government.  It was something he felt very deeply and in opposition he had decided this was going to be one of his top priorities.  As I mentioned earlier, he took risks.  There was risk in expediting things like bringing Sinn F&eacute;in in very quickly, which was dangerous for him, keeping the unionists in and persuading them to stay in despite the DUP being out and then saying he would get to an agreement within a year.  His analysis was John Major had allowed the thing to unravel by not getting into inclusive talks.  He found it politically difficult to do so and he kept Sinn F&eacute;in in the waiting room, which was a political mistake.  I understand why he did it - his script was limited - but that was what Tony Blair was determined to do.<\/p><p> Again, as I mentioned earlier, the civil servants were telling him not to do it, that is, not to have a deadline of one year because if he did that, the whole thing would have gone bust and we would have had nothing to work with.  They told him to play it long but he insisted on having that deadline.  When we turned up in Belfast, I remember George Mitchell saying to Tony \"I don't know why you've come.  There's no chance of an agreement\".  We did not feel very good when he made that famous sound bite about the hand of history when we went into Hillsborough.  He decided it was really important, he put his political capital into it and he really devoted a huge amount of time to it over his ten years as Prime Minister.  He spent a great deal of time talking to unionist leaders, to Ian Paisley, to Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, to David Trimble, to John Hume and to all the leaders of the other parties, including Alliance.  No British Prime Minister since the 19th century devoted that much time to the Irish question.  Luckily, this time it actually led to success.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#J00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1123,"content":"<p>Absolutely.

I remember talking to him about being a new MP in the 1997 intake.  Mr. Powell is quite right there was zero political advantage for Tony Blair in even getting involved in Northern Ireland.

There may have been ups and downs but basically we had pretty solid support.  As I said, there was the bipartisan aspect of getting the Tories to support us as we had supported them, which they more or less did.  Occasionally, Iain Duncan Smith would play politics with it, but William Hague, for example, was pretty supportive.

It is always good to have a Prime Minister who will listen to their civil servants but make their own way forward.  Some very serious civil servants seem to have been lost recently in Britain.  They resigned at that time.  They were probably some top-class administrators in Britain who were very much behind what Tony Blair and Mr. Powell were doing at that time.  I feel the absence of that moderate or middle ground opinion on all these issues, especially under Boris Johnson.  He is a bit like Trump in that whatever is in his head on the day is what he does regardless.  I note his comments on a new Roman empire in Europe.  He is living in the 18th century, if not the 17th, as far as his view of Britain in the world is concerned.<\/p> <p>  On a positive note, what we must do, and our roles as politicians who are members of this committee, is build our relationships with the parties in the UK, including the Tory Party, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats too.  One thing that is absent is our presence over there and their presence here, because of Covid and so on.  One of our tasks is to do that.  The second one is to engage with unionism.  The most important point Mr. Powell made was there are one million people in Northern Ireland for whom, if we are to bring them into a united Ireland, we must ensure first that the Good Friday Agreement works and that we have consensus and change, North-South bodies that work and an Executive that works.  Senator Currie and I were talking about this earlier.  I am just commenting here rather than putting a question to Mr. Powell, but this has to be our priority as well.  That is the committee's job.  Our biggest problem is engaging with unionism.  I do not know if anybody else feels that here.  Senator Currie may wish to comment on it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#K00900","speaker":"1598"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>Following on from my question earlier, I am interested to hear how Mr. Powell feels we should be engaging with the Protestant, unionist and loyalist community.  I very much feel there is no role for paramilitarism.  It should have left the stage a long time ago and in fact the problems we talk about in terms of cycles of poverty, drugs, coercive control of communities, prosperity and hope are not going to be solved by paramilitaries.  How would Mr. Powell advise us to engage with loyalism but not paramilitarism?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#K01000","speaker":"1648"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>Let me start with that and then go back to what the Chairman said.  On the paramilitarism, it is very hard to distinguish between it and political tendencies.  That would be true in our dealings with Sinn F&eacute;in, when we were criticised for talking to terrorists, and you are talking to people who have dual roles, military and political.  In the case of the loyalists I would go further than the Senator and say not just should they not exist now but that they should never have existed.  They should never have been involved in paramilitarism.  The trouble is, in the absence of strong political leaders if you do not engage the groups at all they find themselves exploited more and more by unscrupulous politicians from other parties and less and less able to express the political views of their communities.<\/p> <p>  Always in these cases you want a dual-track approach.  You need a really tough security approach on the paramilitarism and the criminality because the people who are suffering are their own communities.  It is not someone else who is suffering for what they are doing and their drug-dealing, prostitution and all the rest of it.  It is their communities.  The police have to, and I believe have been, finding better ways to try to tackle that and they really should come down hard on that criminality.  At the same time as you push down, you should have a political way out.  Those communities need to have a voice of some sort.  I do not think they find their voice in the existing political parties in Northern Ireland.  I mean the big political parties.  It would be a mistake to just ignore them, even if they are not very large groups.  I would take that dual approach of a security and police approach. In fact, if the security service has a role, it should involve that as well as dissident republicans, because it is equally a threat and needs to be dealt with.<\/p><p> In terms of the parliaments, there are many leaders on the backbenches in both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party who would share my views and feel strongly about trying to maintain the good relationship we have built between the two countries.  They are committed to maintaining the Good Friday Agreement.  I urge the committee to reach out to those parliamentarians and act as a bridge.  I hope this will be a temporary phenomenon and Boris Johnson will lead us back to a better relationship and negotiations to resolve the protocol issue.  While it can be difficult to engage with unionists, I urge the committee to persevere and not to give up just because they said \"No\" the first two or three times.  Even if it sometimes means private engagement rather than public, I would urge that.  It can be frustrating.  I spent ten years doing it, so I know it is frustrating but it is definitely worth doing.  If you are not talking to them, their fears can become compounded and multiplied and more dangerous.  What I learned from ten years of working on the Northern Ireland peace process is the more engagement the better.  Without engagement, a vacuum is opened up that all too often gets filled by violence.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/GFJ2022063000002#K01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jonathan Powell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1134,"content":"<p>We are reaching the end of our discussion with Mr. Powell.

The challenge now is finding additional ways to engage with unionists on the issue of a new Ireland.  That engagement is going on and that trust is being built.

Any unionist, let alone a unionist political leader, does not want to find themselves caught out and accused of being a Lundy.  We have to find ways of making that conversation safe.  Ideally, that would involve the two Governments, although it is difficult with the current state of the British Government.  If there were two positive Governments trying to do something, that might make it easier because they could provide the political umbrella that would allow such discussions to take place without people getting criticised, the same way they did during the talks process.  I do not want to say we are waiting for Boris for everything but we are waiting, or preparing, for a period where that is possible.  If the Irish Government can establish a citizens' assembly or something else like that, that is what I would spend my time doing.  One has to make it a safe space for unionists to do this.  They do not want their political careers curtailed because they are caught talking publicly about a united Ireland.  It needs to be a sensible thing for them to be doing.  Even if they were to say why they do not want it, at least that is a discussion.  I do not have a magic answer.  It is about trying to get to a dialogue.

So that everyone is on the same page, some of the witnesses are participating remotely - we can see them on screen - while others are physically with us in the committee room.  This is a hybrid model that we have become accustomed to in recent times and it works well.  Members will be doing the same, with some logging in remotely and others physically present in the room.<\/p> <p>  The purpose of this meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders as part of the committee's scrutiny of the general scheme of the communications (retention of data) (amendment) Bill 2022.  Before I formally welcome the witnesses and get into the substance of the matter, I wish to point out that it is important that we have this meeting.  This is the second meeting that the committee has held this week on this legislation.  It is important legislation, which we will hear a great deal about and discuss over the next hour or two.  It addresses a number of lacunas in the law arising from various European court decisions, decisions of the High Court and other court decisions even prior to that.  It was the strong view of the committee that it was important that we give this Bill due diligence.  We are mindful that there is an urgent deadline, with the Oireachtas&rsquo;s summer recess coming.  We understand the urgency and desire on the part of the Government to get this legislation passed quickly, but we also feel that quick is not always right and that we should review the Bill, take a position on it and make various recommendations, which can only assist the legislation as it progresses through the Houses.  I thank the members of the committee, the staff and everyone across the board for working with me on this.  I hope that we will produce a report, albeit a shortened one, this evening following our meeting.  That report can only be helpful to the Minister and the Department.  It is important that we do our constitutional duty in scrutinising legislation that is referred to us.<\/p> <p>  The following witnesses are attending remotely: Mr. Ronan Lupton, senior counsel; Dr. T.J. McIntyre, associate professor at the school of law in UCD; Mr. Dale Sunderland and Mr. Gary Russell from the Data Protection Commission, DPC; and Mr. Justin Kelly, assistant commissioner over organised and serious crime, and Mr. Michael Flynn, detective superintendent in the security and intelligence service, from the Office of the Garda Commissioner.  Joining us in the room is Mr. Dan Kelleher, principal officer in the criminal legislation division of the Department of Justice.  It is Mr. Kelleher's second time joining us this week.  He was good enough to give us a private briefing on Monday.  I apologise in advance to those who attended on Monday because there may be some duplication of questions, but members felt it important that some of the issues explored in private session be teased out in public session.  It is for the benefit of others that we have some repetition.<\/p> <p>  To allow the meeting to flow smoothly, I ask that everyone participating remotely mute his or her device when not speaking and to unmute it when speaking.  We are all used to that at this stage.<\/p> <p>  I will invite each organisation to make an opening statement of three minutes.  When two or more witnesses are attending from the same organisation, they can decide among themselves whether one person will speak for the others, whether they will take 90 seconds each or whatever way they want to do it.  Normally, one person makes an opening statement on behalf of his or her organisation.  The witnesses will have plenty of time after the opening statements to engage in discussion with the committee.  Having a short opener will allow time later in the meeting to explore issues.  After the opening statements, I will go around the table to committee members.  Each member will have seven minutes in which to put questions, make observations and hear answers.  Those seven minutes will be shown on a clock at the top of the screen, allowing us to keep an eye on the time.  If a member wants to make a speech for seven minutes or to use the seven minutes to ask seven questions and hear answers to them, that is fine.  However the member wishes to use that time is up to him or her.<\/p> <p>  I will call on the organisations in a moment.  I have been made aware that Mr. Lupton is due in the High Court at 11 a.m.  This session may run a little after that, but I will allow him to make his statement first.  If there are questions for him, members should direct them to him early.  He will probably have to leave us at 10.30 a.m. to get to court.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that, although this meeting was put together at short notice, the witnesses have made themselves available.  It assists the work of the committee greatly to have them in the room with us as key stakeholders and knowledgeable experts.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Lupton will be up first.

My opening statement was submitted to the committee, which basically outlines my background.  I am a senior counsel practising at the Law Library in Dublin.  I also have an extensive career and knowledge behind me relating to the telecoms industry, covering 24 years at this stage.  I have been involved in various State bodies and operating groups through the years.  I was very much involved with a memorandum of understanding between the State agencies, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and Revenue in 2011 to try to make the current legislation work from a practical standpoint.  I need to correct my representation: I chair a trade association, the Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators, ALTO.  I am here with two hats on today.<br\/><br\/>I have put two submissions in writing to the committee.  The first was an independent submission really dealing with legal issues arising, which is a 13-page submission.  The second submission is a telco-specific submission.  The first submission is a broad submission that deals with strategic issues arising from the general scheme of the Bill.  Those strategic issues can be summarised in one sentence.  The scheme gives rise to very costly and burdensome obligations on the telecoms industry.  That is not to belittle the job of law enforcement and what this data retention amendment is designed to do.  It is very serious in relation to preservation of life and State security.  The third issue is what was challenged before the European Court of Justice, which was the investigation of offences.  In my submission I made observations on those.  The committee has seen them and I am happy to take questions on those particular issues<br\/><br\/>There are two other strands on the general observations.  The first relates to the issue of the Murray report and the very serious report that was put out in respect of the preservation of journalists' sources and the integrity of freedom of expression in Ireland.  That report must be considered in the context of this general scheme.  I am aware that other people who will give evidence today are dealing with that.  I have given the committee fairly extensive comments on it.  There was also a case that came to the Court of Appeal called Corcoran, wherein a warrant was issued relating to a journalist's mobile phone.  There was no latitude for an <i>inter-partes<\/i>, or two-way hearing, in respect of that issue.  Again, this is similar to the preservation of the right to freedom of expression and how that should operate in any future legislation that comes forward.<br\/><br\/>I conclude in my submission by dealing with the concerns around the administration of justice versus administrative tasks that judges may or may not do and the fact of supervision. I also talk about how the industry is likely to be subject to handling criminal offences very quickly if this legislation is passed at breakneck speed, which is what the proposal is.

I am very grateful to the committee for giving us the opportunity to talk to this issue, and particularly the remarkable haste with which this legislation is being put forward.<br\/><br\/>The old Yiddish definition of chutzpah is the man who kills both his parents and then pleads for mercy on the grounds that he is an orphan.  I am reminded of that when I look at how the Department of Justice has behaved in this, explaining that the Bill is so urgent it must evade normal democratic scrutiny.<br\/><br\/>It has been clear since 21 December 2016, when the European Court of Justice gave its judgment in the Tele2 case, that the Irish law on data retention is contrary to fundamental rights under European law.  In case there was any doubt about that, in April 2017 the former Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, delivered his report concluding exactly the same: that this was an illegal system of mass surveillance of virtually the entire population.  The report delivered an extensive list of ways in which the law violated basic standards under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.<br\/><br\/>Incredibly, we have had, essentially, no response to that from successive Ministers for Justice in the five years since then.  They did not do the responsible thing, which would have been to repeal the 2011 Act and put legislation in place that was rights' compliant.  Instead they persisted with, and effectively endorsed, the use of a clearly illegal power in a way that has stored up problems for subsequent prosecutions and - whatever the outcome of the Dwyer case, which itself is <i>sub judice<\/i>and which we will not comment on - will subsequently create difficulties for subsequent prosecutions.  They have fundamentally corroded the rule of law in that regard.<br\/><br\/>We received from the Department a heads of Bill published in 2017 but this was not a good faith response to either the Murray report or the Tele2 judgment.It failed to address very basic issues arising from that report and that judgment.  Digital Rights Ireland submitted during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the 2017 heads of the Bill that it failed on multiple grounds.  The predecessor to this committee accepted in its 2018 report that from start to finish, from the lack of notification of individuals who were affected by access, to the lack of protection for journalists&rsquo; sources, to the lack of independent effective judicial oversight, to the lack of an effective judicial remedy for abuse of the legislation, that the 2017 proposals simply failed to meet the Murray report or the Tele2 requirements.  Incredibly, that is still the case today.  These heads of Bill still fail to address, essentially, all of the core points arising from either Tele2 or the Murray report.<br\/><br\/>I regret that I have not had the opportunity to provide the committee with a more detailed submission on this.  I hope to get that later today if possible.  Fundamentally, it seems that this Bill is being rushed out with manufactured urgency in an attempt to sandbag any proper democratic scrutiny.  The extent to which the Data Protection Commission has not been consulted in relation to this, is in itself a distinct breach of European Union law, which requires that there would be prior consultation with the Data Protection Commission around measures of this sort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

I am very pleased to be able to assist the committee today in is pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Bill.<\/p> <p>  The timing of our contribution today is somewhat unusual given that the general scheme was published just eight days ago and the formal invite to appear before the committee issued only yesterday.  These timescales pose some challenges for the Data Protection Commission, DPC, in our role in assisting this committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny and also in our role in being mandatorily consulted by the Minister for Justice under the Data Protection Act 2018.<\/p> <p>  On foot of the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, judgment in April, the DPC was informed by the Department of Justice in June that a general scheme was in preparation as an interim amendment to the 2011 Data Retention Act, pending fuller scale reform.  The Department indicated that the DPC would be consulted and, in fact, the DPC received the general scheme just eight days ago.  We have not yet returned our detailed observations to the Department on the general scheme as we were advised last week by the Department that significant data protection-relevant updates to the scheme were being made, which would be reflected in the revised final version of the Bill.  The DPC has only received a copy of that updated Bill in the past 24 hours and we are now working diligently to prepare our detailed observations for the Department of Justice.<\/p> <p>  In the meantime, the DPC is very happy to share our preliminary observations on the general scheme, while acknowledging that some of what we comment on may already have been addressed in an updated version of the proposed Bill.  The DPC&rsquo;s remit relates to data protection-related rights and freedoms of individuals and our observations on the proposed Bill reflect the binding requirements in this regard set out by the CJEU.<\/p> <p>  Under the current 2011 Act, the main oversight and monitoring functions are reserved for the &ldquo;designated judge&rdquo; as set out in section 12 of that Act, namely to ascertain whether the agencies prescribed to make disclosure requests are complying with the Act.  However, the Act also provides that these judicial supervisory powers do not affect the functions of the Data Protection Commission.  In addition, the Act assigns a specific role to the DPC where it is designated as the national supervisory authority.  With these provisions in mind, some years ago the DPC conducted a number of audits to examine the designated bodies concerned and the telecommunications service providers.  The summary findings of those audits are available in the DPC annual reports of 2016 and 2017.<\/p><p>The general scheme clearly sets out to address the CJEU finding that mass and indiscriminate retention of electronic location and traffic data is not permitted for the purposes of combatting serious crime.  In making this finding, the CJEU set out a number of more permissible targeted retention measures that could be deployed, subject to specific safeguards and limitations by member states, for the purpose of fighting serious crime.<\/p><p> In that respect, head 5 provides for, subject to judicial authorisation and a transparency requirement to publish any order, the retention of Schedule 2 data, where an existing or foreseeable national security issue is in play.  It is the DPC's preliminary view that the arbitrary period of 12 months for retention is at odds with the CJEU's requirement for an assessment, in each case, of the period of time for which retention is actually necessary.<\/p><p> The CJEU has made it clear that derogations to the prohibition of storage of traffic and location data may only be granted for a period of time that is strictly necessary to achieve the objective pursued.  We also note the provisions that will allow bypassing of the advanced judicial authorisation in the context of requiring disclosure of such Schedule 2 data, as set out under head 9.  However, it is not clear how such purportedly urgent exceptions would, in the event, be justified.  Likewise, the means by which it will be clear a national security issue exists, or is foreseen, is not clear from the general scheme and further detail in this regard, would be of assistance to the DPC in our assessment of the measures.<\/p><p> Heads 12 to 15 give rise to some concerns, given the court has said that the limited and targeted retention it sees as permissible for serious crime investigation must not be turned into mass and indiscriminate retention.  In this regard, in respect of the specified bodies, themselves quite broad in range, which may access preservation or production orders for Schedule 2 data, the means by which objective targeting and limiting criteria will be established are not clear from the scheme.  With regard to justified urgent cases in heads 14 and 15, the apparent lack of judicial oversight after the event is also of concern.<\/p><p> In light of the high risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects inherent in the processing envisaged in the general scheme, the DPC is of the view that the Department should now conduct a data-protection impact assessment with regard to the processing and the provisions proposed.  The DPC also notes that there is no provision in the general scheme for the restriction of data subject rights.  Such rights include access rectification and erasure.  If restrictions are intended, we recommend that these should be provided for in the Bill, with a justification for why the restrictions are necessary and in what circumstances.<\/p><p> I hope to be of assistance to the committee and I am very happy to answer any questions members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1150,"content":"<p>I am here to represent the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  My role, as assistant commissioner, is in organised and serious crime.  Under that remit are sections such as the Criminal Asset Bureau, the fraud bureau, cybercrime, the Garda National Protective Service Bureau and the Garda Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.  I will, shortly, provide an overview of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's position on the Communications (Retention of Data) (Amendment) Bill 2022, which is focused on addressing the immediate impact of recent judgments from the CJEU, including in the Graham Dwyer case.  As the committee will be aware, in the Dwyer case, the CJEU ruled that EU law prohibited the general and indiscriminate retention of electronic and location data and found that in Ireland's case, section 6(1)(<i>a<\/i>) of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 was inconsistent with EU law.<br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomes the Communications (Retention of Data) (Amendment) Bill 2022.  We welcome the provision contained in same to seek and retain electronic traffic and location data, in order to mitigate risks posed to our national security.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also welcomes the provisions in the Bill to allow for the lawful access to subscriber data and information on Internet protocol IP addresses, which will be invaluable in sensitive criminal investigations.  It similarly acknowledges the provision in the Bill to access location information in high-risk missing persons cases, which allows us to meet our Article 2 obligations to preserve life.<br\/><br\/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na welcomes the fact that judicial authorisations will be required to preserve and access data and this, in turn, will provide reassurance to the public of the independence of the process and ensure the protections to the right to privacy and the right to protection of personal data.  Unfortunately, from the perspective of investigating serious crime, significant difficulties are foreseen.  We are, however, cognisant that the Bill has to conform to the jurisprudence of the CJEU.<br\/><br\/>Going forward, the issue of targeted retention is a challenge for all countries in the EU, not just Ireland.  It is acknowledged that the current Bill will be followed by additional legislation intended to address other outstanding issues.  As the committee will probably be aware, a significant feature of criminal investigations is the use of electronic traffic and location data to provide investigative opportunities to gather evidence.  In that regard, there is also a positive obligation on foot of the rulings of the superior courts in Ireland, which mandates An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek out and preserve all evidence which tends to show the guilt or innocence of persons suspected of involvement in a crime.<br\/><br\/>Under the scheme of the Bill, while An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be able to utilise preservation and production orders to secure evidence, this process will be forward looking and not retrospective.  This will cause significant difficulties in criminal investigations, which usually commence post-incident.  However, this restriction does not arise with regard to matters which relate to national security.<br\/><br\/>The Bill will be of most benefit where An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware in advance of communications methods utilised, for example, by an organised crime group.  Unfortunately, this is rarely the case.  In the norm, many of our criminal investigations look into the past and utilise post-incident analysis.  This will no longer be possible and will be a significant challenge for criminal investigations.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na urges wider consultation with the communication service providers in the initial period and post the enactment of the Bill, to examine the availability of data during this phase.<br\/><br\/>If any member of the committee has questions, my colleague and I are keen to assist.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Justin Kelly"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1151,"content":"<p>I have anticipated and share some of those concerns.

I am conscious of time.  The background of this is well known, so I will confine my remarks to noting what the most immediate impacts of the CJEU rulings are, as crystalised in the Graham Dwyer judgment of 5 April of this year.<\/p> <p>  We saw that there were three points.  The first was the confirmation that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of serious crime can no longer be permitted.  The second was the confirmation that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data is only permitted for national security purposes and not serious crime purposes.  The third main point of the CJEU's rulings was that access provisions for traffic and location data must incorporate prior judicial scrutiny, other than in certain urgent circumstances and, in such circumstances, there must be post-review.<\/p> <p>  In the view of the Department and the Minister, the law enforcement and national security concerns and operational risks arise on two fronts.  The first is where concerns have been raised by service providers, with the Department, with regard to the legal robustness of holding the data that are already retained under the existing 2011 Act, now that the CJEU has issued its final ruling in the Dwyer case.  The second is where serious concerns exist from the point of view of national security and the prosecution of serious offences, that a robust legal framework be in place for the retention and disclosure of communications data that supports these aims, while abiding by the constraints set down in the CJEU judgment.<\/p> <p>  Given the urgency of the matter, our Minister undertook to produce a draft general scheme which was published on 21 June.  That scheme provides for two main pillars of response.  The first pillar is the retention of traffic and location data and authorisation for disclosure of such data is for national security purposes.  This is a considerable change from the existing legal regime.  The first of those changes is that retention can only be for national security purposes and not for serious crime purposes.<\/p><p>The second big change is that both the retention decision and the access to that material can only be permitted on foot of independent authorisation by a judicial authority.  The second plank of the response includes preservation orders and production orders.  The committee will have received our material on that but the key distinguishing feature in terms of preservation orders is that they only require the data to be retained for a set period as authorised by a judge.  They do not entail access by the investigating agencies.  Production orders do indeed involve access to certain data but only data as specified in the application for the order.  Such orders can be for either serious crime or national security.  Those are the key features of the Bill.<\/p><p> I am conscious of time but the Chairman asked for clarification and I should address the gap between the published general scheme and what is pending in the Bill.  I apologise for the misunderstanding in that regard from my appearance last Monday.  This Bill is being developed in a truncated timeline.  Assuming it passes scrutiny, which, of course, I cannot assume, the Bill does include a number of further measures, most notably, one involving general retention of what is called IP source data.  These are data that, where the Garda investigation identifies unlawful online content, it can track back and see what IP address is linked to that content.  The Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, has been explicit that such a measure is permitted under its rulings, as has the European Parliament.  Again, however, it is intended that this will only be on foot of a judicial authorisation.  The theme of judicial authorisation, therefore, comes up again and again because that principle underlies much of the content of the Bill.  There are other provisions but we can deal with them in the question-and-answer slot.  I thank members for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1154,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelleher very much.  That concludes the opening statements.  To deal with Mr. Kelleher's last point now, I will make the point to the Department that on any Bill that comes before the committee when it is performing pre-legislative scrutiny or any other task, it is imperative that it has the very latest updated version, rather than performing scrutiny on an older version of legislation, which transpires not to be the one that is published after we scrutinise it.  That would be a key imperative.  I thank Mr. Kelleher for acknowledging that.  I have also spoken to the Minister about that because it is key.<\/p> <p>  We will move to questions.  Again, I mentioned at the outset that Mr. Lupton is under particular time pressures.  I appreciate all witnesses are here at short notice today.   I propose that rather than have a normal around the table session in which members indicate which witness they want to ask questions, we take Mr. Lupton's questions first because he has to be released to get into court.  I will do a quick two minute per member session for Mr. Lupton only at the outset.  He can then be freed to go about his business.   We will then take a second round with a wider gaze with rest of the panel if that works for everybody.  It might be a way to get the most out of everyone's time when people are under pressure.  Members may indicate to ask a question of Mr. Lupton only for the opening round.

I did not realise I was going to be first.  This is a very general question for Mr. Lupton.  He stated in his second submission:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIt is quite clear to me that robust laws will act as a disincentive to bad faith actors, and properly enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State Agencies ... Those robust laws must be compliant with the Constitution and Charter of Fundamental Rights, as interpreted through the various decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union. <\/blockquote> <p>In Mr Lupton's opinion, is this legislation in compliance with law?

My view is that we are currently operating a regime where the telecommunication companies are retaining data under the old legislation.  The idea with the general scheme is to build on top of that and triage, effectively, to allow law enforcement to do its job with the various flavours of solutions that have come from the Court of Justice of the European Union.<br\/><br\/>To the degree that solutions have been set out, Mr. Kelleher said the Department has gone about its job and is trying to faithfully do what is right within the ambit of what the judgment says.  However, Mr. Sunderland in his opening statement said there are problems regarding guidance as to how production and preservation orders will work.  That is a huge issue.  What are the impositions on the rights of the individual citizen in Ireland that may be affected by this that are not, in fact, subject to investigation?  That is another issue, which Dr. McIntyre dealt with.<br\/><br\/>There are, therefore, gaps and it is the speed by which the legislation has come out that caused those gaps.  However, I think the filling of those gaps has been dealt with effectively by the submissions before the committee to allow members to scrutinise and report on it.  Is it in compliance?  I would say we are probably approximately 70% of the way there but there are issues.  What I see as being one of the major issues is whether production orders, for example, that are done on an emergency basis can be reviewed <i>ex post<\/i>by a supervisory authority.  Currently, what goes on is not supervised by any individual judge or by any authority.  There is simply an application made for disclosure and the industry complies with that.  Therefore, that is out of compliance.<br\/><br\/>The other issue, which I think is important for the Garda, is that the legislation effectively contemplates a cliff.  In other words, once this is enacted, we change from 24-month telco retention to 12-month telco retention and there are no transitional measures to say what occurred with data in investigations that might be within the two-year window.  That exists in the 2011 framework so that is a problem.<br\/><br\/>Broadly speaking, we have more homework to do.  Is it fully compliant?  &quot;No&quot; is the answer.  Each of the witnesses has given their ten cent in terms of their area and what is in place.  I would say there are gaps, therefore, some of which I identified in the queries section of my first submission.

I make the point in my written submission that there is a requirement to assist law enforcement.

He mentioned in his opening statement a concern I have.  From my understanding of the proposed legislation, it includes the 90-day retention window that has been described in some correspondence as a fast freeze.  We are aware that in many of the more high-profile investigations, the suspect will not be identified until beyond 90 days, particularly in the case of mobile phone data.  I can think of at least two cases - there are probably multiple other such cases that may have received less attention - in which the suspect is not known to the investigating garda&iacute; or anyone else until after 90 days.  The data on Mr. X, who may be an innocent bystander, may be frozen on day one.  After 90 days expire, that person is exonerated, hopefully, but meanwhile Mr. Y, who was a culpable party and may be the murderer or wrongdoer has effectively escaped scot-free because the 90-day window did not start in time.

My next question is to Mr. Kelleher.  I put the same question to him at the meeting on Monday but I am afraid I must ask it again in public session.  It is a concern to the committee and to me, as Chairman, that the legislation was presented to us with only a couple of days to go prior to its enactment.  There was a pre-legislative scrutiny waiver request, which the committee refused and, hence, we are here today.  I am thankful to everybody in the room for making this happen.<\/p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. Kelleher stated that the Government approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill on 31 May.  We know the data retention directive was annulled in 2014, arising from the 2011 legislation.  We know that in January 2019, a decision of the High Court led to an appeal relating to the legislation.  We know a preliminary opinion was delivered a year ago and the final, official opinion of the European Court of Justice came in April.  Despite all of that, it was not until 31 May, some two months after the final decision, that we got approval to start drafting legislation.  It strikes me that we would not be in this sort of whirlwind, end-of-term race to get this over the line had we started at any stage prior to that.  As some of the witnesses suggested in their opening statements, the information has been out there for some time.  I have outlined the timeline and others made the point that the need for action was not unexpected.  How are we in a situation in which we are dealing with the legislation in this manner?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#F00600","speaker":"1583"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1187,"content":"<p>As the Chairman noted, he and I engaged on this point the other day.  For the benefit of everyone, I will try to recap our response as best as I can.  The view in the Department, sanctioned by the Ministers of the day, was that this was an area of the law that was continuing to evolve and we had to see how the case law would evolve.  As the Chairman and some of the witnesses rightly said, it has been evolving for quite a few years.<\/p> <p>  Internal legal advice has been obtained at every stage.  The most significant recent development probably was the judgment in 2016.  A year later, as some of the witnesses mentioned, a general scheme was published by the former Minister, Deputy Flanagan.  Drafting work was carried out on that scheme.  I can only honestly, in transparency, advise the committee that a judgment call was made while that general scheme was progressing - it went up to a ninth draft, as we call it in the drafting trade, under the Parliamentary Counsel - that it would be unwise to publish that Bill when the ongoing litigation in the case we alluded to earlier was ongoing in the High Court, then the Supreme Court and then the European Court of Justice.<\/p> <p>  If anyone were to read the Supreme Court's referral of the Dwyer case to the European Court of Justice, it is very illustrative of the complexities of this area.  Clearly, if the Supreme Court felt the law was sufficiently settled, it would not have felt the need to refer the case to the European Court of Justice.  It would simply have drawn down the case law based on its expertise and applied that in the Dwyer case.  When one reads the Supreme Court referral, one sees a particularly important fact highlighted, which is that the Dwyer case was the first case the court was aware of in which expert witness evidence was obtained from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, as I understand it, from a telecommunications industry analyst.  Obviously, it was a case with the most graphic of circumstances imaginable.  The court felt these factors needed to be considered by the European Court of Justice.<\/p> <p>  There is another factor, which is that there was a judgment, which I alluded to in my appearance before the committee earlier in the week, called La Quadrature du Net, of October 2020.  That was the first case in which the European Court of Justice acknowledged at all that there could even be general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data.  As members will be aware, however, the court made a very clear distinction as to general and indiscriminate retention of data for national and state security reasons, allowing for that in certain circumstances, which we did not know before.  If we had legislated prior to then, that opportunity would not have been there.  The court went on to say there could not be general and indiscriminate retention of data for the investigation of serious crime purposes.  In both the La Quadrature du Net judgment of October 2020 and the Dwyer judgment of April this year, the court went on to explain further the other countermeasures that may be taken and will go some way towards mitigating the loss of general and indiscriminate retention of data.  In the case of the accelerated or expedited retention of data in individual cases, which the Chairman correctly mentioned, the court explained and fleshed out its thinking in this regard in both the La Quadrature du Net and the Dwyer judgments.<\/p> <p>  I probably am going on too long about this.  There has been a lot going on in this space.  The decision that has been made internally at my end is that we need to legislate now because, at a very minimum, we need to start the clock running again on lawful retention of data in order that national security requirements and law enforcement requirements can recommence, as it were, in regard to accessing data lawfully.  One of the witnesses mentioned the lack of transitional provisions in the Bill.  That is a matter on which we remain in contact with the Attorney General.  It is one of the matters we were not able to box off in the scheme of the Bill as approved by the Government during the week.  It is one of the supplementary issues that will be addressed in the Bill as published.<\/p><p>I should mention the other issues that, unfortunately, I did not allude to in my presentation earlier, that are in the Bill to be published.  They include extensive provisions for statutory guidance on how all of these provisions will operate in the form of secondary legislation.  The secondary legislation is issued to the Oireachtas for 21 days and it can accept it or revoke it.  That is probably too long an answer.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#F00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Kelleher","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1189,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kelleher.

Probably one of the ways to deal with this is to look at scenarios.  We all remember the Joe O'Reilly case in north County Dublin.  His wife was murdered, and CCTV and telecommunications were part of the method that was used at that time to investigate the case.  If a similar situation arises after this legislation comes in, a victim is found somewhere and the Garda has identified a potential suspect or perhaps more than one, in that case, can they go to a judge and seek to get telecommunications data to identify the movement of the person using existing technology or does it have to be an issue relating to State security?

I do not want to discuss the particular case the Deputy mentions, but he is correct that, in general for a homicide case, we could not go backwards and retrieve the data unless there was a national security element to it.  As I said in my opening remarks, that would be a difficulty for us but phone analysis would be one element of a major investigation and we would obviously have all the other elements open to us.

It is very difficult to prescribe specific scenarios, but if we could just take it back to first principles, the general and indiscriminate retention of data in the future will only be for a national security purpose.  The data will be in a box, as it were, and to get into the box we must be able to show that there is a national security angle to the request.  Let us assume that if we go into the box for a national security reason and when we get the data we have indicators of criminal activity, we cannot un-ring the bell.  We have seen the information and I suspect that we would have to go off and do a separate investigation, but we cannot forget that we have come across that information.  Were we to have sought that information in the first place for a law enforcement reason, we would not have received the information.<\/p> <p>  The second plank of my reply relates to what Deputy Kenny asked could be done if online child abuse material was discovered.

We have been made aware that it is a particularly important power for the investigation of online child abuse scenarios.  This is complex, so that is the best answer I can give at this moment in time.<\/p> <p>  The final point I would make is that if information is initially being sought for a criminal investigation purpose, in the guise of what we call a preservation order or production order, for law enforcement, those orders will be forward going in time because we cannot get around the fact that general retention is for national security purposes only.<\/p> <p>  I will make a very quick reference for the aid of the committee.  In the Dwyer judgment online in the CJEU, I think it is paragraph 90 to 100 of the judgment, the Danish Government asked the CJEU if it could make use of information it had obtained for a national security purpose for another law enforcement purpose and, unfortunately, from my Department's perspective, the CJEU said it could not because that would undermine the rationale that we are only retaining it in the first place for a national security purpose.  It is quite a challenging set of drafting instructions that we are dealing with at the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#G01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dan Kelleher"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1198,"content":"<p>It certainly is.

I will make an observation and ask three questions.<\/p> <p>  The observation is as follows.  In response to the Chair's question to Mr. Kelleher, I think, having been here a long time, that Departments sometimes feel they are the legislators and we are here simply to rubber stamp.  An evolving situation should involve us, as the Oireachtas, and the general public, so we are all party to the development of something that will impact on every citizen's life.  It is an invidious situation that, at the end of a long process involving nine drafts of a Bill that nobody here ever saw, we are expected, as the Legislature, to simply accept all the complexities of the evolution.  I hope, in general terms, we might have better engagement from an earlier stage in these things.<\/p> <p>  It goes to the point Deputy Costello made.  Our concern is to make sure we have robust legislation enacted that gets the balance right between European Court-mandated rights of citizens and ensuring the garda&iacute; have the best possible capacity to fight crime.  We do not want a serious investigation to be undermined at some future date by a repetition of a court case.  That would be very worrying.<\/p> <p>  On the requirement for consultation with the DPC, the deputy commissioner has said he received the general scheme eight days ago and the updated Bill 24 hours ago.  Does Mr. Kelleher think that is adequate?  That is my first question.  I have a related question on complying with Article 35 of the general directive on data protection.  There is a requirement under that for a data protection impact assessment.  Has that been complied with in the presentation of this Bill?<\/p> <p>  My third question relates to a question asked previously.  Overarching legislation is being developed which will be more intricate and complex.  Is it Mr. Kelleher's view that it would be appropriate, in these circumstances and given all the concerns raised by the people who have given submissions to us to date, that this legislation should have a sunset clause enacted and be overtaken by the more comprehensive legislation when we have time to introduce it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#H00800","speaker":"1620"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1656543600,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>Deputy Martin Kenny took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656543600,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>On the consultation with the DPC, I will give a straight answer to a straight question.

In any event, take it as read that it is there.  I know what a data protection impact assessment is.  It is clearly prescribed in the Data Protection Act 2018 and the GDPR.

What type of offence would this be?  Would it involve a five-year definition as well?  Is it proposed that this will be in the eventual Bill?  I ask because there is no reference to a serious offence in the context of this proposed change.<\/p><p> My other question is for Assistant Commissioner Kelly, who believes wider consultation is necessary.  Who does he think that wider consultation should be with?  Can he think of any specific types of cases in this regard?  He mentioned tiger kidnappings and child abduction.

There were two planks to the Deputy&rsquo;s questions to me.  As I understand it, the first aspect concerned whether there is a modification of the legal definition of \"a serious offence&rdquo; in the 2011 Act.  As will be recalled, we are not replacing this Act, but doing running repairs to it and adding elements where we think it necessary.  No change is proposed to the legal definition of \"a serious crime\" in this proposed draft amending Bill.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the second aspect concerning the Deputy&rsquo;s query about the grade of Garda officer who can seek disclosure in the context of the new section 6(1)(a), which I think the Deputy mentioned, that refers to \" A member ... not below the rank of Inspector\", this is a policy drafting decision we have made.  We have put in the phrase &ldquo;not below the rank of Inspector&rdquo;, and that is a floor and not a ceiling.  It will be a matter for the Garda authorities to determine how they wish to pitch that operationally.  When I was dealing with and engaging on this question the other day, I also mentioned that part of the thinking behind it - and it is not in this provision, which deals with subscriber data, but it is there for the other category of data, which is traffic and location data - was that it is not the inspector making the decision to access traffic and location data.  He or she is authorised to ask the court to permit access to the traffic and location data.  This is what drove the decision to put in the phrase &ldquo;not below the rank of Inspector&rdquo;.

A point of information had arisen which was of great concern.  I can advise the meeting that it has been addressed.  I spoke to the Government Chief Whip and the clerk has spoken to the Bills Office to be sure to be sure.  A concern was raised very legitimately, and it was of significant concern to the committee, that the Bill might have been out the gap, so to speak, and had been published.  However, I am told that it has not been published and will not be published until we have completed our scrutiny which was planned for today.  The intended timeline is that the Bill would be published tomorrow or possibly late this evening but that there would be a reasonable time for amendments to be tabled.  A reasonable period is not defined but I take it to be a minimum of 24 hours.  I also understand that the Ceann Comhairle has discretion to allow windows.  I am told that we will not end up in a situation where amendments are closed before the meeting has concluded.  There will be a period following the meeting in which amendments can be tabled.

If we are going to quote the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case and Supreme Court judgments, we should all have concern - in the words of Chief Justice &Oacute; D&aacute;laigh - for the contingencies of &quot;an improbable but not-to-be-overlooked future&quot;.  I came across those words in Mr. Justice Hardiman's decision in DPP <i>v<\/i>. JC.  His introduction to that judgment is very apt now.  He was concerned about the <i>force publique<\/i>and the need to actively protect fundamental freedoms.  That is ultimately the background to what we are considering today.  The legislation was struck down on the grounds that it did not sit with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  That is the context within which the Bill should be considered and weighed in the balance.  Like others, I also have concerns about the process, but I will skip over those briefly.<\/p><p>I will pick out some general themes on the basis of what the witnesses have stated.  Several of them mentioned the protection of sources, judicial authorisation and oversight and independent oversight.  I am concerned that we are not living up to the importance of protecting those fundamental rights of EU citizens.  We could end up - partly because of the rushed legislation and the failure to recognise these issues - in the same situation where this and even the next legislation will be thrown out, possibly in the context of a horrendous case, invalidating a swathe of criminal investigations.  Good work by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be thrown out because of these procedural failings.<\/p><p>By way of another general observation, much reference is made about senior Garda officers being able to issue their own warrants and approve their own search requests.  While we are focused on senior officers, I have voiced concern about that in other pre-legislative scrutiny debates, so I feel I should say it again here.<\/p><p>What do Mr. McIntyre and the DPC consider to be the effect of the mandatory consultation periods and the lack of a data protection impact assessment, DPIA?  How much of a legal frailty does it introduce and could the legislation be left open to challenge?  We are rushing this proposed legislation.  It is complex in terms of its subject matter and needs to be taken slowly so that we do not get it wrong.  Rushed legislation has a habit of being wrong.  We have these two risks combined, which is quite concerning.  Are we introducing a fatal legal frailty into the proposed Bill?<\/p><p>Mr. Kelleher spoke about the background to the general scheme.  The timeline in his submission seems to start quite late.  It does not mention the Tele2 case, the Digital Rights Ireland case or the Murray report.  It does not really mention the previous pre-legislative scrutiny.  Why were the issues raised in the Murray report and the previous pre-legislative scrutiny ignored when drafting the Bill?<\/p><p>One of my concerns might be addressed by the assistant Garda commissioner.  While I have spoken generally about restraining the <i>force publique<\/i>- to quote Mr. Justice Hardiman again - I am conscious of the Blazejewicz case, which involves Garda access to web data.  I appreciate that this is an ongoing case, so I will not say more.  There was a previous case involving a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na using surveillance technology to trace and check in on a former partner.  We have seen the treatment of whistleblowers and journalist sources.  In light of the new and extensive powers garda&iacute; will get without independent oversight or the possibility of an<i>ex post facto<\/i>review, as raised by others, is the assistant Garda commissioner happy that there is ample internal oversight to prevent abuse of these powers by individual garda&iacute;?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#M00600","speaker":"1570"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1269,"content":"<p>Deputy Costello has taken up with time with questions, but I will allow time for answers because they directed at a few people.

In addition, it requires prior consultation with the DPC under Article 36.  On top of that, there are extra obligations under the law enforcement directive that was implemented into Irish law by section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018, which also requires prior consultation.  As we have seen, none of these requirements have been met and in fact Digital Rights Ireland has already written to the DPC about that.<\/p> <p>  I turn to a second point touched on by Deputy Costello, and raised previously by Deputy Pringle, regarding the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case principle and the issues this legislation raises in that regard.  Committee members will recall that the Sinn F&eacute;in funds case concerned the question of interference by the Legislature in ongoing civil litigation and the extent to which that was permissible.  In this context, Digital Rights Ireland is the party to some of that litigation.  Therefore, I will not say much about this case, except to note that it is very unlikely that this legislation will retrospectively legitimise the retention of data that has already been retained.  That ship sailed quite some time ago.  It will be very unlikely, be it in the context of litigation such as the Digital Rights Ireland case or future challenges to the admissibility of criminal legislation, that the adoption of this legislation will retrospectively validate what happened before it.  In that sense, one can take it that such a problem cannot be retrospectively fixed.  This point was expressly made by the European Court of Justice in the Dwyer case, which stated that member states cannot limit the retrospective effect of findings of illegality under European law.  If one tried to apply what is being proposed retrospectively, one would be doing it in a way that would contravene the principle outlined in the Dwyer case.  Hopefully that answered Deputy Costello's question as it was addressed to me.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#M00800","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

What is important for us in the DPC is that we complete our substantive review, which we are doing as a matter of urgency on the revised text of the Bill.  We hope to be in a position to provide substantive observations to the Department very shortly.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Costello's question on internal oversight of the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p> The DPC conducted a number of audits a number of years ago in respect of the operation of the 2011 Act.  We concluded that the strict assessment criteria were deployed by centralised liaison units in each of the State agencies and, in particular, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We noted the attention given by the liaison units, when working with the investigation units on the ground, to ensure that the scope of disclosure requests were narrowed down and refined to the minimum at all times.  Our audit team found that the principles of proportionality in assessing relevance were applied in all of the disclosure requests examined and, in all cases, were reviewed, signed and approved at the required level on a case-by-case basis.  That was in the context of the 2011 Act.  Of course, things have changed as regards the broader principles around what the Court of Justice of the EU has stated regarding retention of data.  If it gives the Deputy any comfort, the DPC's assessment at the time was that the internal operations and processes within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were working properly.<\/p><p> I welcome what departmental officials have said about the implementation of statutory instruments to regulate or to provide guidance on how this new Act should function.  That will be absolutely essential.  There will be a requirement for each of the bodies involved and associated with operating the Act to look again at all their procedures to ensure that, even from a first principles data protection point of view, all the necessary safeguards are implemented, and especially that principles are being adhered to.<\/p><p> The audit reports I referred to are summarised in our 2016 and 2017 annual reports, which we can provide to the committee if that is helpful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#M01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Dale Sunderland","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>Deputy Costello's time is up, but I will allow his questions to be completed.

The Deputy raised the issue of obtaining data relating to national security where there is a case of urgency.  There are also significant safeguards relating to that.  A data request has to come from a superior officer who is a member at superintendent level or above and there are quite a narrow set of terms.  There has to an imminent threat to State security or a threat to destroy data.  In addition, when that is invoked, that superior officer must make a report on it to an officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who is not below the rank of assistant commissioner.  That superior officer must also make a report to the authorising judge.

It would make my job a great deal easier if the measures in this proposed Bill went much further, or were eliminated entirely, so there was none of the data retention the State is asking for.  Having said that, I have a different role when I sit in this chair.  As was referred to earlier, we have to look at the protection of the security of the State.  We could spend all day looking at potential misuse, for example.  That question has been answered by the assistant commissioner and the DPC representatives.  Of course, people can abuse their powers but it is unlawful to do so.  That is a matter of putting structures in place to ensure people are not able to do that.  In a personal capacity, I have many issues with PULSE, the information that is retained on it and, often, its accuracy, but that is not the subject of this proposed Bill.  It may be a discussion for another day.  What is very important are the structures that are maintained in place to ensure that people do not abuse their position.  We cannot approach the general scheme with one eye on how things might be done illegally.  We have to look at the framework of legal activity and whether it is proportionate in the context of what is required.<\/p> <p>  I agree with contributors who have criticised the lack of notice rather than the swiftness.  I do not think swiftness is a problem.  In fact, more swiftness would generally be a good thing for the way we do business throughout the State.  There is a difficulty, however, with the lack of notice that has been afforded to members.  I say that as a Member of the Seanad, which will see this proposed Bill after the D&aacute;il has finished with it, so we will get even less notice and less opportunity, in many respects, to have our say on it.  I see that as problematic.  I am frequently critical of the notion of Bills coming before the Houses in a very swift fashion without the requisite notice.<\/p> <p>  I have some concerns about the suggestion Deputy Pringle made that somehow the swiftness of this calls into question the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  Ultimately, the place to amend the eventual Bill is in the D&aacute;il and Seanad.   There will be an opportunity for Members of both Houses to do that.  This has been a fairly robust discussion.  People have had a chance to validly criticise the aspects of the proposed Bill about which they have concerns.  I do not have any doubts about the validity or efficacy of this process.  It is very important the Department hears what has been said here and takes it on board.  It is also important to remember the Department can hear what is said here, take it on board and disagree with it.  That is also a legitimate approach for the Department to take, however unhappy we might be about aspects of that.<\/p> <p>  This is a standard thing I say about all legislation; amending legislation is a bad way to start.  For any citizen coming to read what these heads of Bill will become, it is impenetrable.  When someone opens the first page and sees there are 20-odd sections amending an Act that is not present in this proposed Bill, it is very difficult for ordinary citizens, and those of us who are lawyers, to penetrate what is actually in the legislation.  I very much favour the idea that we repeal and consolidate legislation before we amend.  It is a much more straightforward way of allowing people to access what the law states.<\/p> <p>  All of that said, and taking cognisance of all the criticisms that have been made, I also recognise the two major obligations of the Department in this regard.  The first is to protect us all and to protect the security of the State.  I do not have a difficulty with the lack of a definition of \"security of the State\" because it is not defined in many other of the Acts that use the term and which have been approved by the courts in many challenges.  I do not have a difficulty with that.  In fact, to define the term \"security of the State\" is to invite problems from my colleagues in the Law Library, who will see a term and decide to pick it apart in a way it was never intended to be.  I do not have a difficulty with that term, although I understand where Deputy Pringle is coming from.  Of course, we should have clarity on what this term means but it is also important there be an opportunity for it to be parsed on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate.  I am happy for the courts to take a responsible view when applying that.<\/p> <p>  It is also incredibly important to apply the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in the Dwyer case.  It would be remiss to do otherwise.  For that reason, it is entirely appropriate that the Department has reacted swiftly.  However uncomfortable I or any other member might be with the contents of this proposed Bill, we all have to agree that it is necessary.  It is something we should be moving on and seeking to amend, if that is what we want to do, as it goes through both Houses after this committee's scrutiny.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#N00600","speaker":"1685"},{"type":"speech","time":1656543600,"counter":1279,"content":"<p>I completely agree with repealing and consolidating legislation.

I want to elaborate on some points in that regard.  Some members spoke about particular aspects such as authorisation, oversight and the lack of any definition of national security, which is, incidentally, required by the European Court of Human Rights.  In the case of Zakharov <i>v<\/i>. Russia, it is made clear that surveillance measures must be associated with a definition of national security so that the circumstances in which surveillance measures may be used is foreseeable.  While members referred to individual aspects of the Murray report that are not reflected in this legislation, rather than look at the details, it may be useful to step back a little bit and consider the overall position.  The Murray report made in excess of 50 individual recommendations as to changes to the existing scheme which were necessary for compliance with European fundamental rights standards.  These were not changes that were nice to have or just desirable but changes the former Chief Justice saw as essential.  By my count, only one of these recommendations has been met in this proposal, that is, the adoption of independent judicial authorisation for access to data.  No other recommendation has been addressed.  Similarly, judging from a quick scan of the report of this committee's predecessor from 2018 in the limited time available, again, only the requirement for independent judicial authorisation has been addressed.  As other speakers have already pointed out, there has been no attempt to address subsequent developments such as the very recent judgment of the Court of Appeal requiring additional protection for access to journalists' sources.  Ultimately, it seems there is a fundamental disrespect on the part of the Department for the work done by the predecessor to this committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny and for the work of the former Chief Justice.  To my mind, no legislation in this area should be adopted without these recommendations and the essential requirements that have been identified being taken into account.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022063000002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. T.J.

It is accepted that this is not everything that needs to be done in this area and we do not present it as such.  As we see it, this is an urgent Bill that seeks to put retention of data on a more secure legal footing.
