We will, therefore, transact the business of the committee this morning and examine the Department's appropriation accounts at 1.30 p.m. with the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.<\/p> <p>  The public business before us this morning is as follows: minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business, AOB.  We will then briefly go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters before suspending until 1.30 p.m.<\/p> <p>  The first item is the minutes for the meeting of 23 June which have been circulated to members.  Does any member wish to raise matters in relation to those minutes?  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.

The area I wanted to draw attention to is on page 6 of the reply.<\/p><p>That is to do with where people pay more than the due toll at the collection point.  The toll roads include the M1, M3, M6 and M7.  It is a relatively small amount but the companies can keep those relatively small amounts as revenue.  They say they put it back into road maintenance.<\/p><p> I inquired about this and received a reply from the Minister for Transport.  This relates to two toll facilities in particular - the Dublin tunnel and one other.  In 2019, a sizeable amount was overpaid.  That reduced in 2020, which I think was down to level of usage, but continued lower in 2021.  That was probably to do with contactless payment and people using tags.  The figure has been rounded up in some cases to &euro;2 rather than &euro;1.90 and it is a round figure.  That is probably the reason but it is still a sizeable amount that the toll operators get to keep.<\/p><p> They have said this goes back into maintenance but they are not due that money and the way it is treated is a concern for me.  It is just treated as their income.  We all know local shops routinely get a knock on the door to help with funding jerseys for a local football team but nobody thinks to knock on the door of the toll road companies when they get a sizeable amount that is not earned income.<\/p><p> The only comparison I can make is with Dublin Bus where it ceased giving people refunds because only approximately 10% of people ever went to get the refund where they made an overpayment.  Instead, the company put in place a programme of grants for the people in the catchment who would be customers of Dublin Bus.  That scheme of grants allows people or groups to make an application for aid.  It is a fair process, although it has not been much of a feature in the past couple of years for obvious reasons.  Each area benefits from that.  I have said it before that such a process would be more appropriate than the toll companies pocketing the money.  I have no confidence they are spending over and above what they say they are on maintenance.  It is not income they have earned but it comes directly from people's pockets when it should go back to something different.<\/p><p> That is the point I wanted to make.  All these companies will have received more than the due toll and some have received considerably more than the toll.  It would make a sizeable difference to people in communities.  We all know how difficult it is to keep community groups going.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#A02700","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":29,"content":"<p>The figure for 2019 jumps out at &euro;44.9 million.

I have a concern in respect of how roads are being allocated funding and the criteria used.  I have raised the N2 road scheme from Clontibret to the Border, which is in my constituency but part of a much larger project that would increase connectivity to the north west, particularly counties Donegal and Derry.  It has been the subject of numerous Government policies and it is in the national development plan, as all these types of road projects are.  It has also been part of several peace process negotiations and included in Our Rural Future: Rural Development Policy 2021-2025 and other Government strategies.  Nevertheless, on a whim, the funding for the next phase has just been withdrawn.<\/p> <p>  We are told Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, makes these decisions based on some form of independent criteria but within this correspondence it confirms that consideration of allocation for future years is subject to review by the Department and any directions of the Minister.  There must be further review of the matter.  The main criteria under which the projects are assessed include safety, and the project in question has, quite rightly, been rated as highly positive in the impact it would have.  That is not surprising, considering that just last Friday there was another accident in the village of Emyvale, which this road would bypass.<\/p> <p>  On the criterion of economy the project has been rated as neutral.  This suggests the road is being taken on a stand-alone basis as opposed to the critical wider N2 and A5 connectivity link between the north west and Dublin.  All of this must be revisited.  It would be useful if we could ask in the first instance if TII's original proposal included allocation of the funds for 2022 for this road or if the proposal suggested this would be removed.  That would be useful.  In essence, we must find out who is stalling this road.<\/p> <p>  We know how it can be revisited because TII has told us that it happens via ministerial direction.  Government representatives could get their act together and fight for it, as they have done in other parts of the country.  What was the sequence of events that led to it being put on hold in the first place?

We would find it is way in excess of what the EU allows and, therefore, we are paying fines.  We could ask the question of what fines have been paid on foot of the Dublin Port tunnel toll barrier.  We are creating NOx emissions traps, and that is apart from anything related to the cost of living.<\/p><p>We cannot discount the fact that when a truck stops, the torque required for the truck to take off costs &euro;1.

All over the world, there are tolled tunnels that do not use an actual barrier.  We need to invest in that technology.

It provides useful objective information.  We have corresponded with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications on the matter.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.<\/p> <p>  We raised this question with departmental officials when they appeared before the committee.  Many of the vehicles being purchased were very large ones, including Range Rover, BMW and Mercedes vehicles, with most of them being bought in the greater Dublin area.  One could draw the conclusion that they were not doing very long journeys whereas the people down the country who are travelling longer distances in diesel or petrol cars could not afford to purchase electric vehicles.  The explanation here is peculiar.  It confirms that financial support for electric vehicles is regressive and tends to benefit those at the higher end of the income distribution.  We should ask the Department why we continue with the grant system we have if it acknowledges that is the case.<\/p> <p>  Since the introduction of the EV grant, 27,546 vehicles have been supported at a cost of &euro;130 million, which is a substantial amount of money.  There is also &euro;166 million forgone in VRT.  Altogether, that is almost &euro;300 million and much of that is being spent supporting people to purchase very large vehicles.  Do people spending &euro;80,000 or &euro;100,000 on an enormous SUV really need the EV grant?  The committee should question departmental officials when they also acknowledge it is regressive.  Is it agreed that we correspond with the Department on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#D00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":82,"content":"<p>A number of committees need to look at this issue.  From the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts, there is a value-for-money issue here.  The international evidence is clear: without grant support, electric vehicles will not be purchased to a great degree.  When Denmark started to withdraw grants, the sales immediately dropped.  It is a given.  We need to see increased use of EVs and we need a grant scheme that supports their use.  My difficulty with the current grant scheme - the figures bear this out - is that it is disproportionately used by wealthier people living in areas with public transport as opposed to the very people we should be incentivising, those who live in areas without electric vehicles.  The irony is that they are subsidising the new cars through being forced to pay carbon tax because they have no choice other than to drive diesel or petrol cars.  There is an inherent unfairness.<\/p> <p>  It does not make sense to pay out so much in grants to private individuals while we still have tens of thousands of vehicles owned by public bodies which are not EVs.  Many local authority vehicles are not EVs, yet we are giving grants to private individuals.  We still have Garda vehicles that are not EVs.  We cannot just say that this is how it works and this is how we will operate.  We certainly cannot take the position of the SEAI that in the long term poorer people who are currently being penalised will be able to buy second-hand vehicles from the people who got the grants for the new cars.  That appears to be the long-term strategy.  That is inherently unfair and not achieving what we need from an environmental point of view.  I agree with the Chairman that this needs to be analysed before we end up spending &euro;1 billion on EV grants while doing little to reduce transport emissions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#D00600","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>There are a few issues there to point out to the Department.  Between VRT foregone and the direct grant, it is costing &euro;300 million.  As Deputy Carthy said, in a year or two &euro;1 billion might have been spent.  The scheme needs to be refined because it is clear it is not achieving its original objective.  Previous information the Department supplied indicated there is now a cap on the value of a new vehicle of &euro;60,000.  A vehicle costing more than &euro;60,000 does not qualify for the grant, which helps.  As I recall it, when the Secretary General appeared before the committee, I put it to him that it should be reduced further.  We should not be subsidising large vehicles.  The people who are not benefiting are the very people who are paying the bulk of the carbon tax, have to drive the longest distances and do not have public transport.  We will point that out to the Department in terms of public expenditure.<\/p> <p>  No. 1315 is from Mr. Tom Boland, chairman of Benefacts, dated 17 June 2022.  Having reviewed the committee&rsquo;s correspondence with Departments and State agencies, which we have published, Mr. Boland states that he has written to the committee to correct the record on correspondence we have received from the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Rural and Community Development on the closure of the Benefacts database.  Mr. Boland contests a number of statements made by the Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s statement that it &ldquo;does not intend to establish a similar database, as it has no business need for one (it is not in itself a user of Benefacts&rsquo; services).&rdquo;  Mr. Boland states that in 2018 Benefacts was contacted by the pay and pensions unit of the Department and asked to provide a detailed analysis of the pay, pensions and PRSI profile of all non-profit organisations receiving funding from any State source, and that in 2021 an updated version of these data sets was requested by the Department. <\/p> <p>  The Department of Rural and Community Development&rsquo;s statement that it &ldquo;never had a funding relationship with Benefacts&rdquo; is also contested.  Mr. Boland states that at the request of that Department&rsquo;s social enterprise unit, Benefacts was funded to produce a detailed data set to assist officials in identifying non-profit organisations that might be capable of being recognised by the Department as social enterprises.  There are a number of other contested statements.<\/p> <p>  As well as our correspondence with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we included the closure of Benefacts on the agenda for our meeting with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 19 May this year.  Some members have expressed concern over the termination of the database, given that it is reported that it provided oversight of about &euro;7 billion of public funds that goes to the non-profit sector each year.  The correspondence we received from the Central Statistics Office, No. R1246, on the closure of the database gave rise to further concerns.<\/p><p>It stated that the data it received free of charge from Benefacts was a valuable data source for the CSO across a range of areas and \"helped the CSO fulfil important statistical reporting required under EU legislation\".  In the absence of the Benefacts database, the CSO states that it will need investment across a number of areas.<\/p><p> We have requested sight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's business case for, and the value for money review of, the Benefacts database.  We have also brought the matter and the CSO's correspondence to the attention of the Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform.

It is quite a useful and comprehensive letter that raises a number of issues.  The number one issue is value for money.  Some &euro;6.3 million of public money was invested in this database and &euro;250,000 was spent on shutting it down.  There will also be a cost for the CSO, which we can see.  It may be useful to write to the CSO, or the relevant Department, to find out exactly what the nature of the investment would be to allow it to fulfil the EUROSTAT requirements under EU law.<\/p> <p>  Additional money is now being spent on the Department of Rural and Community Development to scope out the creation of a database that would be more limited than that of Benefacts, but that would be an additional cost.  There are serious value for money issues here.  The Indecon report indicated a number of issues that have been referred to, including if it was a question of Benefacts being superseded by another entity, there would be a requirement to have some sort of interim arrangement so we do not have a loss of the information that has been captured in that database, which was used by State and individual organisations.  Many people used this database.  It included audited figures, it was reliable and it was open source.<\/p> <p>  There has been a lot of misinformation.  I was quite shocked by what we were told on that particular day, before the database was closed down.  I asked the Secretary General if he had read the Indecon report.  He told me he had not but that he had been briefed on it.  We probably all have a copy of the Indecon report.  It is not a difficult document to read; neither is its executive summary.  It well summarises some of the issues.  It states that, when it comes to a cost-benefit analysis, the benefits of the database outweigh the costs, which is not what we are being told.  It really annoys me that we are not getting accurate information.<\/p> <p>  I raised this matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who took Leaders' Questions.  It is important we note how Benefacts was set up. According to page 2 of the document before me, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's conditions for providing funding include that Benefacts was incorporated as a not-for-profit company; it was limited by guarantee without share capital at the Department's behest, which reflected the public benefit purposes for which it was established; and this meant that the company had no beneficial owners in the commercial sense and that, unlike a for-profit enterprise, was unable to make any medium- or long-term plans based on equity or borrowings.  In his reply to me yesterday, the Minister said that none of the Departments had an interest in contributing towards the funding of this, but he also said they could have raised money from other sources.  There was philanthropy involved in setting Benefacts up but the way the company is structured means it is not open to it to raise money in the way a normal enterprise would.  That was at that Department's own behest.<\/p> <p>  I question why this was shut down.  There was a significant volume of publicly available information.  Sometimes funding comes from multiple sources.  It was very valuable to be able to capture the range of sources of funding.  The more limited thing being talked about by the Department of Rural and Community Affairs does not have that broad look.  We are fixated on the silo-based approach.  Benefacts was the opposite of that.  It took an overview.  That was incredibly valuable.  It is not something that can be captured in value for money terms, but there are aspects of value for money that can be captured.<\/p> <p>  The thing about the Charities Regulator that was repeatedly referred to during committee meetings is disputed in the correspondence.  I would believe what Benefacts is disputing because of the timelines.  The relevant legislation dates to 2009 and the Charities Regulator was set up in 2014 around the same time as Benefacts started.  Benefacts had proof of concept when this proposal was put.  Several things are disputed throughout this document.  It is very thoughtful correspondence, but I feel there was a decision to close Benefacts down even before the Indecon report was commissioned.  I cannot see why we would want to end up with a less transparent arrangement relating to public funding that will cost more.  This is something we should not let go. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#E00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":86,"content":"<p>It is curious.  What I found strange about it was that in May 2018, when then Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, launched the Benefacts second analysis report at the Royal Irish Academy, he expressed the admiration and support he and his Department had for the Benefacts project.  He stated that he was willing to say he believed the output was crucial and the key thing was that all of this was possible only because Benefacts had done a huge volume of work to assemble all the information that is needed regarding what is happening in the non-profit sector, including the sources of income, the scale of the sector and the output that the sector generates.

Members could say this about their own constituencies.  It has been incredibly difficult to get information on that issue.  This is particularly relevant to the Committee of Public Accounts.  When a cost-benefit analysis of capital spending is done, it is done by building, not necessarily by service, on a CHO basis or by region.  I have broken it down into a small number of questions, with referral notes at the end if people are interested in where those questions came from.  If one is running a regional area, one cannot move people around like chess pieces on a board because of capital investment decisions.  These are people's lives.  However, we are only doing cost-benefit analysis by building and we are not looking at all the buildings as a community when it comes to mental health, disability, or whatever else it might be.  That seems to be the case with this CHO.  Is the HSE okay with this on a national basis?<\/p> <p>  If we move to Sl&aacute;intecare and a more regional model, will we continue to do cost-benefit analysis and capital investment on a piecemeal basis instead of looking at particular regions and how everything slots together?  One can see quickly from the notes I have attached that bits and bobs are happening all over the place, with an investment here and a rental there.  There does not seem to be any joined-up thinking.  When thinking of cost-benefit analysis, every regional area is almost like a campus and should be looked at as a whole.

I am not saying that every one of the recommendations should not have been implemented, but there have been significant changes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's remit in respect of strategic housing developments, which is where many of the issues are focused.  We are going to have some difficulty having a satisfactory meeting in advance of the publication of that report.  I know that the regulator is doing another review of the structures and procedures of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We do not know when the regulator will complete that or whether or not that will be a public document.  It might be worth writing to the regulator - whether that is appropriate or not is something we might consider - just to see exactly what the intention is there.  The checks and balances should not be down to an individual; they should be down to the structures being robust enough to make sure that issues do not arise.  I am sure that is why the regulator is in there.  The regulator is going to be important in the context of the current issues.  One of the issues we talked about the last time was the fact that one third of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's budget is now being spent on legal challenges in respect of judicial reviews.

I get the Deputy Murphy eile's point about the review that is ongoing.  Notwithstanding that, I recently took the opportunity to read back over the transcript of our last hearing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I recall, even as far back as my time as a councillor, that the issues that have arisen were flagged up as very likely scenarios.  When you have a system whereby a group of people - in some cases very small groups of people - sit behind closed doors making decisions and are not accountable for those decisions unless somebody has the funds to take them to the High Court, there needs to be the maximum level of accountability and transparency.  There is clearly a governance failure and a culture failure within the board that needs to be challenged.  There is plenty for us to engage with, and the Department is an important component in that.<\/p> <p>  I suggest that we keep our work plan flexible enough that if we need to bring An Bord Plean&aacute;la back before the committee after the publication of the report, we can do so.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, this is about tens of millions of euro spent on legal fees in fights against what was ostensibly the exact same position of the board, with the board losing every single time but continuing to go back.  It appears that nobody within An Bord Plean&aacute;la said that this needed to be analysed and assessed and that nobody within the Department asked what was going on here.  Yet representatives of An Bord Plean&aacute;la came into a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, where we deal with every Department and have limited time to go over documents, and several members were able to point out issues.  The board dismissed the potential of an issue, and now we find out about all sorts of further reviews that will probably cost further millions in their outworkings.  It will be one of the most important hearings of our term to date.  I suggest we ensure that we create the capacity to have An Bord Plean&aacute;la before the committee a second time if necessary.<\/p> <p>  I have another suggestion for our future work plan if the Chair is dealing with them now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#H01000","speaker":"1451"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":148,"content":"<p>Hold it until we have dealt with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#H01100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>May I ask a question of the Comptroller and Auditor General?

The associated activities and running costs are funded under two Votes.<\/p> <p>  The 2020 appropriation account for Vote 27 - International Co-operation, records gross expenditure of nearly &euro;548 million.  This represents around 63% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development and humanitarian assistance.  The programmes funded under the Vote are administered by the Department&rsquo;s development co-operation division.  The assistance is provided mainly on a bilateral basis, in direct co-operation with Government agencies in a number of targeted programme countries, or through a wide range of non-governmental agency partners.  There is also significant voted expenditure on a multilateral basis, including in support of specialised UN relief and development agencies.<\/p> <p>  Expenditure on the remainder of the Department&rsquo;s areas of operation is charged to Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs.  Gross expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;256 million in 2020.  This was distributed across five expenditure programmes, defined in terms of broad strategic objectives.  About three quarters of the expenditure was in the nature of administration expenses, including staff costs and the costs to provide Ireland's network of embassies and missions abroad.  Most of the non-administrative expenses comprised annual contributions to a range of international organisations and grants to support services for Irish emigrants.  Receipts into the Vote comprised mainly fees related to the issuing of passports and visas and other consular services.  In 2020, receipts of that nature amounted to just over &euro;34 million, representing 89% of the overall receipts retained in the account.  The 2020 fee receipts represented little more than half of the corresponding receipts in 2019.  This was primarily due to a significant drop in the level of passport applications in 2020, which the Department attributes to reduced demand for international travel due to Covid-19.<\/p><p>Because of the way in which Vote 28 is structured, the staffing and other resources dedicated to the Passport Office are not identifiable in the account.  However, the annual Estimate for the Vote, published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, indicates that the expenditure in relation to Passport Office activity is charged to programme A, our people.<\/p><p> The Estimate for Vote 28 also discloses that the number of passports issued fell very significantly, from the peak level of almost 937,000 in 2019 to just over 450,000 in 2020.  Despite the very significant drop in the volume of applications completed, the timeliness of delivery also fell back, as indicated in the Department&rsquo;s performance reporting.  In 2020, 88% of online passport applications were processed within 20 days.  This compares to 98% of online passport applications processed within the same time period in 2019.  For the typically more complicated paper-based passport applications, 87% were processed within 30 working days in 2020.  This was just marginally behind the 88% processed within the same time period in 2019.<\/p><p> Given the nature and scale of operation of the Passport Office, there may be merit in considering whether it should have its own expenditure programme within Vote 28 and for the related application fee receipts to be separately itemised in the appropriations-in-aid listing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#Z00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy.

The Secretary General, Mr. Joe Hackett, has asked me to convey his apologies for not being able to attend today due to illness.  I know he would want to have been here to answer the committee's questions in his role as the Department&rsquo;s Accounting Officer.<\/p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for inviting us to the committee to discuss the 2020 appropriation accounts for the Department of Foreign Affairs - Votes 27 and 28.  We have provided the committee a summary of the main areas of departmental expenditure and receipts in 2020.<\/p> <p>  The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade strategy statement 2017-2020, which set out the Department&rsquo;s work in five main areas: serving Irish citizens; actively engaging in the European Union; promoting Ireland&rsquo;s values internationally; advancing Ireland&rsquo;s prosperity; and strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s influence.<\/p> <p>  Vote 27 is structured around a single expenditure programme, namely, Ireland&rsquo;s work on development and humanitarian assistance, also known as Irish Aid.<\/p> <p>  The year under review, 2020, was a hugely challenging one for the public service.  For our Department, it meant re-prioritising and repurposing a number of our programmes to address unprecedented domestic and international challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, while ensuring that we did not let our focus slip from key priorities such as Northern Ireland, Brexit, our overseas development programme and winning Ireland&rsquo;s seat on the UN Security Council.<\/p> <p>  Our largest citizen service, the passport service, was required to significantly adapt its service in compliance with Government public health guidance.  The closure of the public offices during the different phases of the Government&rsquo;s response to Covid-19, which was essential from a public health perspective, coupled with the fall in demand for passports due to the travel restrictions, required us to alter our service provision.  This, combined with the pent-up demand for passports not renewed in 2020 and 2021, means we are still working through the effects of Covid-19 restrictions.  I know this is an issue of particular concern to the committee and I look forward to answering members' questions hand outlining the steps the Department has taken to address these issues to ensure the efficiency the public expects from the passport service is delivered.<\/p> <p>  During this year, we have made intensive efforts to significantly improve passport application processing times.  By international standards, Ireland continues to produce one of the most highly regarded products in the world.  With over 90% of applications now submitted online through a very user-friendly system, turnaround times for renewals in particular are efficient and very competitive when compared internationally.  So far this year, we have produced almost 700,000 passports, by far the largest number ever produced for a six-month period.  However, I acknowledge that our customer service response to queries to our call centre has fallen short of the service we want to provide.  This is not acceptable for our customers and I apologise.  I assure the committee that we are focusing on addressing this challenge as a matter of priority, including through the temporary recruitment of call centre staff previously engaged by the HSE.<\/p> <p>  As part of the Department&rsquo;s Covid-19 response, we also sought to support other Departments with their emergency response.  In addition to the redeployment of staff within the Department to meet the challenges we faced, 163 staff members from the Passport Office were redeployed to the Department of Social Protection to assist with the processing of the pandemic unemployment payments, PUP, and to the HSE to assist with contact tracing.<\/p> <p>  While the demand for passports fell away during the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for our emergency consular services increased to a level the Department had never previously experienced.  To ensure an effective consular response to this global crisis, our consular directorate was restructured and substantially reinforced at an early stage.  Demonstrating impressive solidarity across the Department, 150 additional colleagues, both at headquarters and overseas, received special consular training, with up to 80 officers temporarily redeployed to the reinforced Covid-19 consular response team at any one time.  With this reinforced consular team, we provided assistance, support and advice to more than 9,000 Irish citizens who were stranded overseas.  We directly chartered aircraft to facilitate three large-scale repatriations from Peru, India and Nigeria and worked with airlines to facilitate dedicated repatriation flights from Australia and the UK.  We also worked closely with our European and other partners to ensure that Irish citizens could avail of repatriation flights arranged by other countries and, through our mission network, assisted Irish citizens to secure seats on commercial flights.<\/p> <p>  We also recognised at an early stage the potential negative impact of the pandemic on our diaspora communities.  To mitigate this impact, a dedicated Covid-19 response fund for Irish communities abroad was established, funded through our emigrant support programme and focused on support for the elderly and newly vulnerable; mitigating the impact of social isolation; responding to individual cases of exceptional hardship; providing mental health supports and bereavement counselling; and moving more services online.<\/p> <p>  I will now give a brief overview of some of our other priorities in the Department during 2020.  As the committee will be aware, in 2020 we entered the final phase of the process that ultimately saw Ireland take a seat on the UN Security Council.  We are now in the second half of our two-year term on the Security Council.  Since taking up our seat last year, we have been active across the full council agenda, bringing our principled and independent perspective to a range of key issues, in line with the core principles for our term, namely, building peace, strengthening conflict prevention and ensuring accountability.  We have achieved some considerable successes despite the very challenging council dynamics and the changes in the working environment due to Covid-19.<\/p> <p>  From a development co-operation perspective, the year was defined by the Covid-19 pandemic, with the United Nations system at the heart of an integrated and urgent global response.  The allocation of almost &euro;550 million to Vote 27 enabled the Department, through the Irish Aid programme, to move quickly, with &euro;150 million allocated over the course of the year in support of that global response.  This included quadrupling Irish funding to the World Health Organization, WHO, to &euro;16 million and investing in the COVAX facility to ensure vaccine access.  This leveraged Irish Aid&rsquo;s work over many years building public health system capacity in developing countries, which enabled targeted engagements with health ministries, including supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, infection control measures and establishing ICU capabilities.<\/p> <p>  Recognising that this was more than a health crisis, Irish Aid funding enabled people to cope with the wider impacts of the pandemic through enabling social protection systems, allowing children to continue their education and a focus on reducing gender-based violence.  In addition, our focus on humanitarian assistance to those most vulnerable was maintained.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to humanitarian action is an expression of our values, supported by our financial investment which in 2020 was just over &euro;190 million.<\/p> <p>  Northern Ireland and managing the outcome of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union continued to be key priorities for the Department in 2020.  In particular, the New Decade, New Approach agreement in January 2020 represented a significant shared achievement of the political parties in Northern Ireland with the Irish and British Governments.  We also sustained engagement in Brussels, across the EU, in London, Washington and at home on addressing and mitigating the economic and political consequences of Brexit.<\/p> <p>  In 2020, the programme for Government moved trade promotion back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  My Department continues to work collaboratively at headquarters and through the mission network to deliver on the Government&rsquo;s trade and investment objectives and to promote Ireland as a great place in which to live, work, do business, invest and visit.  The Global Ireland 2025 strategy offers a framework and ambition for this ongoing collaboration across government.  In addition, our mission capacity overseas and our network of relationships were key to our consular and diaspora response in 2020.  We have recently opened 14 new missions, without which it would have been much more difficult to provide the consular support required in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, in particular to repatriate citizens from locations such as Peru, Colombia, Chile and New Zealand.<\/p> <p>  I also want to acknowledge the dedication and motivation of the Department&rsquo;s staff.<\/p><p>The Covid-19 crisis had and continues to have a profound impact on the Department's global operating environment, including on staffing, security and ICT functions.  The crisis has underlined the importance of investment in workforce planning, building resilience, supporting well-being for staff in challenging situations a long way from home, supporting remote working and engagement via digital platforms, and investing in health and safety and security of staff who serve our citizens and promote our interests overseas.<\/p><p> I am joined this morning by the director general for development co-operation, Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca; the director of the Passport Service, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Byrne; and Ms Jane Connolly, who is the director of the finance division.

People are in tears on the phone.  People ring the Passport Office hundreds of times, over and over, trying to get through to it and there is not a peep.<\/p><p> The uploading of photographs was mentioned.  I came across several issues with constituents who had applied for a passport.  For example, a constituent uploaded the photograph online and was given a target date.  The target date had passed and my constituent was starting to get a bit panicky.  She checked and saw a message to say the photograph had not uploaded.  She uploaded it again but got no confirmation at all.  She phoned the Passport Office.  Obviously, she would still be ringing them waiting for an answer.  My constituent uploaded it three times to be then told she had exceeded the security attempt.  Ironically, she was told to contact the Passport Office.  She contacted my office.  When we eventually got through, we were told by somebody there is a problem sometimes if photographs are uploaded with a phone and it is better to do it on the laptop.  Why, in the name of God, are people not told that rather than having them checking repeatedly?  That is only one example of simple things that could be rectified.  There are simple changes that could reduce the stress levels of people that have been caused by the Passport Office.<\/p><p> Another one, which is a bone of contention, is the target date.  When the Passport Service is seeking further information, sometimes it is after the target date that contact is made with the person to seek further information.  They scurry around and get that further information only to be told they are to the back of the queue.  Where does that make sense?  Why was that system let go unchecked?  Why is it still operational as of this week that people, despite the fact they were only contacted after their target date, submit the further information to be told they are at the back of the queue?  Many people have missed their chance of a holiday.  They have had two years of a pandemic.  Many people have set holidays.  If they work in certain areas, they are given two weeks in July or two weeks in June and they have no option to change their holidays.  Many families have been looking forward to their first holiday in possibly three years only to be told the passport has not arrived in time, so they miss their holiday and have no other option but to stay at home for their two weeks and think maybe next year they might get away or, as in multiple cases, a single family member does not get his or her passport on time when other members have and that person has to stay at home.  It beggars belief.  I am not being rude, but it is utter incompetence having a system whereby a target date is given, the person is not contacted, and when he or she is contacted for further information, that person goes to the back of the queue.<\/p><p> There is another issue about watermarks.  There was another constituent who had submitted the birth certificate three times to be accused wrongly of sending in copies.  My office spoke to someone who issues civil legal documentation and was told there was a problem in the Passport Office reading watermarks.  Is that true?  Has it been corrected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#DD06500","speaker":"1497","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1656577800,"counter":355,"content":"<p>Briefly, on the queuing and going back to the back of the queue, we heard what people had to say on that and we have now changed that.

The person says her family holiday is booked on the 6th and is told she must wait another fortnight.  Why is there no emphasis put on those who submit - Mr. Conlan said early the bulk of the backlog is waiting for further information - given the fact they have applied for their passport in ample time?  They have applied in sufficient time, for example, two months.  I could cite a list of cases here only it would take up my ten minutes.  They are disgraceful.

Time is limited, so I will try to keep them concise and I ask the witnesses to try to do the same with their answers.  Regarding the Garda verification of passports, I had a situation where a constituent had a passport application witnessed at the Garda station in Edenderry, which is a town of approximately 11,000 people.  The person works in Dublin, as many people living in Edenderry do.  Dublin is 40 or 45 miles away.  People are away all day and it could be 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock before they get home in the evening.  The garda in the station in Edenderry witnessed the application and did the whole process.  A situation then arose where the Passport Office could not contact the Garda station in Edenderry because it was not a 24-hour station.  I then posted a message on my Facebook page advising people to go to either Tullamore or Portlaoise in Laois-Offaly because those are 24-hour stations.<\/p> <p>  Is Ms Byrne saying that such a situation cannot arise now?

I believe it is called Ireland House.  Currently, many State services are being run out of Dubai for quite a large part of the Middle East, even Egypt and other locations.  It is crucial for the likes of Bord Bia and other State agencies to have a base on the African continent where they could operate for that region.<\/p> <p>  I come from a farming background.  There has been political instability in north Africa and I know there was a huge drive for democracy there; one of the major catalysts in that respect was the increase in food prices.  It is really worrying to see even the minimum progress - it is not perfect - being put at risk in 2023.  We can look at the grain port of Mariupol and the Ukrainian harvest that will not reach the market.  Egypt, for example, was the largest supporter of Ukrainian grain and the single largest net importer of grain in the world, if I am correct.  I am using Egypt as an example but those countries in North Africa are crying out for new sources of agrifood products.  There are individual concerns relating to the procurement processes around how to obtain food, where it is government-controlled rather than market-led.  The Department of Foreign Affairs could make a big difference to Irish agriculture by focusing on that area.<\/p> <p>  I am a Corkonian and I raise the fact that all printing of passports happens in Dublin.  I do not want to be overly populist and I appreciate the reason for the backlog in passports was down to the human resources side of things, as Ms Byrne indicates.  Passport machines are capable of printing even more than they are now but the paperwork has to be done for that.<\/p> <p>  If somebody completes the documentation, it is an unmerciful journey to go from Castletownbere, Kerry, Wexford, Waterford and Tipperary to Balbriggan in north Dublin in order to collect a passport in an emergency.  There is much merit in having at least one machine in the south of the country, particularly any location with good road connectivity.  It would make a mighty difference.<\/p> <p>  Unfortunately, often in these circumstances, as I am sure the witnesses are far more aware of than we are, there can be incredible tragedy involved where people are required to collect a passport in an emergency situation.

There is a coherent Irish offer to countries on the continent of Africa, in order that we can build and share and learn how to do climate-smart agriculture that gives everybody quick nutrition wins.<\/p><p> We are looking at certain areas of Irish expertise, in particular, including good seeds.  In Ireland, one gets approximately 16 tonnes of potatoes per hectare in productivity.  In Kenya, one gets about 5 tonnes.  We are sharing our expertise, not just on seeds, but on storage and value chains, so that it is also about value addition in business.  We are doing that but there is more we can do and there are more partnerships we can build with the Irish farming sector on that.  We are on a journey.  We also have a small scheme between our Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we provide seed capital for Irish agribusiness to look at business opportunities in Africa in partnership with African companies.  That is part of that journey.<\/p><p> I will pick up on the Deputy point about Egypt.  I had a conversation last night with an Egyptian lady who was here yesterday and who met colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine precisely to look at where partnerships could be taken forward between Ireland and Egypt around better food, with a view to doing something in advance of the Sharm el-Sheikh Conference of the Parties, COP, climate change conference in November.<\/p><p> We are trying to use the aid programme as smartly as we can both to find opportunities for Ireland and to address the global food crisis.  While we have to invest in systems to get better food to grow, there is an emerging hunger crisis because of what is going on in Ukraine, specifically in the Horn of Africa about which some Deputies got a briefing in the past week or two.

That is the human aspect of it.  The aspect we are discussing at this meeting is the Irish money and other EU funds that are going in there but the human aspect is the most important part of it.  It is appalling that Israel feels it can just drive a bulldozer through this.  I would ask the Department to take a strong line with the Israeli authorities and with the embassy here.  We are taking a strong line on Russia, and rightly so.  This might be overshadowed by the war in Ukraine but the suffering in Palestine since 1947 is outrageous.  This State, the Irish people and Palestinian support groups have played a positive role in trying to highlight that suffering and it is important that we do that.  We may be falsely accused of being other things because we raise it.

It would cost an additional &euro;300,000 to support those machines for a year.  A significant investment would need to be made in making such a decision.  We need to look at that in the context of the services we provide through our online service, that the majority of renewals are done within a fairly short time period, and a four-day service is available to people from the Cork office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022063000002#RR01200","nonspeaker":"Ms Siobh&aacute;n Byrne"},{"type":"speech","time":1656577800,"counter":756,"content":"<p>Are there costings available?
