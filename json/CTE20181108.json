He is joined by Georgina O'Mahoney, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are holding over the minutes to a further meeting and moving on to the next item, correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence.  Category A is briefing documents and opening statements in respect of the meetings.  Nos. 1701 A and 1702 A are from Ms Cliodhna Sweeney of the State Claims Agency, dated 6 November 2018, and enclose the opening statement and briefing information for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish this.  Agreed?  Agreed.  We will discuss it during our meeting with the State Claims Agency, which will begin shortly.<\/p> <p>  The next category is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, correspondence following up from meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts and other items for publishing.  We held over a number of items from previous meetings.  We can continue to hold some over but I want to take two of them because they have been on our desk for a while.  No. 1490 B is from the Government accounting unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 18 July.  We have a duty to deal with it because it was received so far back.  It encloses a minute from the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in response to our first periodic report which covered the period from September to October 2017.  This might not take as long as it looks like it might because I have gone through it.  If members are happy for me to guide them through these they can pick me up on any point.  We have to deal with some of these.  They are an important follow-up on our own work programme.  We have already noted and published the correspondence.  <\/p> <p>  We are now dealing with No. 1490 B from the Government accounting unit which relates to our period report.  We had a series of recommendations in that report.  The system is that the report goes to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which gets responses from the individual line Departments and comes back with the responses from the Ministers.  We will not debate all of these again because we have debated them at length.  The first recommendation in the report is B.1.  This letter deals with our earlier recommendations and the report we published in respect of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Industrial Development Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, Tusla and the Health Service Executive.  I propose to quickly summarise the responses from the Ministers.  I will not read them in detail as it is an extensive document but our recommendations have been out there for quite some time.  <\/p> <p>  The first issue related to the reopening of Garda stations.  The second recommendation was that the reopening of Garda stations should be included in the Estimates process for 2018.  These stations included Stepaside.  The third recommendation was that the OPW should carry out a detailed examination of Stepaside Garda station.  We recently received detailed information from the OPW.  It gave us, for the first ever time on the public record, a breakdown of the costs of the different projects in respect of the Garda stations.  It has accepted the response which said that it should be a policing decision.  We have received that information since.  We note that and move on.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, we recommended that an examination of the cost of agency staff be carried out.  We all understand that employing agency staff is more expensive.  The response says that the Minister for Health accepts the recommendation with regard to HIQA carrying out an examination.  We are now writing to HIQA or the Department of Health as appropriate for a follow-up on that recommendation.<\/p><p>We want an update on recommendation B.4.<br\/><br\/>We will move on to B.5, which is a request.  At that stage, we had asked for additional staff vacancies in HIQA to be filled.  The Department stated recently that appointments below the grade of principal officer on the standard scale no longer require sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Health can give sanction directly.  The Department gave us the numbers, which have increased from 198 at the end of 2016 to 216 at the end of 2017.  There has been an improvement and we will return to that issue.<br\/><br\/>We asked for a breakdown of the consultancy services mentioned in HIQA's 2016 accounts and for further information to be provided.  We will ask the secretariat to circulate a copy of the 2017 HIQA accounts and we can see whether the authority complied with that in its 2017 accounts.<br\/><br\/>The next item relates to IDA Ireland.  The committee recommended that IDA Ireland review its methodology to verify the number of jobs created by its client companies.  To be put it bluntly, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation does not accept this recommendation.  We will discuss this briefly because a follow-up question arises.  The Department states that it carries out the employment annual survey, which is done on a voluntary basis whereby companies return the survey.  The Department states the survey has a track record over many years of identifying employment trends.  I find this interesting because it is a bit like the practice of basing figures on house completions on ESB connections.  The argument that it should continue because it has been taking place for a number of years does not satisfy us.  To give us some comfort that this survey is meaningful we will write to IDA Ireland and ask what percentage of companies overall respond to its survey.  If the survey covers 5% of companies, we need to know that and if it has a 95% response rate, we can have a high degree of confidence in it.  We need some information on the survey and on how extensive it is.  We will draft an appropriate letter.  Maybe it will be fine or maybe there will be a problem, but we do not know based on the answers provided so far.<br\/><br\/>We will move onto transport infrastructure.  This recommendation was about publishing post-project reviews of public private partnerships, PPPs.  That has been accepted.  Following our meeting on this issue, our recommendation was implemented by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 26 March when it issued Circular 06\/2018.  The circular provides that all new projects must publish a post-project review within a reasonable timeframe and reviews for current projects must be published as soon as possible.  That is ongoing issue to which we will return because PPPs are part of our work programme this year.<br\/><br\/>The next recommendation was that Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, avail of road safety reports from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to develop its objectives for future investment.  The Department states that TII avails of the reports as they become available and continues to use road safety benefits in prioritising where funding is allocated and improvement works are carried out.<br\/><br\/>The next item relates to Tusla.  The recommendation was to ensure a proper service level agreement is in place with all Tusla funded organisations.  At this stage, we will write to Tusla requesting an update on how it is getting on with the recommendation because it was made a couple of months ago.  Recommendation B.12, which also relates to Tusla, is on procurement.  There are serious issues with procurement in Tusla.  The organisation states it now has an internal procurement support section which deals with communications, data access and training.  We will continue to monitor that.  The recommendation has been accepted.  <br\/><br\/>The next recommendation was that Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report, Audit of Processes and Procedures adopted by Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Initiating the Provisions of Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991, be implemented.  That has been accepted.  That is following up on a policy issue.  The letter we received in July stated that Tusla and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were currently in the process of agreeing a memorandum of understanding on information sharing and data protection.  We need an update on whether such an agreement is now in place.  We will probably not receive a copy of the agreement but we want to know whether the memorandum of understanding has been completed.<br\/><br\/>B.15 deals with the delays in the HSE implementing the process of appointing a lead community health organisation, CHO, in cases where national organisations have a number of agreements with different community health organisations.  The HSE is now appointing one CHO region to deal with that, which is fine.  We will raise the matter with the HSE when its representatives appear before us again.<br\/><br\/>The next item was the review being carried out by the HSE regarding non-compliance with public sector pay policies.  This is a little dated but the HSE indicated that 745 business cases had been presented by section 38 organisations.  Some 351 had been dealt with and 394 were being examined.  According to the HSE, given the scale of the complexity of the matter, it would not be possible to bring the process to a conclusion early in 2018.  However, it indicated the process should be concluded by the end of 2018.  We will ask for an update on that.  The HSE accepted our recommendation but we want to see if it is being implemented.<br\/><br\/>We also recommended making an <i>ex gratia <\/i>payment to employees of Console employees.  The response indicated that the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform was not in a position to comment on the matters arising in respect of the organisation Console, having regard to the fact that this is a section 39 agency and, accordingly, its staff are not public servants.  That is fine and we will note that response.  We have done what we can.  Individual members can chase up on the matter but the Minister is not accepting the recommendation and we cannot make him do so.  There is nothing to prevent individual members from continuing to raise the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#B00300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":8,"content":"<p>Do we know how many employees have been affected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#C00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Perhaps we could write to the HSE on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#C00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Yes, we should ask it to clarify the position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#C00400","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>We will ask the HSE to give us an update, including figures on the original number of staff, the number of staff who transferred and the number who did not transfer.  We will at least ask the HSE to provide the current position on the numbers.  That is the periodic report.  We will follow up on a few matters.  We are noting many matters and there are others on which we are seeking additional information.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I want to deal with is the second periodic report, which covered our work from November to December 2017 and which we launched on 28 March 2018.  We received a reply from the Government accounting unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on 9 August last.  In fairness, we cannot allow these matters to go on any longer.  If we make recommendations we should follow up on them and I will try to do so on these recommendations.  I have read through them and if anyone wants to take up any of the specific recommendations over which I have skirted, that is fine.  I made a genuine effort to go through them as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  This report dealt with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; education and training boards; the Department of Education and Skills; An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; the Department of Employment and Social Protection; and the Department of Finance.  The first recommendation was for the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Members will laugh at this.  We talked about planning for major projects such as broadband infrastructure, sustainable energy and landfill remediation.  The Department tells us it had hoped to have agreement finalised in respect of broadband infrastructure.  I will read the last sentence of the correspondence from the Department.  \"The Department is working to a timeline of having selected a preferred bidder by September 2018.\"  That is a little ironic at this stage.  Broadband is on our work programme primarily for that reason, although we have not covered it yet.  This was based on the 2016 accounts, with which we are dealing.  It is in the 2017 accounts.  The planning process is historical and has been ongoing for a couple of years.  Where we are today is a result of what has been done for the past couple of years.  It goes without saying that the committee will return to that topic.  We will include it in our work programme.<\/p> <p>  The minute mentions the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and landfill remediation.  There are a number of landfill remediation issues in the country.  We will ask for an update based on our report.<\/p> <p>  The next item was oversight arrangements in respect of RT&Eacute;.  While an oversight agreement and legislation are in place, the Department does not want to put a service level agreement in place.  It states that it would be inappropriate to do so and that it has an oversight agreement.<\/p><p>It has the legislation and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as the regulator but the Department maintains that in the case of RT&Eacute; a service level agreement is inappropriate in view of other issues included into it.  We have discussed this at length.  I do not know how much further we can go.  We have made our recommendation and that is the answer we got.  We will just note it, bank it and hold it for another day.  <\/p><p> In regard to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, this relates to 71 landfill sites.  We covered that in a separate recommendation and we want an update on the remediation of the sites in question.<\/p><p> The next item was the national broadband plan, on which we made another recommendation.  The issue is in our work programme and we will deal with it.<\/p><p> The next item is Ireland's potential liability for not meeting its 2020 carbon emissions targets.  The recommendation has been accepted and the Department stated it has established an interdepartmental work group, comprising a number of wonderful people, which is examining this issue.  It also stated that Ireland is permitted to bank and use surplus emissions credits from the years it overachieved on its annual emissions targets, from 2013 to 2015, to comply with the effort-sharing decision.  That is also the case with any surplus due and carried over in the 2008 to 2013 Kyoto Protocol compliance period, thereby reducing the net additional cost to the Exchequer.  We will ask for an update of the workings of that interdepartmental group.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#C00500","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>Part of the reason there was an overachievement was that there was a significant downturn.  It is disingenuous to use that as part of the compliance.  Once the economy started to reignite, we essentially went further backwards.  That kind of response means we will be significantly exposed in monetary terms, never mind the survival of human beings on the planet.  In economic terms, we were told by the Department of Finance that the expectation was that there would be fined &euro;600 million per annum from 2021 onwards because we are not in compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>Much of the response refers to purchases of surplus emissions allowances from other European Union member states.  Deputy Catherine Murphy is correct in reference to the years of overachieving.  Using the word \"overachieving\" is making out that the recession, and the level of development we did not have at that time, were achievements.  That is set out in the document.  We will ask for an update on the interdepartmental work group.  Members are free to raise these policy issues in the Chamber and other forums. It is a major policy issue.  The committee will seek an update on the working group.<\/p> <p>  The next item related to education and training boards, ETBs.  We discussed this issue extensively and requested improvement in the presentation of appropriation accounts to show payments to the education and training boards.  We also recommended the strengthening of oversight of the governance of the ETB sector, the implementation of performance indicators for ETBs and that ETB boards be strengthened and comprehensive governance training given.  All of those recommendations have been accepted and we are as good as we can be in terms of getting on top of the ETB sector.  We made one other recommendation that the chairperson of the ETB boards take responsibility for the submission of accounts.  That has been accepted and there has been a major improvement in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The committee recommends that the minutes of the ETB boards be made available publicly and promptly through their websites following approval by the boards.  That recommendation has also been accepted.  Some ETBs do that already while others do not.  The Department stated that it intends to make this an explicit requirement in the context of its current review of the code of practice of the governance of ETBs.  It is good it will be made a requirement from now on because some of the ETBs do not do it.  We are achieving something. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>There is a further item of correspondence we will reach later, No. 1566 B, which is from the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00400","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>We will come back to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>It covers some of this area as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00600","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":18,"content":"<p>We will discuss the acceptance of the specific recommendation regarding the Kildare and Wicklow ETB investigation.  The committee also recommended that the outcome be established and agreed between the Department of Education and Skills and Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.  It was also recommended that all future public funding to ETBI be clearly aligned to clear and measurable goals.  The ETBI stated that the format of the engagement will be reviewed for 2019 with a view to including more measurable goals, where appropriate.  That is good and we will presume that will be done in 2019.<\/p> <p>  The committee recommended that the Department of Education and Skills carry out a full assessment of the risk associated with an ETB chief executive and the director not being based in the head offices.  That has been accepted and, as an initial step, the Department will collect further information from the ETBs on how functions are managed across their offices, the locations of the relevant senior personnel and it will engage further as appropriate.  The Department is taking up that recommendation and obtaining the necessary information to help it do that.  <\/p> <p>  Recommendation 15 was to the Department of Education and Skills and referred to the conclusion of a transfer of property - here we go again - from religious organisations to the State under the redress scheme.  That job is not being done and we are having to do it for the Department.  We have been doing it here every quarter.  We are being told that quarterly reports are being produced but they indicate that the dates are being moved out.  That issue will not be dropped from our agenda.  We are pleased the Department has accepted the recommendation but we want it to ensure it is implemented.<\/p> <p>  The next item is the published quarterly report of the Department of Education and Skills.  We are agreed on that.  Some of our recommendations are on the same topic but from different angles.  We had a recommendation that the Department of Education and Skills complete and publish the Caranua eligibility review forthwith.  The Department stated the review had been completed and published in May 2018, which was after our report was produced.<\/p> <p>  The next recommendation was to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It referred to the Garda internal audit service and improvements in respect of Templemore Garda College.  That has been accepted.  I can deal with all of these now.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na wrote back to us stating that 11 of our 19 recommendations were completed or closed.  The Policing Authority is dealing with that issue but it is no harm for us to ask for an update on the recommendations in the report.  There were 19 and 11 had been completed when we received this letter in the summer.  We also had other recommendations on all of the internal audit reports.  That correspondence will cover it.  <\/p> <p>  In recommendation 21 the committee recommended that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection prioritise the recruitment of additional medical assessors to ensure that cases awaiting medical review are dealt with in a timely manner.  The Department states that a further recruitment drive to establish new medical assessors on a panel is proposed to commence in quarter 3 of 2018.  Will that add to the problem with disability payments?  It could be a different issue.  There was a slowness in processing any application that had a medical assessment because there was a shortage of medical assessors.  The Department has stated it is recruiting more assessors in quarter 3 of 2018.  <\/p> <p>  The next item was the committee's recommendation that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection focus social welfare debt recovery efforts on the 5.7% of cases which contribute 60% of the outstanding debt.  The Department has accepted that.  We also made a recommendation that every amount on its books of under &euro;100 should be written off.  To chase those debts would probably cost more than it is worth.  The Department has also accepted that and it is looking at the procedure in respect of writing off older and smaller debts.  I am sure that the Comptroller and Auditor General will report on how the Department gets on to us next year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00700","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":19,"content":"<p>On the medical assessors, I have asked about this in parliamentary questions on a number of occasions.  It seems it is not just a question of recruiting additional medical assessors.  There may also be a problem of retention.  General practitioners, GPs, are the nominated people around the country.  We may need to ask if there is an issue with retaining as well as recruiting medical assessors.  It is causing delays and they in turn cause costly administrative delays.  That is an issue that we might write to the Department about.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00800","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will write back to the Department in respect of recommendation 21 and ask that it give us the number of medical assessors it had, how many have left, how many have been recruited and the net increase.  It is fine to say a further three full-time equivalent medical assessors are expected to be recruited by the end of July.  That may only be replacing three who have left.  We need the full picture so we will ask for that.<\/p><p>Members will remember the use of the word \"fraud\" in various publicity campaigns by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection whereas we said it should use the phrase \"suspected fraud\".  The Department accepts our recommendation and says consideration is being given to the use of the terminology recommended by the committee.  It goes on to say that while overpayments resulting from suspected fraud and fraudulent activity by customers constituted on average 39% of total overpayments in the four years 2014 to 2017, customer error amounts to an average of 43% over the same period and overpayments arising from errors by officials related to 2.75% of overpayments.  Obviously, quite a lot is due to error and it is unfair to categorise it as fraud or even suspected fraud.  It is important to keep those figures separate and we are achieving that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#D00900","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I do not know whether that is what the Department is accepting.

We are agreed.  We will write and ask for the position on that.<\/p> <p>  The committee recommends closer co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the issue of outstanding debt relating to redundancy in employers' insolvency schemes.  It is no coincidence there are similar figures.  It is said that two thirds of the companies are insolvent and the money is unlikely to be recovered.  The recommendation states that a dedicated debt management team should engage directly with employers with a view to recovering debt.  We are writing to them in this regard.  We want details of the number of staff and the work programme of that debt management team.  I got the impression they might just send out a statement once a year but we want to know the detailed work programme carried out by that team and the breakdown of the work.  We understand that many of these companies are gone but they are not all gone.  There is money out there that I do not think they are properly and actively pursuing.  That is why we suggested talking to Revenue.  We should be able to get details from Revenue in regard to those companies that are still trading and making returns for VAT or PAYE.  We will see if that can be done and it is something we will come back to in our work programme.  In the meantime, we will ask for the detail on the team.<\/p> <p>  The next item concerns the special liquidator for IBRC, on which we had various recommendations.  Since then, the work of the committee has overtaken the various recommendations we had on that issue and we have discussed it at recent meetings with the Department.<\/p> <p>  The next recommendation was that there be a D&aacute;il debate on the utilisation of NAMA&rsquo;s projected terminal surplus of &euro;3 billion in view of the fact EUROSTAT and the EU have no rules on this due to the unique nature of NAMA.  That &euro;3 billion we mentioned then was &euro;3.5 billion when NAMA came before us during the summer, and it issued its most recent quarterly report yesterday, with media reports today saying it expects that terminal surplus to be &euro;4.5 billion.  The Minister accepts the recommendation on a D&aacute;il debate and we can discuss whether the committee initiates it.  The recommendation states: \"However, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt and reduce our debt servicing costs.\"  That is the stated position.<\/p> <p>  There is a second recommendation that, \"a Dail debate takes place on the orderly wind down of NAMA or the possible consideration of use of NAMA for other specific purposes.\"  It is made very clear that, under the European Commission approval for the establishment of NAMA, it has to finish its functions by the end of 2020 and that any extension of NAMA's functions could breach existing state aid approval.  It got state aid approval exemptions to 2020 and, without EU approval, the Government cannot go beyond that.  That does not preclude using the expertise in NAMA for some other purpose in regard to the housing crisis, however, which is another issue.  We will note this.  We have done our bit so far.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#E01000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Do we know whether there was an expectation of surplus, although I hate to use the word \"surplus\" because, in fact, it is a huge loss, or a surplus on a huge haircut.

When we had the Department of Finance in here some months ago as part of this debate, we asked about the use of these funds and I asked whether there were any EU rules on it.  The answer is no because NAMA is unique at the European level.  It is a once-off.  While, as I read out earlier, the intention has always been to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our national debt, that is just the Government position, not an EU requirement.  It is just the Government's intention.  Europe is not telling it to do that.  Let us be very clear.  The use of the surplus is a matter for the Government, although it will probably have to clear it with Europe and Europe would probably love it to be used for that purpose, knowing Europe.

It is useful to have a debate on the issue in the Oireachtas, particularly for this committee in terms of the amount of work it has done on NAMA.<\/p> <p>  The next item is recommendation No. 5, which is a general recommendation rather than one specific to the Departments.  It provides that the chairpersons and boards of every public body be asked to ensure that their financial statements are submitted on time.  This has been accepted by Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Good progress is being made in this regard.<\/p> <p>  Recommendation No. 6 is that the appropriation accounts be re-appraised and that additional notes be provided with the accounts identifying sectors and outlining expenditure on all public organisations.  This is accepted.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is currently examining the layout of the appropriation accounts with a view to enhancing the information provided to assist the readers of the accounts.  There have been some improvements this year in regard to the listing of all of the organisations under the remit of each Department, which we never had before.  Having the information Vote by Vote is not only great for the committee, it is good for everyone else.  We will monitor the layout of the reports each year.<\/p> <p>  The final recommendation is that the engagement of consultants or professional advisers for any public contract should have a time limit attached.  Open-ended contracts are an issue because we cannot prove value for money if there is not a regular retendering process.  This recommendation has been accepted in principle but as what is proposed does not always happen we will continue to monitor the public contracts.<\/p> <p>  We have completed our discussion on several months' of last year's work.  Many of our recommendations have been accepted and implemented.  We are seeking further information on the ones that have not been accepted.  We are also seeking verification as to whether additional information is being sought from various Departments on a number of the recommendations that have been accepted.  <\/p> <p>  We move now to correspondence received in the last week.  Correspondence 1682 is from the chief operations officer of Teagasc providing follow-up notes requested by the committee at the meeting with Teagasc a couple of weeks ago in regard to advisory fees, regional analysis of viable farming, increasing financial charges, a comparative note on pay and pensions, the percentage of land owned by Teagasc that is in forestry, details of consultancy costs and a breakdown by county of farm debt.

Agreed.<\/p> <p>  Correspondence 1683 is from Mr. Niall Cody, chairperson of the Revenue Commissioners, providing follow-up notes requested in regard to forecasting tax receipts.

We will ask Revenue if it can also deal with the Vote at next week's meeting.  If it can, it would save it a further visit.  If not, we will deal with the Vote separately.

The Deputy has asked the committee to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to report on whether the HSE and the National Ambulance Service are operating within procurement guidelines in the case of these two companies and the committee to look at the procurement process.  I propose, in the first instance, with his permission, that we forward the Deputy's correspondence to the HSE and seek a full response on the matters raised.

However, if data protection legislation has been breached, he should contact the Data Protection Commissioner and if protected disclosures legislation has been breached, the appropriate body to deal with the matter is the Workplace Relations Commission.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We will tell the individual that we will deal with the matter when we receive the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Breaches of data protection legislation are matters for the Data Protection Commissioner, while breaches of protected disclosures legislation are matters for the Workplace Relations Commission, not the Committee of Public Accounts.<\/p> <p>  There is another item with which I want to deal.

The correspondence refers to specific individuals and contains a considerable amount of personal information relating to the individual and his employment with the HSE.  The case is complex and goes back a number of years.  The correspondence includes copies of a complaint made to the Office of the Ombudsman that refers to court proceedings instigated by the correspondent against the HSE and Tusla.  The correspondent was advised by the Office of the Ombudsman that his complaint did not come under its remit.  The individual contacted the secretariat in October to inquire about the status of the correspondence because we had not dealt with it in public session when we received it and mentioned there was a case before the courts related to the matters raised in the correspondence.  I propose that we do not circulate electronically and that we write to the correspondent to advise him that it is not within the remit of the committee to deal with matters that are before the courts or to deal with individual employment matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The correspondence is available from the secretariat should any member wish to see it.  <\/p> <p>  No. 1639 C is correspondence from an individual, dated 4 October 2018, relating to St Munchin's Community Centre, Kileely Court, Limerick.  The correspondence is submitted as a protected disclosure and relates to an employment matter.  It has not been circulated electronically because it contains a number of possibly defamatory allegations.  The correspondent states a complaint has been submitted to the Workplace Relations Commission.  Members will recall that we have received another item, No. 1396, from an anonymous source regarding St Munchin's.  It is not clear whether the two items are linked.  Regarding the item today, I propose that we do not circulate it and that we advise the individual that the committee does not generally investigate matters that are being investigated elsewhere and that it is not within our remit to investigate individual employment matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It is an employment grievance that is before other State bodies and some of the correspondence is possibly defamatory so we cannot circulate it.  It concerns St. Munchin's Community Centre in Limerick.  We have already received one item of correspondence from an anonymous source concerning St. Munchin's and we now have correspondence from an individual whose name is there.  They may or may not be connected.  We cannot know because one is anonymous.  This correspondence contains potentially defamatory material.

We were given assurances.  The contract for the two laboratories states that the ownership of the slides resides with the HSE and they can be returned within three days.  I have a note of that.  According to an article in <i>The Irish Mirror<\/i>today, a solicitor dealing with one or some of the cases is harshly critical of the delay in releasing these slides.  I raise this issue because we previously raised it here and received assurances that there would be no delay.  This correspondence seems to talk about a process to ensure the integrity of the slides and minimise risk and I agree we want that to happen.  We do not want any damage because the slides' integrity must be preserved.

Separately, we recently wrote to the State Claims Agency about the overall bill facing the State as a result of medical negligence.  To be upfront, we sought very extensive details of the breakdown of the figure of &euro;2.4 billion for medical negligence claims.  We have received some information today and I spoke to Mr. Breen earlier in the week.  Some information is not yet available but will come to us in due course.  <\/p> <p>  One of the items I want to highlight for the public which I do not believe has been made public before is the breakdown of the estimated liability by size of the estimated claims.  The figures about which we are talking are the sums for which the State Claims Agency expects the cases to be settled.<\/p><p>The cases have not necessarily been to court, but they are not our valuations.  They are the State Claims Agency's valuations of how it thinks these claims might work out.  We asked for details of the claims that the agency expects to settle for less than &euro;1 million, between &euro;1 million and &euro;4 million, between &euro;4 million and &euro;10 million, and in excess of &euro;10 million.  The agency tells us that it expects to settle 2,954 cases on its books for less than &euro;1 million, 207 claims for between &euro;1 million and &euro;4 million, 91 claims for somewhere between &euro;4 million and &euro;10 million and 113 cases for in excess of &euro;10 million each.  The Committee of Public Accounts has to look at these figures because medical negligence is a major bill, and it goes without saying that the less medical negligence, the more money the HSE has for its work in the health service and building hospitals among other things.<br\/><br\/>I want to put the information on the large figure into public domain as it has not been known to date.  I refer to the more than 100 cases with the State Claims Agency each of which will cost in excess of &euro;10 million.  I understand that ten of those cases are in the Dublin North East hospital group, 17 are in the Dublin Midlands hospital group, ten are in the Ireland East hospital group, 22 cases are in the South\/South West hospital group, 29 cases are in the Saolta University hospital group, 14 cases are in the University Limerick hospital group and five are in the Children's hospital group.  The 113 cases are estimated to cost the taxpayer approximately &euro;1.4 billion, which is an average of &euro;12.8 million each.  The figures are staggering.  We know some of the cases are catastrophic and involve lifelong issues.  Some of the costs will be very high.<br\/><br\/>We do not have information today on a difficult issue, which is one the committee will have to discuss with the State Claims Agency, in terms of the 3,000 cases on its books, especially some of the 113 cases, namely, whether any one medical professional is connected with more than one case.  If a number of cases have been taken against an individual and negligence is an issue, then action should be taken to ensure such an individual does not continue to practise in a hospital.  I had a conversation with Mr. Breen earlier and I will ask him to comment on it before we begin to discuss CervicalCheck.  Many of the claims that are made, especially involving maternity departments, involve several staff.  When something goes wrong, one cannot always pinpoint it to one individual, so individuals <i>per se<\/i>are not held personally responsible, and the hospital, State or HSE takes overall corporate responsibility for defending the case.  That means, however, we are not formally compiling incidences of consultants who might be involved in several cases and we need to know such information.  The State needs to know there is a system in place.<br\/><br\/>The information I outlined is based on hospital groups, but ultimately we need to get the information on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  I accept that issues will arise for hospitals in that, if there were a couple of big cases in one hospital, it might look bad, but everyone knows the big hospitals will have the biggest figures and we would expect the smaller ones to have the smallest figures.  That is an issue to which we will return.  I accept Mr. Breen has said that publishing those figures individually could cause other unintended problems as it might identify cases and compromise the State Claims Agency's defence or it might be unfair in certain circumstances.<br\/><br\/>The Committee of Public Accounts will examine further the expenditure of &euro;2.4 billion.  We have got the first headline breakdown of the figures and we will discuss the matter of further information with the State Claims Agency.  From dealing with the HSE and the State Claims Agency, my observation is that there is a demarcation line that is not helpful to the State.  Once a case is sent to the State Claims Agency, the HSE says it is nothing to do with it anymore and it is for the State Claims Agency to tell it at the end of the year how much it owes for the cases that have been settled.  I do not think there is enough ongoing joint work between the two agencies to identify where the problems lie.  We should not find out there is a recurring problem in a hospital at the end of a case settlement for &euro;10 million.  People need to know and to take action on matters as they arise and not wait for cases to be settled.<br\/><br\/>Those are my personal observations.  They are not the views of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee will discuss the issue and members may have stronger views or different views on the issue.  As a committee I am flagging that the sum of &euro;2.4 billion should be available to build hospitals and to provide health services and should not be spent on medical negligence.  I have asked for details of the increase in that bill in recent years.  We must discuss what the HSE can do in the first place, not to mind the State Claims Agency, to reduce the number of medical negligence cases in hospitals and other health settings.  Mr. Breen might make a brief comment.  If he wants to disagree with anything I have said, he should please do so, I am just making opening remarks and this is something we will discuss again on a more structured basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#L00400","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541667600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>There is a good deal of interaction between the State Claims Agency and the HSE.  We regularly furnish each chief executive of the hospital groups and the chief executives of the individual hospitals and HSE management with management information reports that are relative to their adverse event data and all the claims data so that they are aware of where their claims are coming from.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there are regular meetings at a very high level between the executive management team of the State Claims Agency and the executive management team of the HSE where we exchange information with it about particular things, patterns, groups or clusters that we might be seeing, or very often worries that we might have around a particular topic.  I would hate for it to be characterised as nothing happening while a claim is being settled and that the HSE does not care about it.  Our claims team in the State Claims Agency and the clinical risk team liaise, and there is a great deal of learning that we take from closed claims about why we had to settle at a particular level, if there are lessons to be learnt from that, and how we feed it back into the system.  We constantly do that.<\/p> <p>  As you said, Chairman, we had a conversation and I will outline one of the reasons we do not break down the data on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  NHS Resolution, which is our equivalent in the UK, has what it calls fact sheet 5, and it issues it publicly and regularly.  It is a trust-by-trust analysis.  It breaks down the information in the way we have into a group of hospitals.  Its reason for not publishing it at a more granular level is in line with our reason, namely, that claims and claims analysis are not necessarily a good measure of quality because one has case mix, demographic and size of hospital.  Some hospitals take on very hard cases, so therefore one would expect to see a higher rate of claims.  Maternity units obviously have higher incidences of compensation rather than volumes of claim.  Then there is the issue that one might raise undue concerns among the public no matter what context one puts around it.  There might be a perception, wrongly, that a hospital is not one a person might go to, and there are consequences for the system if people decide they will not attend hospital A as well as for the reputation of both the hospital and the practitioners.  Those are just some of the reasons.  I am informed by my colleague, Colm Henry, in the HSE that it carries out real quality analysis and publishes it, which is helpful in terms of understanding what is happening in hospitals.<\/p> <p>  In the time since the inception of the State Claims Agency and all the analysis that we do, there have been very few occasions where we have had to take an issue up with a hospital chief executive about a particular practitioner.<\/p><p>That is not to say that we have not done that.  We have, and where we have done that, a hospital addresses the issue.  It might involve nothing more than the association of a practitioner with a cluster of claims.  There might be different factors involved, including difficult cases such as difficult surgeries.  When we come across such a cluster and where we look at the expert evidence, if there is something we need to say to a hospital chief executive, for example, that he or she might have to look at what has been happening in those cases together with the practitioner, we hand the case back to him or her and let him or her deal with it.  We have done that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":168,"content":"<p>The figures are big.

The caveat is written very strongly in the foreword and the introduction that we are not comparing like with like.  A stroke specialist carrying out a thrombectomy, in which a clot is removed from the patient, is going to attract more complex and difficult cases.  A neurosurgery unit will attract cases from other hospitals which deal with less complex cases.<\/p> <p>  When we are looking at quality of healthcare, adverse events are one important component, but there is much more to it.  We have to look at access as well.  Every month we discuss performance management at our hospital groups, looking at access to cancer clinics and healthcare associated infections.  We look at patterns between hospitals and, in some cases, patterns between practitioners.  Our governance structure is set up so that the first port of call is management at local level, meaning the hospital and the hospital group, which are best placed to interpret the data and to put in place improvement plans where they believe they are needed.

One of the lessons from this, which is in Dr. Scally's report, is that we need to strengthen the quality assurance around the process and the inspections.  Another observation that Dr. Scally made was that we need to ensure, as a laboratory-based programme for cervical screening, that we have much stronger laboratory and cytopathology input to the programme than was the case previously.

The critical issue with regard to the HPV project is that in order to run it or to implement the switch over from the current model to the new model - remembering that we use HPV screening now for women who have a low-grade test from cytology to give greater assurance - we must flip the process, for want of a better term, so that 100% are on HPV.  The critical part in that will be the laboratories.  Put simply, we need laboratories to provide a service and the current negotiations that we are concluding, in terms of contracts and so on, will determine the start date.  We cannot provide a start date until those negotiations conclude.  A critical step must be taken between now and Christmas, which has two parts.  As we conclude the contracts, we will be clear on the private laboratories that have the capacity to work with us going forward and on what we can do within the public system.  One of our objectives is to balance the public and private system pieces.  We also intend to run a pre-market process rather than proceeding with a standard procurement.  Given everything that is happening, there is a serious risk in terms of service providers so we intend to do an open, pre-tender market engagement some time towards the end of November or in early December.

One of the issues was the savings recorded.  I looked at the two reports provided by the State Claims Agency.  The 2017 report recorded even bigger savings than a previous report.  Legal costs were reduced by 48% in 2017, while the figure for 2016 was 43%.  However, the chapter of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General notes that the agency recorded savings in a manner that was not in keeping with policy at the time.

I have followed up on this because it is so important.  The view was that we were misinterpreting what the audit was about and that its purpose was to enable the system to learn.  It was not really for the women, although women would ultimately benefit from a better system.  That was part of the reason officials from the National Cancer Screening Service told us that communicating with the women was not their uppermost priority.  The idea was that the audit was an internal learning process.  Am I correct in saying that?<\/p> <p>  Now that the audit process has stopped, I wonder how the system is learning.  I have asked numerous questions and, in fairness to the Minister, he has been straight in stating the Scally report and review processes are ongoing.  How is the National Cancer Screening Service learning now?  It seems to me that there was not much to learn in a sense.  The service was not applying the open disclosure policy and did not treat women as being a fundamental part of the treatment by the service.  These are basic things.  One realises that very quickly and changes one's approach.  Why does the National Cancer Screening Service need to wait so long to reintroduce the audit that is such an essential educational tool?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#S02200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541667600,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Of course it is important that we learn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#S02300","nonspeaker":"Dr. Colm Henry"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":380,"content":"<p>Why has it not been reintroduced?

Not only do we need to learn from what happened but we need to design an audit that is fit for purpose for all three cancer screening programmes.

It involves working back from interval cancers, how we audit interval cancers and how we then determine the way that relates to the original screening result.  That is a core part of the work.  We have put together a group.  I hope we will announce in the coming week or two the appointment as chairperson of an eminent person who has been involved in the world of oncology for some years.  The group will look at all three cancer screening programmes and decide a best practice audit for them.

My question related to the cost of all external reviews or investigations of patient care at University Hospital Galway in the past ten years.

I fully understand Mr. Breen's response as to why it would be difficult to break the information down by hospital.  We do not want to compare general hospitals with regional hospitals or hospitals that provide specialist services.  That could cause a general hospital, which does not provide tertiary care, to be compared with a regional hospital.  I completely understand that, but surely the information can be broken down by specialty.  I am interested in where the predominance of cases is.  Is it in maternity care, cardiac care or cancer care?  Where are those cases concentrated?  If we know that, we can compare like with like, and perhaps classify hospitals as general hospitals, specialist hospitals or hospitals that provide cancer care.  Maybe that is a better way to do it.  We do not want to create undue problems for any hospital.  People can see that it is unfair to compare apples and oranges.  At the same time, we do not want to create circumstances where problems are hidden from public scrutiny because this committee cannot see them.

I want his assurance that he will do that.<\/p> <p>  I will move on to the area of thalidomide.  We have a letter from the Irish Thalidomide Association.  It states: \"Consequently, the SCA role in this Thalidomide litigation is to oppose the interests of the Thalidomide survivors in accordance with its charter to minimise costs, even presumably at the expense of the nation&rsquo;s citizens, where a moral responsibility, at the very least, exists.\"  That is from the letter.  These are not people who have had a very short-term engagement with the State; this goes back some decades.  I completely accept that the State Claims Agency has a remit to make sure that claims are valid, that we minimise costs and that we cut down on the cost of litigation.  We certainly want to get open disclosure in order to get to that point.  This connects with some of the stuff one would see on the 6 p.m. news.  For example, one might see a family coming out, not necessarily in respect of thalidomide, but where there has been a catastrophic failure and a very serious birth defect as a consequence of it.  People will say that this happened nine or ten years ago.  There is no doubt but that the message invariably comes across that there has been a serious contest between the person involved and the State Claims Agency.<\/p><p>Such cases are generally taken on behalf of the person who has been damaged.  What comes across is that there has been an ongoing battle.  The point being made in the letter seems to be that this issue does not only apply to this group but reflects a culture in the State Claims Agency.  I ask Mr. Breen to respond to that and to explain the remit of the State Claims Agency?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#Y02600","speaker":"1226","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541667600,"counter":682,"content":"<p>As I said to Deputy MacSharry earlier, our remit is always to act within our remit, which is to manage litigation against the State, to admit liability where it should be admitted and then to move to compensate people.  As I said, we should neither under-compensate or overcompensate people.<\/p> <p>  I will speak about thalidomide in a moment but I will first address the Deputy's central point that the State Claims Agency is somehow an oppressive organisation to deal with in litigation.  I reassure the Deputy that we are not.  The tort system pits people against each other.  One has a plaintiff and a defendant and the duty on the plaintiff is to prove his or her case on the balance of probabilities test.  What we do in every case is examine the case and look to establish liability and we would be failing in our statutory duty if we did not do so.<\/p> <p>  Equally, there are days when we go down to court where we have previously tried to settle either catastrophic injury cases or other cases for sums that we believe are correct and we have not been able to do so because we have been asked for sums that are multiples of what we had offered.  For example, we settled a case for &euro;75,000, inclusive of costs, where the asking price in that case was &euro;1.8 million and it could not be settled until we reached the steps of the court.  In catastrophic injury cases, we are frequently asked for figures of between &euro;26 million and &euro;30 million.  The State clearly cannot pay out those kind of figures.  The Deputy, as a member of this committee, would scrutinise me on not paying out too much and that is what we are about.  When we do that, sometimes it brings us into the kind of tensions that are naturally associated with plaintiff and defendant.  We can often be mischaracterised as being difficult to deal with.  We try, for example, to use mediation because it is a less adversarial process and we offer it in practically all cases of medical negligence where we know that there is a liability.<\/p> <p>  If I may refer to thalidomide for a second------<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#Z00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen"},{"type":"speech","time":1541667600,"counter":683,"content":"<p>I ask Mr. Breen to be as brief as possible. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018110800002#Z00300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541667600,"counter":684,"content":"<p>I will be brief.

My duty, as director of the agency and having regard to the equality provisions in the Constitution and all the rest, is that if there is a statute of limitations defence, I must put that into our defence.  My duty is to ensure that we treat all our citizens, and other people living in the country who make claims, equally and that we do not do one thing for one group and something else for another.

One of Dr. Scally's specific recommendations was that the current guideline be revised as a matter of urgency.  That was to remove any ambiguity.

That work has already taken place with a view to tying down what rare exceptions there would be to open disclosure if somebody was in danger of causing harm to themselves or other people.  That wording has been done and has to go through a consultative process within the HSE.  It will go to the leadership of the HSE in January.  The next stage is that we have to bear in mind that this is a moving target.  There is the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act, which involves a new type of education and awareness for our staff which is quite significant for them because it gives them protection under the Act when they engage in open disclosure.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a patient safety Bill, which will bring in mandatory open disclosure for serious reported events.  Through this, we have to update the existing policy, knowing that things are changing as we go.  At the same time, we have to enhance and build on the training of staff, with 29,000 currently trained, and will involve an element of retraining and new education in order that they are aware of the legal protections they need and of their legal obligations.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Scally's report refers to a greater overhaul of open disclosure.

The Minister has made a commitment that there will be two patient advocates on boards, which is only right and proper, particularly with regard to the board of the HSE which is being reinstated.  That board should never have been abolished.  In my view, we need to take a different approach to finding such people.  We need to ensure that there is demographic cover provided by patient advocates but that will not be possible if people do not have their wages and costs met.  When one looks at the people affected by some of the scandals, one sees that many are relatively young.  In order for such people to be able to sit on a board, they would have to give up work.  It is not about making money but about making sure that their wages and costs are covered.  We need to think outside the box in this regard.<\/p><p>I ask Mr. McCallion to take back that message to departmental officials.  In fairness, retirees and public servants are fine; we need them.  However, we also need to ensure the the 34 year olds affected - women and men - will have a chance to make a contribution because in so many cases the people affected are in that tier of society, but at this time they cannot make those commitments.  It is impossible for them to do so.

I want to put a couple of things on record to give context.  On 19 May 2009, Dr. Brendan Corcoran, on behalf of the State, signed a contract for the provision of Pandemrix.  In October or November 2009, the State distributed leaflets to patients and a different one to health professionals which claimed that Pandemrix was as safe as the ordinary flu vaccine and that it was clinically tested.  From my research, that statement appears to have been false and has been accepted as false since.  In 2012, Dr. Darina O'Flanagan, the then director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, at the request of the Government, produced a report which found that there was a thirteenfold higher risk of narcolepsy in vaccinated children compared with unvaccinated children, in particular between the ages of five and 19.  The then Minister for Health and now Senator James Reilly stated: \"This report is a start in understanding the association between the vaccine and narcolepsy.  However, our main focus is on the people affected and their families.\"  Last year, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, alluded to the fact that his officials were looking at a compensation scheme for side effects from important vaccines.  The origin of that statement is the steering group on vaccines which goes back to 2001.  The health committee recommended certain things, and the vaccine damage steering group was set up in 2007 and reported in 2009.<\/p><p>Then, as I said, the Minister, Deputy Harris, was saying in 2017 that he was looking at a compensation scheme.  Again, anecdotal evidence would suggest, and I will ask both the Department of Health and perhaps Mr. Breen to answer this, that in some of these 80 cases there has been a delay in discovery of up to two years and that State money in defending that discovery has run to more than &euro;2 million.

I have a British Medical Journal article in front of me on the futility of pharma vigilance if it is not acted upon.  The information was coming in.  GSK would not provide the product without the agency indemnifying it because it did not know.  When we got it in November 2009, or whenever it was, and started to vaccinate, information was coming from GSK to this State within two months telling us it was noting side effects.  That was up to 2012.  That is not Marc MacSharry or somebody who has an axe to grind to facilitate the payment of State funds to 80 families who is saying that.

Of course, we all and I personally have great respect for them, but we should also acknowledge that those efforts are now paying off.  <br\/><br\/>Ten years after the start of the global financial crisis, the euro economy is performing well.  It has been doing so for some time.  We have now seen 22 consecutive quarters of economic growth, while over 9.2 million jobs have been created.  The unemployment rate has declined to 8.1%, its lowest level since November 2008.  The Irish economy has seen particularly strong expansion in recent years.  It is now growing at the fastest pace of any euro area country.  The rate of unemployment has been falling too and now stands well below the euro area average.  It is all the more impressive, given the severe crisis Ireland went through and the legacies with which it is dealing, including high private debt and arrears.  <br\/><br\/>Looking ahead, while some sector specific data and selected survey results have been somewhat weaker than expected, the latest incoming information also suggests the broad based expansion in the euro area, including Ireland, is set to continue.  Against this background, the rate of inflation in the euro area is expected to continue to converge towards the ECB's objective of being below or close to 2% in the medium term.  Getting to this point has required considerable monetary policy support.  The euro area is looking back on several years of exceptionally low interest rates and what we call unconventional monetary policy measures.  The ECB's key interest rates have been at unprecedented low levels since 2009 and supported by a series of unconventional measures introduced in the face of a protracted recession and persistently low inflation.  While we are now at the point where we anticipate, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will end net asset purchases at the end of the year, a significant monetary stimulus will still be needed to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below but close to 2% in the medium term.  However, even after we end our net asset purchases, a monetary stimulus will continue to be provided by the guidance we have given, namely, we expect key interest rates to continue at their current level, at least through the summer of 2019, and to maintain the stock of assets on our balance sheet by reinvesting maturing bonds purchased under the asset purchase programme for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases.  <br\/><br\/>The overall favourable outlook and our still accommodative stance should not invite complacency.  Although, on the whole, the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook can still be assessed as broadly balanced, the risks related to protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility remain prominent.  More specifically, we see a growing willingness to question multilateralism which has underpinned global growth since the end of the Second World War.  The protectionist trade measures implemented may have had very limited effects thus far, but the escalation of trade tensions is certainly undermining confidence.<\/p><p> The financial stability environment in the euro area overall remains favourable, but it has become somewhat more challenging in recent months.  The results of the European stress test published last Friday show that euro area banks are increasingly resilient to financial shocks.  This also reflects the continuing economic expansion, which has strengthened private and public balance sheets alike.  Still, there are risks.  These include liquidity risks in the non-bank financial sector that could be transmitted to the broader financial system.  Developments in this area should be closely monitored, and the regulatory and supervisory framework for non-banks needs to be strengthened.<\/p><p> Asset prices also require close monitoring.  While there is no compelling evidence at this stage of overstretched asset valuations at the euro area level, we are seeing some localised risks.  However, euro area monetary policy is not the appropriate tool with which to address such risks.  They call instead for targeted macroprudential policies, which can be tailored to local and sectoral conditions.  The recent decisions by the Central Bank of Ireland are an example of how macroprudential policy can promote financial stability.<\/p><p> The other risk in our minds is, of course, Brexit.  With negotiations ongoing and less than five months to go until the United Kingdom&rsquo;s departure from the European Union, it is essential to prepare for all outcomes, including a no-deal scenario.  While the direct trade effects of a hard Brexit would be limited for the euro area as a whole, Ireland is more exposed due to its very close trade relations with the UK.  We also see limited overall risks to euro area financial stability.  Without sufficient mitigating action, however, a cliff-edge Brexit could have an adverse impact in certain areas of centrally cleared derivatives markets.<\/p><p> Sources of risk from outside the EU have increased since May.  A stronger US dollar and heightened trade tensions triggered renewed stress in a number of emerging market economies.<\/p><p> Thanks to our collective efforts at the European and national level, we have come a long way since the start of the financial crisis.  However, to strengthen our economies and preserve financial stability, we need to go further.<\/p><p> Let me highlight in particular some of the concrete steps in the area of financial integration that we need to take at the European level.  First, we need to complete the architecture of the banking union.  The benefits of having a euro area supervisor are clear when we look at banks&rsquo; strengthened balance sheets.  However, more needs to be done to reduce the risks for citizens as both taxpayers and depositors, and to break the remaining link between banks and national governments.  In addition to the adoption of a banking package which is currently under negotiation among EU legislators, a genuine banking union needs further regulatory harmonisation, for instance through greater reliance on regulations instead of directives.  In particular, unwarranted national options and discretions still stand in the way of a level playing field for banks.  At the same time, we need to establish a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and lay the groundwork for the creation of an effective European deposit insurance scheme.  Making significant steps in these areas is a precondition for a truly integrated euro area banking system and single money.<\/p><p> The second thing we need to do is build a true single market in capital.  To be robust, the capital markets union needs effective regulation and supervision, for example with investment firms and clearing.  Not least given the United Kingdom's imminent departure from the European Union, we need to make concrete progress on this agenda and complement it with an ambitious, long-term vision.<\/p><p> Recent Eurobarometer data show that support for the euro stands at a record high of 77% among euro area citizens and a large majority believe that their country&rsquo;s membership of the EU is a good thing.  Support for the European project is particularly strong in Ireland, where with 88% of citizens the single currency enjoys the highest level of support in the Union.  Europe has to repay this trust.<\/p><p> We face important global challenges that are naturally causing concern among the people of Europe, especially those who feel left behind.  Common institutions and collaboration among member states give Europe a strong voice in the world.  More important, they make it possible for us to find effective answers to joint problems; we are stronger together.  I thank members for their attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1394,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Draghi - c&eacute;ad mile f&aacute;ilte.

This does not mean that we are not monitoring what is happening.  We support the Commission with technical advice in our remit.  As the Senator may know, upon the joint initiative of the European Commission and the UK Treasury, a working group between the Bank of England and the ECB is being created.  We have been told that we cannot overstep the main negotiators.  The working group has identified various areas but has not yet proceeded or been instructed to exactly explain what ought to be done.<\/p> <p>  The impact on the Irish economy is both direct, through trade, and indirect, through financial channels.  It is direct in that the banks and all the financial systems are highly interconnected with the UK financial system.  It is also indirect in the sense that the Irish financial and banking system finances firms that also operate in the United Kingdom.  The impact is bound to be significant.  We can certainly discuss the various channels and we will be in a better position to know this once the outcome is clear.<\/p><p>One thing I said in the European Parliament is that the European Union will stand behind Ireland.  It will back Ireland.  That is quite important in the sense of counting on the closeness and the solidarity of the rest of the EU.<\/p><p> The area where we have identified risk is that of centrally cleared derivatives but, as I said on another occasion, there must be a considerable degree of mismanagement for this risk to materialise.  All in all, this seems to me unlikely.  In other words, the authorities on both sides will be able to manage these risks in such a way that financial stability would be preserved.  The exact ways in which these mitigating actions will be taken will be clear only when we know the outcome of the negotiation.  That is why we have been inviting private sector parties, especially on the European side, to take all the mitigating action they can themselves without necessarily waiting for public intervention, because we do not know the outcome yet.<\/p><p> All in all, my perception is that things can be managed.  However, if the private sector at some point were to decide there is going to be a cliff edge or an unmanaged process, then the private sector's behaviours could be a source of instability, which is something we have to monitor very closely.<\/p><p> I was asked my view of what is going to happen.

My time is limited so I will get to the point.  I want to raise two issues.  The first relates to the transmission of monetary policy to the end consumer.  As Mr. Draghi knows, in Ireland the end consumer pays very high interest rates on debt.  For example, in regard to mortgages, the latest official statistics show the average interest rate paid in Ireland on new mortgages drawn down in the month of August was 3.15%, whereas the average across the eurozone was 1.77%, so there is a massive difference of 1.38%, or 138 basis points in Mr. Draghi's language.  Mortgage holders, businesses, farmers and other Irish consumers are paying very high interest rates.  One of the purposes of Mr. Draghi's monetary policy was to stimulate the economies throughout the eurozone, but low interest rates are not being passed on to the end consumers in Ireland.  Has Mr. Draghi a view on that?  What can be done to try to reduce interest rates in Ireland and bring them more in line with rates charged elsewhere in the eurozone?<\/p> <p>  The second issue is in regard to the asset purchase programme, which, as Mr. Draghi said, will come to an end at the end of this year.  According to its publications, the ECB has purchased just under &euro;30 billion of Irish Government bonds since 2015, which accounts for about 23% of our national debt in the form of Government bonds, and there is other debt as well.  What does Mr. Draghi think the impact will be on peripheral countries like Ireland of the unwinding of that programme?  We have about &euro;50 billion of our national debt to be refinanced over the next five years.  The concern is that sovereign borrowing costs will increase significantly for countries like Ireland as the ECB unwinds the quantitative easing programme and stops buying new debt.  Only a few years ago, 13% of general Government revenue in Ireland was used to pay the interest on the national debt.  That has now fallen to 6% to 7% but it is a key risk for the Irish economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#D00700","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1403,"content":"<p>I am aware lending rates by banks to users, be they consumers or mortgage holders, are high.  However, one should ask why they are high.  The evidence seems to say it is because the banking market is not competitive and there are monopoly or quasi-monopoly situations here.  The way to address this is twofold.  First, it requires actions to reduce the degree of monopoly and actions to increase the competition among banks and, by the way, other non-bank institutions that may finance the economy.  The second way is basically what the EU is doing to complete banking union and to give a convincing signal to create a genuine capital market so that cross-bank lending, cross-bank purchases and master netting agreements, MNAs, across countries can be undertaken so as to increase the competition.  Although it might take me too much time and the Deputy might not approve, we can discuss the benefits of creating a capital market union that would go well beyond the fact that interest rates would go down and borrowers would be in better condition.  These are the two types of actions.<\/p> <p>  As to what can be done at EU level, as I said in my introductory statement, we must try to harmonise the legislation and regulations in different countries, which, by the way, are considered the main barrier to cross-country bank lending.  For example, there are different regimes for mortgages across different countries which prevents cross-country lending.  Second, countries must take domestic actions geared to increasing competition.<\/p> <p>  The second point is about whether our anticipation of ending the net asset purchase programme will create an increase in interest rates on sovereign debt.  The answer is that we do not think so.  We expect our monetary policy to stay very accommodative, even after the end of the net asset purchase programme, because of our formal guidance on interest rates, when we said interest rates will stay at the present level, at least through the summer of 2019.  In these years we have accumulated a very sizeable stock of bonds and will continue reinvesting in these bonds as they come due for an extended period of time.<\/p><p>As I always remind people, we keep a lot of optionality in our message and monetary policy guidance.  If things were to get worse, we could always extend the period and change our forward guidance consistently with the incoming information.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#D00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1405,"content":"<p>I thank President Draghi and come back on one point regarding the interest rates charged to consumers in Ireland.  If I heard him correctly, he described the situation here as one of quasi-monopoly, which is a fair statement.  Between them, the two pillar banks in Ireland hold approximately 60% of the mortgage market.  Competition is limited and we would like to see new entrants join the Irish market.  There are opportunities but while there is speculation about engagement with our Central Bank, nothing is confirmed.  I emphasise to President Draghi again that with each passing month and each monthly repayment, Irish mortgage holders pay so much more than citizens with comparable loans elsewhere in the eurozone.  As such, his monetary policy is not being transmitted to where it matters, namely to the households of consumers.  I ask him to consider ways in which he and our Central Bank can help to impose downward pressure on interest rates in Ireland for the benefit of consumers to bring them more into line with the normal situation elsewhere in the eurozone.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#E00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1406,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Mr. Draghi, Professor Lane agus Johannes Lindner.  The Irish people have paid a huge price for bailing out the Irish banking system and the ECB played a very negative role in that regard.  Some would say it played a very sinister role in increasing the costs to them.  The refusal at the time of the ECB to support the Government's desire to burn senior bondholders has cost them dearly.  Even now, the State is being forced to dispose of the floating bonds associated with the odious debt of Anglo Irish Bank at a cost to the Irish people.  A decade on, homeowners struggling with their debts and those who are or who have been on arrears are seeing their loans being sold off to vulture funds.  When we speak to the banks, they tell us they have to do this as a result of ECB rules.  This is a morally unbearable position.  Mr. Draghi's colleagues are on record saying the ECB has no preference as to how NPLs are dealt with as long as they are dealt with.  What is Mr. Draghi's definition of a \"non-performing loan\" given that our banks appear to have different definitions depending on which one speaks to?<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to an ECB rate rise at a future date.  As my colleague said, Irish consumers are paying twice the EU mortgage interest rate average, which is unacceptable.  Irish businesses, farmers and mortgage holders are having to bear that.  Together with Deputy Michael McGrath, I have published legislation to enable the Central Bank to intervene to deal with a market failure and cap interest rates.  The ECB does not support that concept, however.  Can the ECB lift the restriction or tell us how we should deal with such a situation and protect our citizens given where we are?  Does Mr. Draghi share the view of many in Ireland that the Anglo Irish Bank debt is odious and should no longer be a burden on the people?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#E00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1407,"content":"<p>That is more than two questions but I will try to do my best in the time available.  I will dispense with the first question, which was the Deputy's reconstruction of the past.  We can discuss that but I note that the ECB was not entirely negative, surely.  Things are going well today.  It means the policy advice given in the past was not entirely wrong after all.  It is true that much of the progress we have seen today is due to Irish citizens.  However, the policy advice was not entirely wrong.<\/p> <p>  Second, the ECB has supported Ireland quite a lot.  The liquidity support the ECB provided during the five worst years of the crisis was unprecedented and, in my understanding, it is still unprecedented.  It was 100% of Irish GDP at &euro;140 billion.  More generally, there may be other questions about the past and after all I see this conversation between us as a way to mend a relationship which has been fraught in circumstances of several divergences and many disagreements in the past.  In preparing for this conversation, I asked myself how correct it is today to judge past events when many things have changed in the interim.  That addresses the Deputy's first point but I am sure we can come back to it.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked if we pressed banks to dispose of their NPL stocks in a fire sale and the answer is \"No\".  We have guidance for that.  There is guidance for all banks in the EU.  In some countries, including mine, NPLs are at high levels for different reasons.  In Ireland, they are high because of the original crisis in the construction sector and because of the recession.  In Italy, they are high because of the recession.  What we see today is that the number of NPLs is decreasing without even too much pressure from the ECB.  It is simply because the recovery is so buoyant that it allows for the disposal of NPLs at terms and conditions which are, by and large, okay.  However, we have to distinguish two types of non-performing borrower.  One has the strategic non-performing borrower and then the non-performing borrower who is unable to repay because he or she is too poor.  One has the social problems that come out of that.  In that case, however, the problem ought to be addressed through the right instrument.  That could be social policy.  It should not be addressed by destroying the culture of payment between banks and borrowers.  I see great scope for countries in which NPLs are a social issue to address that with the proper tool.  I am not ignoring the problem at all.  It is a serious problem in many countries.  The EBA has a definition of \"non-performing loan\", which is one that is 90 days due.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made the same point on interest rates and the answer there is increased competition.  This action can come from two sources, namely the domestic government and the European Union.  Any support one can express in the EU to move forward on harmonising legislation is especially delicate but the issue has to be resolved.  We have been discussing this for years now.  The insolvency laws are an example.  If we have different insolvency legislation in different countries, banks will always hesitate to lend money in jurisdictions where they do not know what the insolvency law will be.  That is one of the many actions.  Certainly, things have improved with the creation of a single supervisor.  Progress has been made but it is admittedly much slower than I would like.  I have been saying the same things for years now.<\/p> <p>  Finally, the Deputy asked about the Anglo Irish Bank debt issue.  We can discuss it in more detail, but I note for now that the eurozone treaties cannot accept monetary financing.  That is a case of monetary financing, basically.  This is just the bottom line of very complex reasoning.  The Government created bonds to recapitalise a bank and these bonds are in a portfolio in the Central Bank of Ireland.  They pay out interest.  If one does nothing and does not sell, that interest goes back to the Government, which means financing takes place at zero cost.  That is not possible given the treaties.  Article 123 prohibits monetary financing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi"},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1408,"content":"<p>The reality is those bondholders should have been burnt and the ECB did not support the Government when a Cabinet decision was taken to burn senior bondholders.

Ten years after 2008, does the ECB admit errors in its own conduct after the crash?  The IMF, one of the ECB's sister organisations, did and published new guidelines.  What of the ECB, not least in its conduct in Ireland, where it was probably the most rigid and most conservative of all three troika members?  I appreciate Mr. Draghi was not president then.  We are all aware Mr. Draghi did not make threats about bombs going off in Dublin.  However, Mr. Draghi's tenure of the bank is passing.  While he might be described as something of a Keynesian, and all the better for it, I am not so sure about his successors.<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Draghi about effective housing market failure which is a real threat to our democracies, here in Ireland and in many European countries.  Does Mr. Draghi recognise that effective housing market failure is happening in a number of European countries?  People and families on low incomes or state support are struggling to get affordable rent or to pay it, or to buy or lease a home long-term, which has been a hallmark of European economic progress over a long time.  Mr. Draghi referenced a 2% inflation rate.  It is a bit low.  It might be better if it was approximately 3% and that was reflected in higher wages, particularly for those on low pay.  Those on low wages who cannot get housing are the so-called left behind that Mr. Draghi referred to in his opening remarks.  Mr. Draghi also talked about the slogan, \"Stronger together.\"  In Gaelic, in Ireland, there is a similar phrase, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Can Mr. Draghi give expression to the fine sentiments in his opening remarks that might give hope to those who do not have houses, who do not have affordable rents, and who do not have a job which pays a decent amount of money and gives them some security?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#F00700","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1415,"content":"<p>Deputy Burton asks a lot from the ECB.  Our policy has now kept the interest rates at such a low level for an unprecedented period of time.  We complemented this policy with the purchases of assets, both Government and private corporate bond assets.  In a sense, it has been a policy that has helped debtors and helped entrepreneurs.  It helped the private sector, helped Governments, and to the extent that it engineered the recovery, it also helped banks, insurance companies and pension funds which complain a lot about low rates.  They should complain less, thinking that if the recovery had not taken place, the exposure of the banks would have been much higher, the NPLs would be much higher, and there would be many more clients who would not be able to pay back.  This policy is now producing a concrete result.<\/p> <p>  As I stated at the beginning, the economy is improving everywhere.  The main drivers are consumption and investment this year more than exports.  Last year, it was more exports.  In my view, there are two most important data.  The first is the employment data.  The number of jobs created, as I stated, is 9.2 million.  There were never so many jobs being created in five years in the European Union.  The second is the dispersion.  At the beginning of the crisis, we had countries which were doing relatively well and countries which were not doing well at all, and the dispersion in growth rates was high.  Currently, the dispersion is at the lowest level historically.  That also gives a sense of comfort.  This has been achieved through low rates.<\/p> <p>  Often we are told that our asset purchases are benefiting those who own assets, namely, the wealthy part of the population.  As a matter of fact, we went through a quite elaborate search here trying to assess the distributional effects of our policies.  Certainly, asset prices go up and assets are, by and large, owned by rich people, but also there is the reduction in unemployment.  The most important cause for income and wealth inequality is unemployment.  The two effects offset each other and, by and large, the monetary policies being pursued have not increased and if anything, have improved distribution.  Also, one must consider that gain has two sides.  The increase in the value of houses has improved mostly the low-income house owners in many countries.  Specifically here, there are issues that the ECB cannot do much about because there are the sorts of constraints to supply that constrain the housing market.  This is my understanding.  These constraints, however, are getting less and less bidding, if I understand well, in that construction supply is increasing.  All in all, we should be waiting for less price pressures on housing.  It is also true that, thanks to the recovery, demand is also buoyant in the housing market.  All in all, our policy has helped people.<\/p> <p>  One of the parameters we always look at is exactly what Deputy Burton mentioned, namely, wages and what is happening to nominal wages.  We look at that because, for us, it is the best predictor of inflation which is our objective and is in our mandate.  Data in the past six to 12 months show that wages are gradually going up.<\/p><p>They are not going up because of temporary effects but more and more because of permanent effects.  Wages in Germany and in the euro area have been going up.  In Ireland it is 2.5% which is slightly higher than the euro area average and certainly higher than in many other countries.  It has been a big crisis and it has taken a long time to get out of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1417,"content":"<p>Sometimes the next crisis arises from the failure to deal with the current crisis which may not be as big as 2008.

In the past seven years there has been a lot of evidence to prove that the European Central Bank has been playing a fundamentally undemocratic role in the service of bankers as opposed to in the service of ordinary people.  That ranges from its role in the removal of elected governments in Italy and in Greece in November 2011 and its role in foisting European bankers' debt on people in this country, for which we are still seeing billions of euros burned by the Central Bank of Ireland on an annual basis as a consequence of that, and it includes the strangulation of the Greek banking system in 2015 in order to try to ensure an outcome of a democratic referendum.<\/p> <p>  I return to that question today and ask how Mr. Draghi defends the role the European Central Bank has played over the course of the past decade and its fundamentally undemocratic character and does he intend for that kind of role to continue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#G00800","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1424,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy because he makes the ECB seem very powerful and more powerful than it is.  Removing governments is not the task of the ECB but it is the task of the voters of the different countries which elect them.  It is the task of parliaments but certainly not that of the ECB.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is referring to the fact that under certain conditions the ECB cannot continue to support a country through bond purchases or the provision of emergency liquidity assistance, which is a decision of the national central bank by the way and not of the ECB.  The ECB has rules.  It lends money against collateral to solvent banks.  If banks are not solvent the ECB cannot lend money.  If the collateral quality drops below a certain level, that collateral can no longer be accepted and often this collateral is formed by government bonds.  To the extent that the policy of a certain country affects the value of these government bonds, the policy of a country becomes important for maintaining the support of the ECB.  That has been the rule according to which the ECB has behaved in the many instances the Deputy mentioned.  Of course the relationship between different countries and liquidity support can take different shapes but the substance of it amounts to what I have said before.  The policy affects the quality of the collateral and the collateral is fundamental to maintaining the liquidity support but it is not that the ECB wants to dictate a policy.<\/p> <p>  By the way, in answer to a previous question I was asked, I should say that recently the ECB has been carving a different role out for itself in the policy dialogue with countries.  It is much more limited to the financial stability part of the policy dialogue, unless it is extended to other parts such as the fiscal part.  In other words, it is concerned with the financial stability and it is only concerned with fiscal sustainability only insofar as it affects financial stability.  The ECB will not talk about different structures and operations or other such issues which we used to do in the past in the early versions of the Troika.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#G00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi"},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1425,"content":"<p>I do not agree with Mr. Draghi's assessment of what the ECB has done.

That letter was from Mr. Trichet, the then head of the European Central Bank, and it was very clear about threatening the withdrawal of emergency liquidity assistance and one day after, the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, who sits on the governing council, went on the radio without informing the Government to announce that a bailout would be needed.

Our national debt for 2018 is approximately &euro;205 billion.  Percentage wise, it is somewhere in the mid-60s in terms of our GDP ratio.  The amount of our national budget required to service that debt is quite significant.  In 2007-2008, it was just over 3% and peaked at around 15%.  Twenty-five per cent of our national debt is made up of banking debt in terms of rescuing the banking system.  How aware is Mr. Draghi of how vulnerable we are in terms of that liability on our balance sheet?  In his view, what are the implications of the asset management programme coming to an end?<\/p> <p>  Second, &euro;500 million from the budget and &euro;1.5 billion from our investment bank was put into a rainy day fund established by our Government this year.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council made a point about the fiscal rules being unable to deal with the countercyclical nature by which a rainy day fund would be deployed.  In other words, when it comes to spending the money in that fund, the fiscal rules are imperfect in terms of dealing with that.

I understand the budget discussions taking place in this committee are showing that the improvement continues.  The draft budget plan foresees a balanced budget in 2019 and, for the first time since 2007, there will be a fiscal surplus in 2020 and beyond.  Given the current buoyant economy, it is time to rebuild fiscal buffers.  That is the best way to deal with the incoming risk we mentioned previously, namely, overheating and possibly Brexit.

My understanding is that here SMEs have a hard time getting credit because of the presence of a monopoly or quasi-monopoly.  There are probably other parameters like the default history of the economy and probability of default, which leads to increasing difficulty in giving credit to small and medium enterprises.  This will wash out with the recovery, as the probability of default will go down and the amount of credit being offered should naturally increase.  The big limitation here is the presence of a monopoly, which should be dealt with.  There is a natural way of doing this, which is to wait, but that is slow, so if the Government can take action to reduce the degree of monopoly, it would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#J00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi"},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1456,"content":"<p>Is there any specific action that Mr. Draghi recommends?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#J00700","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1457,"content":"<p>No.  Each country has its own.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi"},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1458,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Draghi.

I put it to Mr. Draghi that we must learn from history and our mistakes.  At one session here we had an employee from an Italian bank, Mr. Jonathan Sugarman, and I know Mr. Draghi is familiar with him.  The case was put in the European Parliament by Mr. Luke \"Ming\" Flanagan and perhaps others.  It was never seen that Mr. Sugarman was acknowledged in any way for bringing forward the serious wrong-doings in that bank.  Nobody knows publicly whether it was addressed.  For all and sundry looking at this, it appears the honest whistleblower working with appropriate legislation and reporting a bank with sizable difficulties was ignored.<\/p> <p>  The issue of bondholders was raised.  Bondholders are in the business of taking risk and they apply an interest rate based on the kind of risk they take.  Why would they not be burned, or at least a certain number of them?  We are talking about Irish banks and we can see their profitability today.  It will perhaps be &euro;1.5 billion in two cases when the final figures come out.  They are certainly at a high level of profitability.  I acknowledge we have had help from Europe and the argument is that we must repay that trust.  The question now is if there is a policy of \"together we are stronger\", we must consider the people.  We must go beyond the institutions that the Government in Ireland, both at that time and since, as well as the EU have helped.  We must consider how to help the individual citizen in these states.<\/p> <p>  Our immediate problem is that the banks are almost outside of control, I am afraid to say.  They are making their money and selling non-performing loans while blaming Europe for that.  They are selling to vulture funds that are not regulated.  I understand from a recent exchange with some European Union officials that it intends to introduce a form of regulation similar to what we have in Ireland, which is essentially light-touch regulation for vulture funds.  Meanwhile, ordinary Irish citizens and others living in this country are being thrown out of their homes.  Thousands of acres of Irish agricultural land is now held by vulture funds.  As a result of what happened way back then, we are still paying a price.  We speak about the recovery and we have seen a certain amount of recovery going on around us but it has not benefitted a significant number of people who are still finding it difficult to put their lives back together again.<\/p> <p>  There are Central Bank rules about credit and reporting and this has affected the ability of small businesses to raise money.  Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty and others have raised the question of the interest rates.  Mr. Draghi has argued interest rates are a function of the banking market, with rates being reduced according to competition.  There is so much bad debt in banks arising from the crash that they will not reduce rates.  They could do it because of the amount of money they make but we can see them throwing people out of their homes and dragging them, kicking and screaming, through the courts in Ireland.  No society should tolerate that.<\/p> <p>  We look to the Central Bank and the European Central Bank to acknowledge in some way the plight of ordinary people faced with difficulties in their lives.  They are part of the European Union and they deserve to be recognised and supported by the Union and the Irish Government.  It is a real difficulty here that there is no competition between banks because of what happened in the past and the interest rates are not right because of that.  People in their homes are now being threatened because of past events and the system seems to want to ignore them.  It would be unfair not to bring all of that to Mr. Draghi's attention today.  The European Central Bank may not have the power to deal with all that but I must say to Mr. Draghi on behalf of the people I represent that they are not experiencing as much of a recovery as the European Union tells them is happening.  It is not happening.  The banks here are a disgrace.<\/p> <p>  I am sure Mr. Draghi is familiar with the tracker mortgage issue.  It is outrageous how banks ripped off the ordinary people in this country who were their customers but they are still dragging their heels to this day, refusing to recognise the plight of people and the position in which they have put people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#J01000","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1541689800,"counter":1460,"content":"<p>Thank you.  The Chairman raised many issues but the ECB cannot do much about most of them.  Again, our duty is to go with our mandate and try to deliver it.  We are doing this with our monetary policy and interest rates that are as low as they have ever been.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned non-performing loans, NPLs, and the ECB is not pushing that disposal.  There is a dialogue that is going very well between banks and the ECB all over the eurozone about disposal of NPLs.  The Chairman mentioned that if these NPLs did not stay on the balance sheet of banks, they could lower their lending rates because costs would be lower.  In a quasi-monopoly or monopoly position, if costs are lowered, it would also be possible to lower rates.  We said before that disposal of NPLs is not a simple matter, and it is not simple from a social viewpoint either because many of the NPLs are with people who cannot pay.  They are poorer people.  That social problem should be addressed with social or budgetary measures rather than interfering with the interest rate-setting mechanism, as that would probably sometimes undermine banks' stability.<\/p><p>That is the first rough answer that I feel like giving.<\/p><p> More specifically, I am grateful for the question on Mr. Sugarman.  There is a good opportunity for me to say everything about that.  I already discussed this matter in a written answer to a Member of the European Parliament, Mr. Flanagan, dated 22 December 2016.  This letter is published on the ECB's website, so if people want to know, they can look at that.<\/p><p> The case of UniCredit, which the Chairman raised in line with the established principle of separation between monetary policy and banking supervision, falls in the competence of the chair of the ECB supervisory board, Dani&egrave;le Nouy.  I cannot comment on supervisory measures taken with respect to an individual bank.  I will address the Chairman's questions by first clarifying what powers the ECB banking supervision has to address breaches by significant banks.  We have a variety of supervisory tools at hand, including sanctioning powers.  I will save the committee from the list of all the powers that we have because it is a long list, but I reassure members that in my previous capacity as governor of Banca d'Italia, I was never notified of the issue the Chairman raised.  I understand, as was stated publicly before this Parliament, that the Central Bank of Ireland carried out an in-depth investigation into this case and considers the matter to be closed.  It has been discussed, it is on the website, everything has been done and measures have been taken.  I cannot comment on the specific measures.  As the governor of the other side of the bank, I was not notified and did not know anything.  The Central Bank of Ireland fully inquired and declared the matter to be closed.<\/p><p> I completely agree that we have to look at people.  We are doing that in pursuing our mandate to the best of our ability.<\/p><p> Vulture funds are a big development in the euro area.  The size of the EU non-banks financial sector increased on average by 83% annually between 2012 and 2015.  Bond funds, which the committee calls vulture funds, have increased liquidity transformation, credit and interest rate risk taken.  The European exchange-traded fund sector remains small compared with traditional mutual funds, but further regulatory work is needed.  Until recently, people used to say that since the non-banking sector does not have deposits, it is different from banks and does not need to be regulated.  This is not true any longer.  These non-banks do exactly the same things as banks.  They finance the economy, take deposits and give credit.  They are very interconnected with other institutions.  They deserve to be regulated.  The ECB recommended that this work would proceed further and especially that macroprudential tools would be extended to the non-banking sector, including what the Chairman mentioned before, the vulture funds.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018110800002#J01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Mario Draghi","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541689800,"counter":1462,"content":"<p>I accept what Mr. Draghi says about Mr. Sugarman and the complaint that he made.  It may be closed but arising from that complaint and what happened, nobody went to jail and nobody is being pursued.  We are constantly told that the regulations are being strengthened but the citizens that we represent, Jonathan Sugarman, and I do not see it that way.  While we measure things here with regard to the financial circumstances of the country and the European Union, the social devastation caused in Ireland by the crash and the vulture funds is horrific.  It continues to this day and it is wrong to say that we are experiencing a recovery.  We are not.  Certain parts of the country are but a vast number of people are still caught in the courts, trying to deal with the banks.  Their homes are being taken from them.  There may be a need for a social policy but the consequences of the financial policies are causing all of this to happen.  While Mr. Draghi says the vulture funds should be regulated, between now and the time they are regulated, people will have died by suicide.  That has happened in this country.  People will have lost their homes and we continue to burn money in the Central Bank every month.  I think it is wrong that a bank or institution which represents the people of the European Union would not at least flex its muscle and say that the social consequences are too much and that countries need to intervene.  The European Central Bank should in some way tell the banks in Ireland, through Professor Lane at the Central Bank, that they will not get away with it any more.  They continue to get away with it.<\/p> <p>  Community banking has been mentioned.  Credit unions and community banking should be given a special place to perform.  That type of business structure has saved people on the lower end of the ladder, borrowing small amounts from credit unions and banks such as Sparkasse.  The only place in which one can get money for the small and medium enterprise sector in Ireland is from the funds which are charging astronomical rates for it.  They are engaging with people around the country, providing loans and creating further risk for the economic development of Ireland.  I have to say that about those I have engaged with and their experiences.<\/p> <p>  We have been joined by Deputy Eamon Ryan who asked me for a few minutes earlier.

One of our pillar banks, AIB, had to be rescued by the State in the middle of the financial crash, which took 100% equity.  Two or three years ago, the Government sold in an initial public offering, a quarter of the stock at a price of &euro;4.40 per share.  The shares today are trading at a 10% discount on that.  The bank recently lost its CEO and CFO.  I know the European Central Bank does not get involved in micromanagement but this is not a small issue with regard to what strategy this State should pursue with the ownership of such a bank.  Are we better retaining it in public ownership?  How do we manage that situation?  It would be hard to issue a share price below what we issued two years ago.  The bank has a long history and important record in this country.  As Mr. Draghi says, it is in a market where the whole world is changing.

He is responsible for the supervision of Europe's banks.  Unfortunately his job is to protect the banks and not the people.  For example, many of us are very concerned that the European Central Bank, ECB, has always relied on the Single Supervisory Mechanism statute to shift responsibility for any kind of protection for consumers and distressed borrowers to the national competent authorities, which in my view often fail to ensure that protection.  Mr. Draghi will be familiar with the tracker mortgage scandal, for example.  <\/p><p> The ECB says that another bailout of the banks should never be needed.  I would like to put it to Mr. Draghi that there is an ongoing bailout of Irish banks.  He will be aware of the exorbitant interest rates they charge, which have been mentioned several times today.  Is he aware that the banks here do not have to pay any tax for up to 20 years?  They have been given political permission to sell bad loans rather than work through them.  Tax breaks like the help-to-buy scheme have been introduced to keep the price of houses, and therefore mortgages, up.  Rural communities have seen their banking services closed down with no comment from the Central Bank or the Government.  It is the Irish people who pay for this ongoing bailout in higher interest rates, their loans being sold to vultures and denial of banking services.  Mr. Draghi has the facts now.  He can see the pattern.

The president of the ECB does not comment on supervisory issues.  The Senator said that I am its head.  Yes, technically and legally that is true but in fact we never comment, because we do not want to pollute or confuse the two areas of monetary policy and supervision.  Second, many of the issues Senator Gavan mentioned have to do with misconduct.  To this extent, they really pertain to the area of consumer protection.  As such, they do not really pertain to what the ECB or the supervisory area of the ECB can do.  It is not in our remit.<\/p> <p>  Third, this question, and many others, concerns the social consequences of a banking system which, as I said before, is in a monopoly or quasi-monopoly situation or performed badly during the financial crisis.  To the extent that is possible, of course the rules should be devised so that the banking system is stable and provides credit to the real economy and not just to the financial sector.  However, the first and foremost instrument that governments have to deal with all of these social problems is social policy.  The two areas should be kept separate, at least to the extent that is possible.  One intervenes with the best instrument to achieve the objective in the most effective way.  If there are socially distressed borrowers, there should be a social policy intervention.

I am sure he will be raising this on Report Stage as well as he has related amendments.  I will say a word about the section and my approach to it.<\/p> <p>  On the section itself, a partial repayment of VRT has been available since 1993 on certain vehicles acquired by vehicle leasing or hiring businesses or for providing driving lessons.  This repayment reflects the VRT charged on the VAT element of the vehicle and currently represents 18.7% of the full VRT charge.<\/p> <p> This repayment is a legacy from 1993, when vehicle excise duty was being replaced by the VRT to ease the transition for car leasing and hire companies by ensuring their costs did not increase under the new VRT regime.  This repayment can no longer be justified as a tax expenditure which is not available to other sectors and in the context of typical VRT charges having reduced very substantially since the introduction of the CO2-based VRT charging in 2008.<\/p> <p>  I have decided that the repayment will not be available for vehicles registered on or after 1 January 2019.  However, until 1 April 2019, it will be possible to make claims for vehicles registered up to and including 31 December 2018.<\/p> <p>  I will make two broad points about this.  First, When I became Minister for Finance, the main piece of work I asked my Department to do was to come back to me with tax and policy changes that were made across the period of our greatest economic difficulty that were no doubt justified then - we will begin debating another one of these measures later on this morning or tonight - in order for me to reassess them now in the light of where we are now.  If we do not do this now we are going to end up with a tax code that is full of exemptions and changes that were made at a time that they were needed, and we will not be able to do something similar when we face another need in the future.<\/p> <p>  What I also asked them to do was to come back to me with different matters within our tax code, changes made even before the crash period that are still there.<\/p> <p>  This is a transitionary agreement for a transitionary policy that has now been in place since 1993.  If we do not become more focused on ensuring that changes that we made when they are needed are re-examined at a time when the need is less, then two things are going to happen.  The first is that our tax base will become narrower and we will only appreciate how narrow it becomes at a time of need again.  The second thing is that interests and groups come looking for changes that at times are justified.  We have to be willing then to hold the line and make the case that if that change was made at a time when it was needed, if the need is no longer there and the time has passed we should be able to undo it.  If we are not willing to do this change by change, then the role of my Department, and the State overall, becomes progressively challenged.  I do not want to see that happening.  I am going to go through all of these changes, both big and small.  This is one of the smaller ones but I believe its time has passed.  We will examine whether it is needed and make a case accordingly.  As to whether it will have an effect, the honest answer is it probably will have an effect on some companies that are involved in this sector.<\/p><p>For example, it may have an effect on the availability of cars and what fleet companies have available.  They should be able to manage this change as the relief has been available for a long time.  We should be clear that, if we are to make changes such as this, we will undo them when the time is right.  The time is now right.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#D00100","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1504,"content":"<p>I agree with the vast majority of what the Minister said.  A tax relief introduced at a certain point in time should always be automatically reviewed within a short period, by which I do not mean 25 years.  I welcome the Minister's approach of reviewing these reliefs and questioning whether they are still warranted.  It is the appropriate approach to take.  My concern is that this change was not flagged to the industry.  Last night we discussed betting duty at length.  It was clearly flagged that there would be some change, given the tax strategy papers, as well as the Minister's comments that the industry needed to pay more.  However, this change has come on the sector suddenly.  The relief was meant to be temporary, but having been part of the tax code for 25 years, there was probably an expectation that it would not be changed.  I am not arguing that it should not be changed; rather, I am questioning whether sections of the industry have involved themselves in the practice of leasing fleets in the belief there would be tax relief.  They would have taken the decision on that basis.  Of course, we can change, introduce and abolish rates and reliefs at any time - I do not wish to take away from that - but there was a genuine expectation surrounding this relief and a genuine practice was employed as a result.  The change is sudden and the Minister has acknowledged that there will be an impact.  I am concerned that it will be felt more by smaller operators in rural areas.  Should it be implemented now or should there be a delay of one year to give the industry the clear signal that, although it will be part of the finance code, it will take effect from 1 January 2020, as opposed to 1 January 2019?  Perhaps there could be a commencement order or something of that nature.  Significant concerns have been raised.  While these reliefs need to be reviewed, re-evaluated and, where necessary, ended, it is also important that we not do anything that will cause a sudden shock that will not allow the sector to rearrange its operations in order that it can continue to provide services for the tourism industry, to which this sector primarily relates, and employment in many of the more rural parts of the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#E00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1505,"content":"<p>It is important to outline the position of the sector because, to the best of my knowledge, there was no consultation between it and the Department.  I am concerned about the impact on the tourism industry which has already seen an increase in the lower VAT rate.  This change will mean a difference of &euro;600 to &euro;700 per vehicle, a cost that will be passed on to the person who is renting a car.  The view in the sector is that this will impact on the supply of cars to the car rental fleet and car rental rates for tourists and may impact on the regional spread of tourism.  The refund scheme never represented a cost to the Exchequer; rather, it was a VAT equalisation policy in the pre and post-VRT eras to maintain parity, with the full cost of the vehicle being VAT deductible, rather than being seen as a tax expenditure.  It recognised the unique profile of short-term rental fleet movements and the industry's requirement to increase the size of the rental fleet rapidly for the peak tourism season and deplete it rapidly thereafter.<\/p> <p>  Is there an expected yield from this measure?  It was not flagged on budget day or in any of the budget day documentation.  Is it something the Minister is willing to re-examine?  He views the relief as a temporary measure, just one that still happens to be in place 25 years on.  I do not have an issue with the change, but it needs to be carefully thought through.

It is fair to acknowledge that this change was not subject to consultation.  However, we have so many examples of reliefs like this across the tax code that we have to recognise the right of the Government of the day to make changes.  If we are to be guided by consultation in every difficult change we make, the bias will always be towards not making the change.  I feel strongly that we have to be willing to consider how incrementally the tax base has become compressed owing to there being reasons for us to be unwilling to undo changes.  I have acknowledged that this change will have an effect.  As I said on another matter last night, there are few opportunities available to me to make or undo policy changes that do not cause difficulty somewhere.<\/p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Michael McGrath's point about cost, I can only provide a speculative yield at this point because the relief has been in place for a long time.  The figure is based on our judgment of the yield.  It is a big figure.  We estimate that the cost could be approximately &euro;20 million, although we have not included it in our budgetary arithmetic.  Were I to put that figure in front of the Oireachtas and given that it is 20 odd years since the relief was put in place, I would fairly be asked how we could be sure such a yield would accrue.  It is a significant figure.<\/p> <p>  We had a similar debate last night on the betting charge.  It was pointed out to me that, at the time of our greatest economic difficulty in 2008 and 2009, a change was proposed to the betting levy that subsequently was not implemented.  Were I to take that approach to the current proposal on the betting levy, it means that I would need to find &euro;50 million somewhere else.  That argument does not apply in this instance, as I did not include the &euro;20 million in my budgetary yield figures, but it is a figure the taxpayer has to find and one that has been embedded in the tax code for a quarter of a century.<\/p> <p>  Will the change have an effect on fleets and the choices companies need to make in terms of the availability and of vehicles and their types?  It probably will.  Such companies should, however, be able to respond to the change.  If Deputies wish between now and Report Stage to flag further difficulties or points of which I might not be aware, I will be happy to engage with the committee on them, but we should be willing to make this change.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#F00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1507,"content":"<p>Has there been an economic assessment of the change?  Clearly, many of the representations made raise concerns about its potentially negative impact on the tourism sector and certain commercial sectors which have an involvement in car leasing.  There has been a large amount of advertising of the notion of fly drive holidays in Ireland, particularly in the west in the context of the development of the Wild Atlantic Way and where the tourism industry is significant.  Prior to this arrangement being introduced by, I believe, former Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, there were periods when it was almost impossible to hire cars because of how the arrangements in place at the time worked.<\/p><p>Prices also soared.  This arrangement has stood the test of time, including periods when the tourism business advanced.

Has he had discussions with the sector about the flow of cars?  As the Minister knows, we are a little in the dark about how Brexit will roll out.  We are, therefore, in a transitory period for the economy.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to do have an economic assessment done and, if so, will he share the outcome with members?

The point I ask the Minister to consider over the next two weeks, before Report Stage, is that it is ultimately a further charge on the tourism sector.  The Minister has already decided to increase the lower VAT rate, which will generate between &euro;400 million and &euro;500 million in additional revenue from the broader hospitality and tourism sector.  This extra money will principally come from tourists.  The Minister says he believes companies will have the capacity to respond.  They will do so by increasing car rental rates and that should be acknowledged.  I understand that this measure was brought in when a new vehicle registration tax, VRT, regime was introduced 25 years ago to compensate leasing companies, rental car providers and driving school businesses for the change in how the excise duty was calculated on motor vehicles.  We are talking about the VAT applied to vehicle registration tax.  We will revisit the issue on Report Stage.  It is a further burden on the tourism sector at a time when a significant change has been made to the taxation code in that area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#G00200","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1510,"content":"<p>Deputy Burton asked if we had done an economic appraisal of this beyond knowing what would be the potential revenue gain.  We have not done such an appraisal because I decided we would be better off doing economic appraisals of the much larger decisions we had to make, for example, on the VAT rate applied to the tourism sector.  I do not ask my Department to do detailed economic appraisals of every decision we make because of the use of resources involved and, in this case, the scale of the decision involved.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we engaged with the sector about this decision before it was made, we did not do so.  As I informed the committee, this measure is part of a process I have undertaken where I asked my Department to examine reliefs that have been in place for a long time and tax changes made during the crash.  I asked it to provide me with a list of these reliefs and changes and an assessment of the pros and cons of changing them.  We looked at this measure as part of that process.<\/p> <p>  On the tourism impact, which is the point raised by Deputy McGrath, I would hazard a guess that the cost was not shared with him when people came to him seeking a change in this policy decision.  Approximately half of the cost of between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million relates to fleet cars and how fleets are leased, as opposed to tourism.<\/p><p>Half of it has to do with reliefs that we have in place for the leasing of fleets of cars to companies.  We have to ask if between &euro;10 million and &euro;20 million of the State's money is best used for doing something like that.  This was not a policy decision to stimulate the growth of the car rental and leasing sector.  It was a decision made in the early 1990s when we were going from excise to VRT.  Yes, there has been huge growth in the car rental sector since then, but I contend that the reason there has been huge growth and a huge decrease in the price of car rental across that period has been the massive growth in tourism and the rising incomes of people who have been visiting our country, as opposed to this change.<\/p><p> The view I am advocating to the committee and which I will advocate again on Report Stage is that while this may well have an effect on leasing arrangements that companies make and on the kinds of cars that are being offered to rent by car rental companies, and while it could have an effect on price, this is also a very competitive sector, so should it not be the case that we allow the private sector to work its way through those issues as opposed to maintaining a concession in our system that could have a price of up to &euro;20 million to it?  Over the next fortnight, before we go to Report Stage, I am happy to engage with members on the matter.  The cost of this could be as high as &euro;20 million.  That figure has perhaps not been present in some of the lobbying or advocacy relating to this change over recent weeks.  I note, in fairness to the committee, that nobody to date has advocated that this is a change that we should not make.  I think what colleagues are emphasising is that we should perhaps look at the timing of it or do an analysis of it.  My view is that this is a change that we should make, and we should make it in the way I have prescribed.  As I have said, if colleagues want to make me aware of any more significant issues beyond those of which I am aware, I am happy to engage with people on those.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#G00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1512,"content":"<p>Would the Minister agree to carry out an assessment and share it with us?  I am conscious from my experience of the tourism industry that it is very price sensitive.  We have a number of sensitivities that are particularly acute at the moment.  One is the likely impact of Brexit, the immediate significance of which, as the Minister knows, relates to currency fluctuations.  We are talking about the Wild Atlantic Way, which has been significantly successful in ensuring that, while there is a vast amount of tourism in Dublin, a very significant amount of tourism goes outside of Dublin, and it is to be hoped it is high-value tourism.  Many of our tourism plans are posited around that.  It is especially significant for counties from Donegal down to Kerry and beyond.  There have not been large numbers of jobs coming to these areas.  Along with the change in the VAT rate, which may well be and will have to be absorbed by much of the industry, we are talking potentially about two big changes.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the Minister that fleets are also an issue in this, but the primary and immediate knock-on effect is on the fly drive tourism business, into which Cork, Shannon and Knock airports and smaller airports such as in Kerry and Donegal are all tied.  I would like to see some level of assessment of how this would be phased in in a way that would not be negatively disruptive.<\/p><p>For instance, there is a big development in Longford, Center Parcs, which will not come on stream for some time.  However, given the way it is going about its marketing, it is obviously intended for people who will drive a car and, if it gets the custom it anticipates, it may include people who have hired cars.  In that case, people are not supposed to use a car after getting there but, of course, they have to get there in the first place.

With regard to what that means from a tourism point of view, let us say all of that &euro;600 or &euro;700 was to be passed on to the tourist.  Most car rental agreements for tourists tend to be over a number of days and they could be for a week or a bit longer.  If the company makes the choice to pass all of this on to a tourist, it means an additional cost of &euro;1.50 to &euro;2 per day.  The question I would put to the committee is whether it is good use of the State's resources to be unknowingly investing &euro;20 million per year in maintaining a discount like this.  My view is that the answer to that question is \"No\".  We should be willing, area by area, to find examples of things like this that we are willing to change.  Three, four or five changes like this in every budget is &euro;50 million to &euro;100 million extra of base broadening in a way that is sustainable for our country, and I think that is what we should be doing.<\/p> <p>  Am I willing to undertake a further economic appraisal of it beyond what we have done?  No, I am not.

I could say, for every single decision I make, that I will not make that decision because it is going to create the potential for cost somewhere.  That is the reason none of these things has changed for 20 years and it is the reason that, in bigger areas, one of which we will come onto later in the day, we have been willing to leave really big issues in place in our tax code for too long.  I believe we should adopt a different approach and this is one example of it.  As I said, if there are any further issues I have missed in this regard which committee members want to make me aware of, I am happy to engage on that.

This applies to a small number of microbreweries which are at the point of sustainability and where the extra allowance would add to their sustainability and viability.  We are talking about a very small number of microbreweries which are in an intermediate phase, so the cost to the Exchequer would not be in any way significant and, at a certain stage of development, it would allow these breweries to get an additional advantage.  There are a number of examples of companies that are currently at an intermediate stage and employ up to 100 people each, but they are at their limit.  In addition, there are four or five breweries employing 100 employees or more and, allowing for current trends, they will be at their limit within 12 months.<\/p><p>I believe the industry favours the incremental increase which has been set out in this amendment so that progress is sustainable and targeted to the domestic brewing industry.  This is an industry that has a vital connection to tourism all around Ireland.  The interesting thing about the microbreweries is that they have brought employment and economic development prospects to areas which have not had much foreign direct investment.  The same could be said, of course, about the distilleries, in particular the specialised brands of whiskey and gin being developed.  They have become very fashionable and have taken off with many younger drinkers, and they are a feature of an Irish holiday for many tourists. <\/p><p>I can understand that the Minister and his officials might be rather cautious about this but I am sure they have done the maths.

The current production ceiling is 40,000 hectolitres and the claim ceiling is 30,000 hectolitres.  By way of illustration, 40,000 hectolitres is equivalent to 7 million pints or 12 million 330 ml bottles, so it is a very significant amount of production.  In fact, where two or more microbreweries operate in conjunction, the scheme allows that they may produce up to 80,000 hectolitres, claiming excise relief on up to 60,000 hectolitres.  This enables small breweries to work together and produce larger amounts while still qualifying for the relief.<\/p> <p>  I am informed that increasing the production ceiling as proposed would benefit a very small number of local microbreweries in the near term.

An increase in the production ceiling to 60,000 hectolitres would likely further encourage non-Irish microbreweries to avail of the relief and potentially compete in the Irish market.<\/p><p>My Department has not been approached about this proposed change.  I understand the companies supporting it are at the largest end of production.  If we were to bring in this change, it would mean that microbreweries located elsewhere in the EU would benefit provided their products are sold in Ireland.  There is already a very significant relief in place, amounting to 27 cent per pint.<\/p><p> While I am willing to consider the proposal, I will not give a definite commitment to change it at this point.  That it has not been the subject of broad representations to me gives me food for thought.  Moreover, the benefit would be confined to the larger craft microbreweries and the measure would have a neutral effect elsewhere.  The benefit would also accrue to larger breweries located outside Ireland.  These factors make me wonder whether it is a change worth making.  I am not rejecting it out of hand now because I have great respect for what has happened in craft brewing in Ireland.  While I no longer classify myself as a young tourist, or even a particularly young citizen, the development of this industry is a credit to everyone involved in it.  Whether one is a tourist or a citizen, the industry has brought great enjoyment to those who have sampled the products brewed here.  It is an important area of innovation in Irish food and drink.  That is the spirit in which I view the development of the industry.<\/p><p> The facts that my Department was not approached on this matter in the run-up to the budget and that the measure is focused on large companies gives me pause.  I will consider this matter before Report Stage but I want to carefully examine who would benefit from it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#K00300","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1522,"content":"<p>There is a problem for businesses in Ireland.  Pearse Lyons, who sadly died this year, was doing great work in the microbrewing and microdistilling sector ten or 15 years ago when he came back to Ireland.  He got people to think about brewing and distilling.  Many developments have taken place since then.  It is particularly noticeable that areas which have not enjoyed the kind of foreign direct investment from which the large cities have benefitted are now experiencing a significant organic economic development.  Such development can deliver a substantial dividend in terms of jobs in areas that otherwise have been left behind.  I would be delighted to see more developments at local level similar to the Longford example I gave earlier.  It is interesting to note how the Scotch whisky industry developed on the Scottish islands 100 years ago, particularly in the context of the First World War.  That development left Ireland behind.  I am anxious to ensure we are proactive in assisting these kinds of developments.<\/p><p>They can add significantly to the economy.  Microbreweries and microdistilleries are fashionable at the moment.  I do not know if all of them will survive, but I certainly think that when they get to critical mass stage, for instance, when they have significant numbers of employees, particularly in isolated rural areas or smaller towns, they will potentially have an enormous role to play in generating the rural economy, allied with the generation of the food economy which has also been progressing.  Places such as west Cork come to mind immediately.  <\/p><p> I thank the Minister for his comments.  This conversation will continue.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister has indicated that he is open to further discussions with the committee and the industries.  It is important that we maximise their employment potential.  There have been very strong links between them and institutes of technology.  Modern scientific knowledge and qualifications have helped students studying in this area.  Employment opportunities have been created for people who 12 years ago would have moved abroad to gain experience.  Now there are opportunities at home.  The entrepreneurial interests of many younger people have also been stimulated in a very positive way.  I will withdraw the amendment and encourage people to take up the Minister's invitation to have a conversation about how the industries will grow.  We are talking about a tax advantage which, correctly, should be examined and reviewed, as opposed to a grants-based approach whereby very significant grants are given.  The summer festival season in Ireland now runs from Easter.  This time period is really important to rural Ireland in areas outside the big cities.  The opportunity for these businesses to have a presence at these events is enormous and adds to the potential for employment creation and economic development.  Farmers' produce is used in these industries.  It is an important and solid market for them if the industries can reach a certain scale, creating a demand that can be relied upon by those growing crops for them<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#L00200","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541671200,"counter":1524,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1525,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 149:<\/p><blockquote>In page 130, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Report on increasing floor of diesel rebate scheme<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>40. <\/b>The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report of increasing the floor at which the diesel rebate scheme becomes available for Hauliers.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This amendment concerns the diesel rebate scheme.  There is an error in my amendment, of which the Minister's officials have been advised.  It should read &quot;decreasing the floor&quot;, rather than &quot;increasing the floor&quot;.  It is a substantial error, but I know that the Minister is aware of the objective.  There was an expectation that there would be moves to bring diesel and petrol into line in the budget, but that did not happen.<\/p><p> There is also concern about the operation of the diesel rebate scheme, particularly in the context of Brexit and the resultant longer journeys.  There is still a lot of uncertainty.  Hopefully we will get a deal that will mitigate many of these concerns.  The industry has been arguing before Oireachtas committees in favour of amending this scheme.  Its spokespersons argue that the floor, which is currently set at &euro;1 before value added tax, VAT, should be reduced to 85 cent.  They also argue that the rebate rate should be increased from 7.5% to 15%.  I do not agree that the rate should be at that level, but there is merit in reducing the floor from &euro;1 to 85 cent.  Through the Department of Finance we costed this at &euro;5 million, which is a significant cost but not a huge one in the context of the budget.  The question is whether the industry needs support.  Moreover, is this an industry facing serious challenges, particularly in light of Brexit?  When we look at international comparisons, is the rebate scheme supportive of an industry comparable with other areas?  Is fuel tourism still taking place?  The answer to some of those questions is \"Yes\".  There are serious challenges and concerns.<\/p><p> The environment is another issue we have to weigh up.  We know we need to move people to more energy-efficient fuels.  Is that possible at this point for the haulage sector?  The information provided to me suggests that this is not the case.  Other types of fuel would increase the weight load and payload and therefore require hauliers to carry lighter loads in their trucks.  That would require them to make more journeys.  Instead of taking one trip from Donegal to Dublin, they would have to do two because they would not be able to carry as much bulk as a result of having to move to other fuels.  We have not come up with a real alternative at this point.  There have been very positive moves on Euro 6 engines, which are much cleaner than older engines.  <\/p><p> There is a genuine reason to consider this issue.  The Minister should be open to changing the floor because for some years now there has been no real benefit to the industry because of the price of diesel.  The benefit is now 1.8 cent or 1.9 cent per litre.  Due to the price of diesel previously, there was a negligible benefit and in some years there was no benefit whatever.  The best way of doing this would not be to increase the rate but to change the floor, which would allow more people to avail of the scheme at the same rates.  It would come at a cost to the Exchequer.  I put this forward as a Brexit mitigation proposal regardless of whether there is a hard or soft border.  In the best-case scenario there will be an impact on the haulage industry.  That is without question.  This is one way we can support it.  It is not a huge amount of money, but I am not minimising the amount involved either.  It would be a positive signal on this issue.<\/p><p> I would prefer if this were in the budget.  We argued for this in our alternative budget.  I am looking for an indication from the Minister that he will consider this issue in the context of Brexit and the challenges this industry will face.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#M00300","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1527,"content":"<p>The diesel rebate scheme was introduced by my predecessor in 2013 in recognition of the high price of fuel at that time and its adverse affect on the transport sector.  The scheme offers a partial excise refund for qualifying hauliers and bus operators based on the retail price of diesel.  The repayment amount is calculated based on the average price at which auto diesel is available for purchase during the repayment period.<\/p><p>Relief can be claimed when the retail price reaches &euro;1.23, including value added tax, VAT, up to a maximum rate of 7.5 cent when the price reaches &euro;1.54.  Despite recent increases in international fuel prices, with a cap of &euro;1.54, the scheme continues to compensate hauliers for such increases.  The current scheme offers sufficient protection against rising costs and the effect on competitiveness and, as such, I do not intend to conduct a review of it, with a view to amending the floor price.  I met representatives of the sector and it appears that there was an expectation that the scheme would change.  That expectation did not come from me or my Department.  I cannot be in a position where expectations are created and imposed on me and, when I do not make particular changes, I am expected to fix the issue.  I never gave an indication that the scheme was going to be changed.  In the engagement my Department has had with the sector we have always been very clear that the scheme is in place.  The drawdown is still considerably lower than we expected.<\/p><p> The Deputy asked whether there was still diesel tourism.  I expect there is.  However, the plan we have in place is a proportionate response to the challenges the sector is experiencing.  When I met representatives of the sector, I agreed to review the scheme in the context of the Finance Bill and the budget next year.  I am happy to have a look at where we stand and engage with the sector.  That is the appropriate way to look at the scheme.  As I said, the drawdown is lower than we expected.  The pricing and capping of the scheme are still within the realm of what I believe works for the industry.  There are many aspects at which we will have to look if things really begin to change next year and we experience many acute difficulties as a result of Brexit.  In meetings with sector representatives I have said we will review the scheme in the context of the budget next year, like any other scheme we have in place.

As I said, there are lot of things we may have to do, depending on the outcome of any Brexit deal.  As I have argued, unless there is a complete reversal of the decision taken by the British people two years ago, there is no possible deal that will not have an impact on the haulage sector.  In my wildest dreams I cannot envisage an outcome that will not have some impact.  The question is how significant it will be.<\/p> <p>  I do not want to rehearse the matter, but there is an issue about the drawdown.  First, for several years the scheme was of no benefit to hauliers.  For about two years after it was introduced there was a benefit.  Because the floor had been set at &euro;1 without VAT or &euro;1.23 with VAT, there was no cost to the Exchequer for two years as the price of diesel was below that figure.  The scheme has only started to be of benefit in recent times.  The benefit is currently in the region of 1.8 cent per litre, but I am subject to correction.  Even with that figure, hauliers who travel internationally fill up abroad.  I talk to hauliers and know people involved in the industry, including family members, and they tell me that that is what is happening.  The rebate schemes available in other jurisdictions are much more generous than for what we are arguing.<\/p><p>I am not arguing for that.  The industry wants two things.  It wants the floor decreased to 85 cent and the rate increased to 15 cent, which would cost &euro;22 million.  I am suggesting we do just one of those - reducing the floor - and it would amount to less than a quarter of the amount requested by the industry.  It is the best way to capture more people.  It gives a small bit of benefit which I hope would offset some of that fuel tourism in the first place.<\/p><p> There is the matter, which I will mention again, of equalisation between diesel and petrol.  I agree with the Minister about expectations and I have never heard an expectation created about this.  The only expectation I understood relating to this would be that it would exist to offset an equalisation measure.  What is the Minister's opinion on equalisation of diesel and petrol?

A change through this scheme was put in place in recognition of the challenges faced by the sector.  I am being careful currently as many different needs are being advanced to me under the heading of \"Brexit\" or precautionary measures to be taken in advance of Brexit.  I am being careful about what we do as all of this has consequences elsewhere.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty as no scenario is likely beyond the British people making the decision to reverse Brexit that gets us to a place in which trade and contact with the UK would be identical to what it is today.  That is because of the simple reason that the UK will become a third country.  It is the choice it has made.  We will work very hard to mitigate the effects of this and we hope we can get through the current phase - which we will - so we can play our part in seeing that agreement is reached between the European Union and the UK, respecting the importance of trade between both.  There will be change and this will have consequences for different parts of our economic sectors.  We will have a look at this scheme in advance of next year's Finance Bill and we will engage with the sector as part of that.<\/p> <p>  In responding to Deputy Pearse Doherty, it is fair to say that I am informed the price of diesel went as high as &euro;1.50 in the early years of the scheme, although in subsequent years it has dipped.  That has affected the drawing down.  As we can see, changes in the price of diesel now should affect use of incentives available to the sector and I expect to see more drawing down through the scheme than we have seen recently.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about equalisation and I decided not to do it in this year's budget for many reasons.  For one, I am conscious of the tremendous importance of diesel in how we fund access in and out of our country.

We need to formulate innovative ways to support the sector in this respect.  Even the Department's report indicated that this was not being passed on.

If we had separated the two of them and made a move on hotels but not on other sectors, we would be breaking a link that has always been there.  The Deputy may feel differently about it, and he clearly does, but I go back to a thread I have had in many of the different changes that we have argued.  If a change is made that benefits many different sectors and we say that change is going to be temporary, if the change goes in one way, affecting all, then the logic I am now establishing is that it has to go in the other way, affecting all as well.

It is because all of these arguments are continually put with regard to different parts of our tax code that we have not been willing to make changes to reliefs at a time when changes should have been made.  It is for that reason that the appropriate way to do this is to undo this change in the way that it was made in the first place.

It is not the case that if he does not do it now, he will never do it.  He can take these steps now, as we have done in respect of other legislation with which I do not agree.  For example, mortgage interest relief is being stepped down every year for a number of years.  When we dealt with mortgage interest relief for landlords, it was being increased by 5% every year.  That was put into our legislation.  We did this in a number of other areas as well.<\/p> <p>  It could be done like that if the Minister so desired, given he has clearly acknowledged that the sudden impact of a 4.5% increase in VAT may not be as easily absorbed in the sectors in question as in others.  The Minister should legislate for the increase in a stepped way, which allows the sectors a bit of breathing space in that, while they would take a hit because the rate would increase next year, it would allow them time to factor in that it will increase to the full 13.5%.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#S00300","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1556,"content":"<p>If I had put in varied treatment by sector, for example, if I had said we will do hotels in one go but restaurants on a phased basis, two things would happen.

I know Ministers for Finance are very reluctant to talk about VAT on children's footwear and clothes but, in essence, what I am seeking is an update, if there is one, as to whether or not the Revenue Commissioners have had any engagement with trade associations in this regard.  In summary, the position is that we cannot change the relevant age of the child at which zero-rating ceases to apply, which is currently 11.  The question, however, is what the relative sizes are.  According to the Revenue and the Department, &quot;The practical application of the measure is that zero rating applies to children's clothing of sizes up to and including a 32 in. chest, a 26 in. waist or 152 cm in height; and children's footwear up to and including a size 5.5 or 38.&quot;<\/p><p>We had a good discussion on this last year, primarily with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I asked that Revenue would engage with the trade associations again and undertake some consultation on whether the sizes that are deemed by Revenue to be appropriate for children under the age of 11 are still applicable or should be reviewed.  That was the thrust of the conversation last year and hopefully there will be an update.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#U00800","speaker":"1223","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1568,"content":"<p>As the Deputy stated, this issue was discussed in the debate on last year's Finance Bill and relates to the application of the VAT zero rating that applies to children's clothing and footwear.  Under Article 110 of the VAT directive, member states may retain the zero rates on goods and services that were in place on and from 1 January 1991 but cannot extend the zero rate to new goods and services after that date.  As the Deputy is aware, the zero rate of VAT applies to clothing and shoes for children and this is possible under EU VAT law because the zero rate applied to these goods on and from 1 January 1991.  It is not possible under EU VAT law to extend the application of the zero rate by raising the age limit of children to whom the zero rate could apply in respect of articles of clothing and footwear.<\/p> <p>  Since the mid-1980s, Irish VAT law has defined children&rsquo;s clothing and footwear as that not exceeding the size appropriate to children of average build and foot size of ten years of age.  This includes clothing described, labelled, marked or marketed as being for children under 11 years of age.  The practical application of the measure to date is that zero rating applies to children&rsquo;s clothing of sizes up to and including 32 in. chest, 26 in. waist or 152 cm height and children&rsquo;s footwear up to and including size 5&frac12; or 38.  These sizes were determined in 1984 after consultation with clothing and footwear trade interests at both manufacturing and distribution levels and, at that time, were considered to be generous.  A further review of the average size of footwear for children was carried out in 1997 but there was insufficient evidence at that time that would warrant a change in the 5&frac12; limit.<\/p> <p>  Following last year&rsquo;s debate, the Revenue Commissioners recently completed a review of the average shoe and clothing sizes for ten year olds.  This review produced no evidence to support a change in the existing guidelines.  Revenue approached a number of experts including in the ESRI as well as academics in the field of nutrition and children&rsquo;s health.  These experts told Revenue there was no data that would enable them to complete the study that Revenue was seeking.  Revenue then reviewed information publicly available from a number of businesses, including the largest retailers in Ireland, on clothing sizes for ten year old children.  All of these measurements, with one exception, indicated that the current clothing sizes for chest and waist were below the current published Revenue guidelines.<\/p> <p>  I would add that Revenue has not received any submissions or contacts from Deputies, businesses or representative bodies in this regard following the discussions last year.  As matters stand, I have no basis on which to alter the guidelines but I remain prepared to do so if data becomes available that would support a change.  I reiterate that Revenue would welcome submissions from interested parties in this regard.  I hope the work we have done to date on this demonstrates to Deputy Michael McGrath that we have taken the matter seriously.  We have no evidence to support the change and for that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#V00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1569,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for his reply.

The one exception referred to measurements rather than a retailer, so the vast majority, with one exception, of the work we did indicated that the measurements available in the tax code correspond with children's sizing.  I imagine there must have been just one outlier in this regard.  I ask the Deputy to bear with me for a moment while I consult my officials. There was one brand whose sports trousers appeared to be out of kilter for certain sizes with what we have in our tax law.

When a child is not of average size, for example, he or she is aged ten years, going on 11, and requires size 6 footwear, whether trainers, football boots or whatever else, VAT is paid at the full rate even though the child is under the age at which such products should cease to be zero-rated.  On the basis that the child is not of average measurements, the 23% rate applies.  The issue here is that the retailers, in pricing these products, have completely separate price ranges.  Taking the example of footwear, there is one price range up to size 5.5 and an entirely different price range above that.  The problem is that the difference is not just in the VAT rate.  Rather, adult footwear is marketed as a completely separate stream of product and at an entirely different price from children's footwear.  What might be &euro;40 for a size 5 or 5.5 could be &euro;70 or &euro;80 for a size 6, 7, 8 or 9.  This is the reality that parents and families face when it comes to this issue.  This is why it needs to be examined.  I think what the Minister is essentially saying is that we are in a straitjacket because of EU VAT law, that the age cannot change because it is the age that was set when the directive came into being and that the only flexibility we have is in respect of what the average sizes are for children in that age bracket.  It would appear, therefore, that we have very limited flexibility.

The larger driver of this, as he just said, tends to be the price at which the manufacturer seeks to retail the product rather than what is happening with the taxation on it.

The only flexibility we have is in respect of sizing.<\/p><p>The Deputy is correct about us basing this on average sizing, which is the only way we can make such a decision.

However, there is a Revenue concession that allows the zero rate to be applied to certain types of food supplements, such as vitamins, minerals and fish oils.  The practice of zero rating vitamins, minerals and fish oil food supplements has been applied since the introduction of VAT on 1 November 1972 when the marketplace for food supplements was small.  However, this concession is proving to be problematic.<\/p> <p>  Elements of the food supplement industry have made a sustained challenge to the application of the standard rate of VAT to certain food supplements.  There are concerns that, while elements of the industry apply the correct rates, others have a competitive advantage by applying the zero rate to products that are properly liable at the 23% rate.  The crux of the argument is generally that the products concerned are similar and compete with other products that are zero rated.  Protracted correspondence on the issues has raised concerns regarding possible non-compliance in the sector, in particular the zero rating of products that should be standard rated, which may result in a degree of unfair competition between compliant and non-compliant businesses.<\/p> <p>  Revenue's position is that food supplements are not food and, as such, are not entitled under VAT law to the zero rate of VAT.

This is relevant, especially given that we have a housing crisis and a housing shortage and, according to the IFAC heat map, there is no risk to overheating in the housing construction sector.  Deputy Pearse Doherty is looking for a report within six months of passing the Finance Bill on the impact of increasing non-residential stamp duty by 1% and how that would or could dampen down the non-residential sector.<\/p><p>Not only that, I imagine both the Minister and I would agree that capacity and labour shortages in housebuilding are relevant.  Even if we put all the money in the world into housebuilding tomorrow, only so many houses can be built given the labour available.  Would this not be a way of redirecting some of the labour from the non-housing construction sector, which is going ahead too hotly, into housing construction?  I am seeking some brief comments from the Minister on that point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#Z00600","speaker":"1280","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1596,"content":"<p>Broadly, the risk identified by the Deputy is the reason I increased stamp duty on commercial property last year from 2% to 6%.  I believed there was a risk of overheating in the sector.  In particular, I believed that we were facing an issue because, from the point of view of the Government, we had a preference for economic resources and human capital to be deployed in supplying homes but instead it was being absorbed into the delivery of commercial property.  We reviewed the position on rates for commercial property.  We went from 9% to 6% to 2%.  I decided, in the context of the evident risk, that it was appropriate to return the rate to 6%, which is where it used to be.  This has meant that we have delivered a significant increase in the yield on stamp duty on commercial property.  We are behind target compared with the figures we had.  My expectation is that we will catch up on that target in the remaining months of the year.  However, at this point it is likely that we will miss it.  The question of by how much will become evident as we move into the end of the year.  The way the tax operates means that it tends to be influenced by a small number of high-value transactions.  As we move through the year we believe it is likely that the figures will increase beyond where we are, but maybe not come in exactly as we forecasted.<\/p> <p>  Given that I made such a significant change last year I decided it would not be the appropriate stance to take to change it again this year, especially given where we were with yield.  It is a sector in which we have already made a large change in recognition of the risk that Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and IFAC have identified.  Given the tripling of the rate last year I decided that a further change this year would not be appropriate.  Is this something that we will keep under review?

It is an issue raised with me by a tax practitioner and it relates to the application of agricultural relief in the context of Brexit.  Under the definition of &quot;agricultural property&quot;, it relates to agricultural land and pasture woodland situated in a member state.  The question that has arisen is in the context of Brexit.  When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union, what will be the status of land in Northern Ireland in the context of agricultural relief in this jurisdiction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#BB01800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1616,"content":"<p>I want to first set out the current position on capital acquisitions tax, CAT, agricultural relief.  The purpose of agricultural relief is to encourage the productive use of agricultural land and to prevent the sale or break-up of farms to pay a CAT liability.<\/p> <p>  Agricultural relief operates by allowing the value of agricultural assets received to be reduced by 90% of its value for the calculation of the CAT liability.  This is a key relief in ensuring the inter-generational transfer of farm assets and plays an important role in farm succession planning.  To qualify for the relief, certain conditions must be met.  The first condition is that, following the inheritance or gift, at least 80% of the property owned by the farmer consists of agricultural property.  A second condition, known as the active farmer test, is in place to ensure that the farmland will continue to be actively farmed following the inheritance or gift.<\/p><p>Agricultural land owned by the farmer and located either inside or outside the State can be used to determine qualification for this relief.  Equally, the agricultural land which is inherited or gifted to the farmer, on which CAT is relieved, can be inside or outside the State in any part of the European Union.<\/p><p> I want to reassure the Deputy that the possible impact of Brexit on this specific relief is something of which I and my officials are fully aware.<\/p><p> An agricultural relief for CAT has been in place since CAT was first introduced and I am conscious of the importance of this relief to the farming community.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that Brexit negotiations are still ongoing and there is a very wide array of issues that we will have to deal with, particularly in our tax code.  At this point, it would be inappropriate and premature for me to comment on the future of this relief until a clearer picture emerges from the Brexit negotiations.<\/p><p> I hope the Deputies will appreciate that there is sensitivity regarding elements of our tax code that prevent me from giving a further commitment on that point now.  However, I want to emphasise the importance of seeing a successful outcome from the negotiations centring on Brexit.  I reiterate that given the implications of this particular relief, it is something of which I am very much aware.  It depends on the outcome of Brexit negotiations that will take some time to complete.  <\/p><p> Before I comment any further on this relief, there is a broader set of principles on which we will need to get agreement.  I reiterate for Deputy McGrath's information that I am aware of the importance of this particular relief.  The safest thing to do would be to allow us continue with work that we have on the outcome of Brexit.  Much of the work that will need to take place on this is still some way down the road.  We have a set of other issues that we are trying to get resolved.  The wisest thing for us to do will be to look at this relief at a later point in the context of a set of other decisions rather than me committing to a report on it now that will only restate what I have just said to the Deputy.  For that reason, I would ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing this amendment in light of the fact that I recognise the importance of this issue, but there are many other issues we need to get resolved first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#BB01900","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1618,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.  I understand the predicament the Minister is in, namely, that this is one of a great many issues in the mix in the Brexit negotiations.

If the UK is gone from the EU by the end of March 2019, it will no longer be a member state.  Is it not the case that a change in our legislation will be required?  Given that that timeline is only a number of months away, we could have a situation where a small number of individual cases could arise in the first half of next year.  That is the reality.

The most significant one is the Apple investigation.  <\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, Article 12 deals with the artificial avoidance of permanent established status.  This means that a proposed new test in Article 12 looks at how much presence a company must have in a country before it has to pay corporation tax.  It provides that an enterprise of one country is deemed to have a permanent establishment in another country if it operates through a dependent agent in that other country.  I am not saying that we will not sign up to it.  I have met Christian Aid on this and I can see the role it could play in the future either on a bilateral level or through the OECD.  However, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding how it would be implemented and a lot of jurisdictions with which we have significant trade have not yet implemented it.  I will keep it under review.  I am not ruling out the possibility of it forming a part of our tax code in the future but until I see how it is implemented and until I see a number of other countries participate in it, I think it would be too early for Ireland to move to implement it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#FF00800","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1647,"content":"<p>On amendment No.157, I acknowledge that this time last year, I raised the issue of the Minister and his officials meeting Christian Aid.

A number of countries are moving to adopt this tax.  Most surprisingly, in his most recent budget, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer moved to a digital tax proposal of around 2% to 3% - presumably with rebates relating to tax paid in the UK.  I am sure the Minister and possibly his officials were a bit surprised by this proposal by the UK Chancellor.  I think this move by the UK is indicative of where the digital tax proposals stand.<\/p><p>It is genuinely difficult for many countries, and it will be even more difficult in the future, to be able to secure additional tax flows and revenues from the very big IT and social media multinationals that are immensely rich and generate vast revenues, that all of us use in our daily lives, and about which there is no global agreed approach as to how they should contribute their fair share of taxation in the different countries in which they sell their products.  It is a real problem for national exchequers to have vast economic activity that contributes no taxation.  In many ways, Ireland was an early starter in the development of employment and industry in this sector.  As a consequence, we have significant numbers of people employed in the sector and very valuable economic activity on which tax is paid in this country.  As we move increasingly to automation and robots in the sector, however, we all have to look at how we generate tax flows for national revenues from this vast area of economic activity.<\/p><p> This proposal is very simple.  It is to ask the Minister to report to us within a short period after the introduction of the Act to indicate how a digital tax might operate, the likely tax rate and whether the tax paid can be offset against tax liabilities.  I have chosen these three points because of the French proposals.  By the way, the French made the Minister a very good offer not too long ago and asked for his co-operation on it.<\/p><p> A similar situation is occurring in Italy and it is also happening in Austria.  The Germans are actively examining this, and the Spanish, and possibly the Portuguese, have indicated that they are following in the same vein.  In terms of our future in the European Union, particularly post Brexit, it behoves us to be as informed as possible about this form of taxation that is coming down the line.  While we can decide to stick our heads in the sand and pretend it will not happen, it is already under way.  This simply asks the Minister to publish a report that would be made available to the committee and the public in general on how this tax might operate.  It may end up being in effect a form of sales tax with abatement for taxes paid in the country.  I am sure the Minister's officials have attended discussions on this.  I do not know whether it will be abated by other taxes paid by the entities in particular countries, for instance, employment taxes, possibly other contributions such as PRSI and employment and social insurance levies and corporation tax that may or may not have been paid.<\/p><p> I noticed that the British Chancellor, in his statement about this commencing, I understand in 2020 as a fact, pencilled in a couple of billion pounds on an annual basis to the British Exchequer.  It is time we had a serious examination of this.  The amendment is very simple.  It just asks for the Minister's co-operation in having a review of where these proposals are at so that we can all examine them and see how the D&aacute;il might like to proceed in this respect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#GG00700","speaker":"1253","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1654,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is similar to that of Deputy Burton.

There may be some discussion about what type of digital tax would be applied and how it would be fair and would not overly disadvantage a country such as Ireland, but the general principle that these people should be taxed to a far greater degree than they are is, to me, a no-brainer.  It has to happen, it will happen and it is right that it should happen.  We need at the very least to start to have a detailed debate about it.

When the issue first developed the Department, as it is required to do, sent a comprehensive set of scrutiny notes to the Oireachtas.  Subsequent to this, officials from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the committee to outline how the digital sales tax would operate.  We have already submitted a report to the committee on this issue.  We have already done what the amendment is asking me to do.<\/p> <p>  Committee members may be aware the Houses of the Oireachtas, following us submitting the information the amendment is looking for, issued reasoned opinions on the draft directives that they breach the principle of subsidiarity.  In terms of providing information and reports, officials from the Department and the Revenue Commissioners have come before the committee.  We supplied all of the information asked for and subsequently we supplied that information in written format.  We have done what the amendment asks us to do.  If there is further information that committee members want me to supply I am very happy to do so because this is a very important area.<\/p> <p>  Before we get into a debate on the substantive issue itself, I want to correct the record in several important areas.  The only French offer I received is that issued in public to me on Tuesday morning when the Minister, Mr. Le Maire, invited me to go for a beer with him.  That is the only offer I have received.  I want to be very clear about this because there has been a lot of speculation about it and I want the committee to be assured of this.  Deputy Burton said this measure would raise many billions of euro.  She used the word \"billions\" in respect of the UK.  The amount of revenue the UK Government has put against this for 2020 is &pound;400 million.  That is not billions.  To put this in context, for us &pound;400 million is roughly equivalent, for the sake of argument, to the value in euro of between &pound;30 million and &pound;40 million.  It is very important that we are clear on the scale of revenue the UK Government is looking to raise through this measure.<\/p><p> I also acknowledge that the taxing landscape for digital companies is going to change.  I expect that will happen.  The question is the safest way in which that will happen.  From my point of view and from our point of view as an open, small economy, when we have seen major change like this happen in the past, it has been through the OECD.  This has happened in terms of the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process for other major corporate tax changes that have taken place.<\/p><p> It is my strong view that if a digital tax were to happen, with Europe making changes in isolation without a global consensus on the issue, there would be the potential for trade consequences from this, and there would be the potential for international tax co-operation in this area to be affected.  If either of those two scenarios were to happen, this would pose very significant challenges for Ireland.<\/p><p> I believe change will happen and, as part of that, there could be various consequences for Ireland.  The safest way in which this can happen is the way it has happened in the past, which is through the OECD.  The committee may be aware that the OECD has indicated that it will be publishing a report on this area sooner than it had originally indicated.  Intense work is already going on in this area as we speak.  Deputy Burton will be aware, if she looks at all of the issues that were navigated via the OECD in the past, that this offers the best vehicle within which we look to see change happen in this area.  I believe change will happen, and the safest way through which that change can happen is through the OECD.<\/p><p> I note that in the debate on the matter last Tuesday, and I have been involved in this for more a year, we saw a number of other countries express opposition to the current Commission proposal for the reasons I outlined.  Significantly, we saw countries that were in favour of this proposal being implemented begin to outline a whole array of technical issues that they wanted to be resolved.  For those of us who have been involved in this before, those technical issues are considerable and would have significant consequences for us.<\/p><p> To reiterate, this is going to be a new area of change.  As Deputy Burton was talking about the area of artificial intelligence, I was reminded of what the founder of Microsoft said recently that robots should be taxed.  These are the kinds of debates that are going to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#JJ00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1658,"content":"<p>I am trying to remember the report to which the Minister referred.

If the Minister were to implement something along those lines, given that there could be a case where tax is deductible, he could actually see a net loss from the introduction of a digital tax in Ireland.

Would it be levied on the service users in a particular country or on the intellectual property that is onshored?

It is useful that he has opened a conversation about digital tax.  There is a need for a fresh report because since the previous report was issued there has been an enormous change in the landscape and in attitudes.  The Minister is correct that certain countries have identified difficulties.  Sweden, for example, has expressed concern about its gaming industry.  That is true and I completely accept that point.  However, it would be really helpful to this committee to get an updated report.  As the Minister has said, departmental officials have all of the data and have been involved in all of the discussions and the conferences.  I see no reason the information they have collected and of which they are aware, which has not been the subject of much commentary in the Irish media, would not be shared with us by way of a report, given the significant implications for this country.  The approach proposed here is completely reasonable.  Shying away from dealing with this will not do Ireland's case any favours.  Obviously all of us here would seek to maximise the possibility of a fair and just taxation position for Ireland.  Other European countries have historic advantages that we do not enjoy in the context of taxation issues.  What we are seeking is tax fairness and justice in this area.<\/p> <p>  Why is the Minister refusing what is a completely reasonable and standard request for a report on an area of taxation that is changing?  I am glad that the Minister gave the example of the UK because in his report, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Hammond, indicated that within a number of years he would be expecting a net digital tax take of between &pound;1.5 billion and &pound;2 billion.  As the Minister said, this is not an enormous sum, given the size of the British economy and I agree that in the context of the Irish economy, the sum involved could be a lot less.  On the other hand, however, countries like Italy have been telling IT companies that unless they have a presence in Italy, then Italy will pursue Ireland with regard to earlier cases.  Officials here today know the cases what I am referring to.  I have asked many questions of the Minister and of Revenue with regard to back cases that are being pursued and the back payments that Ireland has made.

As Deputy O'Brien said, this has already been the subject of debate in the Oireachtas.  My officials were in front of the committee and this is the report that we produced before the summer.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Burton said at the start of her statement that I gave an extensive answer to the questions she raised and at the end she said that I had given a bland response, looking to brush away issues.  I hope the first part of her statement is correct and not the second part.  I am not shying away from anything.  I have been involved in this issue for over a year, trying to deal with the different issues that are at stake.  These are not discussions but negotiations on two different things.  The first is a matter that Deputy Burton called out well, which is the design and implementation of a tax like this.  As the Deputy acknowledged, the yield involved in such a tax is in many cases much lower than people might expect for a number of reasons.  In the UK example that the Deputy used, where billions of pounds were talked about being raised, it was across a five-year period.  Per year, it is a measure worth &pound;400 million sterling.  It is entirely possible that if this tax was implemented in the way currently proposed, it could represent a loss in some jurisdictions such as ours.  For other jurisdictions, the compliance involved in implementing it and some of the things that would need to be done would mean that the revenue brought in would be lower than expected.  Once the compliance costs were baked into it, the return that the exchequer in other countries would get would be much lower than people expected.  The journey that the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, George Osborne, went on with what he referred to as the \"Google tax\" was an example of this.  The yield was much lower than had been anticipated.<\/p> <p>  I have been substantively involved in this matter over the last year.  In one area, the figures and yields involved in it from our point of view and that of other countries would be much lower than people might expect.  The area of greatest concern for me is the many principles involved in this.  If the principles are reapplied for open service exporting economies, they could be very significant.  The principle of a group of countries or the European Union as a whole going down this path while we do not have agreement with other trading partners regarding how it should be implemented is a concern.  If that happens, those other trading partners could make decisions on trade and tax co-operation that would have very serious consequences for the European Union and could be difficult for Ireland.  For those reasons, I acknowledge that I expect to see change in this area but think Ireland needs to be clear regarding the best route in which we believe that should happen.  It is notable that across the last number of weeks, we have seen a number of other economies which are small, open and service-oriented say the same thing as Ireland has said.  I will not agree to a report because I would ask Deputies to be aware that I am involved in negotiations on this, not discussions, and if this committee wants information or clarification on any negotiations under way, I will supply it promptly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#MM00100","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1666,"content":"<p>Is Deputy Burton pressing the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#MM00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1667,"content":"<p>Yes.

I am sure the Minister is familiar with the concern raised in the amendment about section 110 tax relief which I see as a national scandal in that foreign companies essentially came here to speculate on Irish property having been invited by the Minister's predecessor in 2013.<\/p><p>A total of 65 meetings were held by the Minister and officials with Cerberus, Apollo Global Management, Lone Star, Kennedy Wilson, all those guys who came as bottom feeders to cash in in a distressed property market and who were actively courted by the previous Government to do so.  They availed of a tax break, which means that if they maintain their investment for a few years, they will not pay tax on rental income or capital gains, which is quite extraordinary.  If people really understood what was going on, they would be shocked.  What happens is that, apparently, small items in Finance Bills pass a lot of people by because they do not understand what is going on.  For that reason, it is important to shine a light on the issue.  When one considers by how much rents have increased since those guys bought into the Irish property market and by how much property prices have increased, the value of their investments has gone through the roof.  That is the other side of the coin in dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis that such entities are making obscene profits and will walk away without paying almost any tax.  That is something about which they boast when they produce their annual accounts.  Every year they record bigger profits than in the previous year and pay negligible amounts of tax which, to my mind, is shameful.<\/p><p> It is equally shameful that when the Minister is asked parliamentary questions by me and others about how much tax is forgone through this tax relief, we cannot get answers, which is beyond extraordinary.  We need a detailed report.  We need to know how much tax revenue is being forgone to the benefit of the property speculators who have come into the country to profiteer on the back of the housing crisis.  Over and above what is in the amendment, even at this stage, given what has happened in the property market and the extraordinary profits being made by the people concerned, any Government interested in fair taxation and generating revenues to perhaps be put into areas such as public housing would be looking at how we could increase the tax paid by such entities and put the revenue into public housing and other areas to address the housing crisis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#WW00600","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1677,"content":"<p>Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out a regime for the taxation of special purpose vehicles set up to securitise assets.  Securitisation is useful, both for banks in freeing up capital to allow them to continue to lend to all taxpayers and for the productive economy, as it can underpin the supply of capital marketing finance to industry and companies in Ireland, Europe and further afield.  We are not unique in having a specific regime for securitisations.  The importance of securitisation has been recognised, for example, by the European Commission through its work on capital markets union, a main objective of which is to build a sustainable securitisation regime across the European Union.<\/p> <p>  Section 110 companies can only hold certain qualifying assets.  Real property is not an asset a qualifying company can hold.  However, it can hold loans and other financial assets that derive their value therefrom.  Following concerns raised by the Revenue Commissioners and subsequently Deputies at this committee about the use of section 110 companies to hold debt secured on Irish property, the Finance Act 2016 made changes to the taxation of section 110 companies to ensure the profits which derived from Irish land and buildings were subject to tax in Ireland.<\/p><p>These changes took effect from 6 September 2016.  With regard to the specifics of the report proposed by the Deputies, I am advised that Revenue does not and could not collect the type of information that would be required to calculate the tax that would have been paid had section 110 not existed.  That is for two reasons.  In the first instance some of the business carried on through section 110 companies simply would not be carried on here or would have been carried on differently.  There is no method to take account of how behaviour would have changed had the regime not been existed.  Second, in the case of activity that would have taken place in Ireland, absent section 110, the hypothetical alternative tax would depend on exactly what the underlying business was and how it might otherwise have been funded - as a company, a partnership or investment fund, for example.  Any of those estimates would be highly subjective and could not be presented as an accurate assessment of the tax impact of section 110.  I therefore cannot accept the Deputy's amendment but I can accept that Revenue continues to keep the activities of the section 110 companies under review.  Where Revenue identifies misuse of the regime it will continue to bring them to the attention of my Department and I will act to close any gaps identified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#XX00200","speaker":"1292","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1679,"content":"<p>I tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill last year which is similar to that of Deputy Boyd Barrett's seeking a report on the operation of section 110 companies.

At the conclusion of the discussion on Report Stage the Minister acknowledged that Revenue would continue to assess the situation, as he just reiterated, but he said that he wanted further analysis and that when he received it he would answer questions on it.  Did the Minister receive further analysis in writing from the Department and could he share that analysis with the committee?

They were effectively invited in by the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Department in the meetings which were held.  I think there was an understanding that if they came here and bought into Irish property that they would pay very little tax.  The logic at the time, which was fairly explicitly expressed by the then Minister, was that we needed to reflate the Irish property market.  I think he argued at the time that it would professionalise the rental sector because we would have corporate entities as opposed to the small-scale landlord.  We were going to bring in the big guys.  It has self-evidently been a disaster.  It has not done anything to make the rental sector better.  It has done a hell of a lot to make it worse.  The Minister said in his response that if we did not have this relief certain activities might not have happened.  Yes, exactly.  I am sorry those activities did happen.  It is a matter of extreme regret that we brought such entities in here to gain such an important foothold in the Irish property sector.<\/p><p>It is obscene that those who benefited from the window that was opened in terms of section 110, even if it was closed subsequently, will continue to benefit from it and will walk away paying little or no tax on their investments.  I do not understand why Revenue cannot estimate how much tax is foregone.  When one looks at what has happened to the property market, the value of the investments that these persons made has gone through the roof.  The Irish property market, including the rental market, is generating staggering profits.  We know from the announcements of annual profits that they are going up and the companies in question are paying pitiful amounts of tax.  It is a scandal.  I do not see how it could be justified at any level.<\/p><p> There was something the Minister did not answer in his response.  If we were to debate what was done in the past, why it was done and whether it was good or bad, it would be self-evident given where all of this has led that the Government made a bad and disastrous mistake.  One does not have to be a tax expert or a financial whizz-kid to conclude that those who invested in property are making a fortune because it is obvious.  When one considers the 60% or 70% increase in the value of those investments and similar increases in rents, one would expect the Government to think of some way, perhaps through a levy or tax, of clawing back some of the money these companies have made on the back of a dysfunctional property sector.  This could be used to deal with the costs of the housing crisis that their activities helped to generate.  Given the housing crisis and the direction in which the property sector has gone in recent years, would that not be a fair and reasonable course of action?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#YY00400","speaker":"1238","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1683,"content":"<p>I am alive to the fact that the price changes we have seen in the property market could have a number of different causes.

To respond to Deputy Pearse Doherty's question, what I did in the aftermath of last year's Finance Act was ask for an appraisal to be done on the effects of the operation of these companies in the economy.  That work is being done.  By the end of quarter 1 of next year, the tax returns for these companies will have been filed.

The issues are well ventilated.  Rents have increased by 22% since 2016.  Rents have increased by 7.8% in the past 12 months in Dublin, despite the rent pressure zones of 4%.  The average rents in the State are &euro;1,060 and in Dublin, they are &euro;1,527.  Student rents are out of control and there is major pressure on these individuals in terms of having money at the end of the week to meet their needs.<\/p><p>The Minister will be aware rent relief was introduced in the State a number of decades ago by a previous Minister for Finance.  The interesting proposal at the time - neither of us were around - focused on pressures on the elderly in meeting rent payments.  It was designed with different tiers, but particularly with higher thresholds for the elderly.  I merely make the point that rent relief was a factor of the taxation code up until the crisis in 2011 when the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, as Minister, removed it through the Finance Act.<\/p><p>This would have an immediate impact.  For example, for somebody who is paying the average rent across the State of &euro;1,060, the benefit would be &euro;1,060.  Those living in areas with lower rent pressures would receive relief of one month's rent.  My party argues that this should be brought in over a three-year period.<\/p><p>Obviously, a rent relief such as this without a rent freeze would be foolish because all that would happen is the rent relief would be sucked up in an increase in rent.  This would have to go hand in glove with a rent freeze which, I believe, is required.  Yesterday, the Minister answered a question from one of our colleagues on whether rents are too high.  They are too high but the law allows them to continue to go higher.  What we need is for them to go in the other direction.  The least we should do is ensure that they are frozen.  Alongside those two measures, we would need to see an increase in planned capacity from State investment.<\/p><p>I believe this measure is warranted.  It would cost &euro;250 million over a three-year period.<\/p><p>Let me mention the discussion on intangible assets that we had last night.  We dealt with that and it is disposed of.  The Minister is not amenable to accepting that amendment and implementing the policy of Mr. Seamus Coffey but if he was, even the revenue that would be generated in one year from that proposal could fund this for the next three years at which point it should be phased out.<\/p><p>I have made my point.

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief had an effect on the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.  In addition, a tax credit of this kind would be of little benefit to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax.  Finally, at the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97 million per annum.

This relates to a report.  I am sure the Minister is aware of our full proposal, which is that rent relief would be introduced and there would be a rent freeze or cap at the same time.  The argument that this would go directly into the pocket of landlords would not hold as rents could not increase over those three years.  The Minister is correct about what would happen if this was non-refundable, which is not the case.  The proposal we have is that this would be a refundable tax credit, meaning those on low incomes that do not have a tax liability would still be able to avail of it.  This is particularly pertinent to students, as the Minister mentioned.<\/p> <p>  The cost would be significantly increased from the previous scheme based on the Residential Tenancies Board number of tenancies and average rent, leaving the figure just short of &euro;250 million.  This is an emergency and this is a time for emergency action.  This rent relief could not sit on its own without a rent freeze.  Even with those two elements, it would make no sense unless we ramped up serious capacity within the sector.  That is why we in Sinn F&eacute;in argue that an additional &euro;1 billion should be invested in social and affordable housing.  If that does not happen, after the three years the assistance would be turned off but we would still have the same problem if supply did not increase in the sector.  This is a response to the Minister's comments, while acknowledging that the form in which we must submit amendments cannot deal with a rent freeze or the tax-refundable nature of the proposal.  The report would establish that.  We are not really seeking a report but rather for the Government to take serious action to help the 240,000 renters out there who are finding it difficult to make ends meet.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#BBB00200","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541671200,"counter":1689,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1690,"content":"<p>The Minister must leave now so we will suspend our work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#BBB00400","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1691,"content":"<p>May I make a brief statement?

We can look at international experience and the thresholds applied and see that is very clearly the case.  The threshold of &euro;50 million is high.

In Portugal it is &euro;25 million and in Australia it is the equivalent of &euro;18.5 million.  This amendment seeks to deal with a matter in which we seem to be out of kilter.

Perhaps it is something we will deal with on another day, particularly allocated resources to each division.  There may be a bit of an issue with regard to alignment.

There is no common definition across different jurisdictions on assessment - it is up to each jurisdiction to determine a threshold - but our threshold, in the words of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is high compared with others.

Many managing companies that are residence owners are facing financial difficulty partly as a result of landlords not paying these fees.  Landlords are collecting rent and not paying the management fees.  Those not paying the management fees should not be able to claim the relief.

In 2017, Revenue compliance activity included a focus on the rental sector.  As set out in its annual report, there were 5,332 interventions in that sector in 2017, with a total yield of &euro;44.8 million.

This allegation - I stress that it is an allegation - is included in the discussion document being considered by the PAC.  We had the chiefs of RT&Eacute; before the PAC earlier this year.  It has been claimed as late as last night that the use of personal service companies by top earners is entirely legitimate.  It is also common practice across the industry, which I do not dispute one bit.  I am not suggesting there is anything untoward here.  What we are talking about is whether the law should be changed in the future.<\/p><p>I have raised this on a number of occasions with the Minister, in particular as to whether his attention had been drawn to the work of the British tax authorities, who found against persons who worked for the BBC organisation and used contracting companies to avoid tax, and whether the Revenue Commissioners were investigating how this operates here.  It is provided for in Irish law.  The question is whether it is appropriate or fair, as I believe it is not.  A commitment was given to me at time, as follows:<\/p><blockquote>I am advised by Revenue that we have no comparable legislation in Ireland governing the taxation of individuals engaged through intermediary companies.  As a consequence, there is no basis for Revenue to seek to ignore contractual arrangements entered into by such a company and to apply the tax treatment that gave rise to the appeal.<br \/><br \/>In relation to the question of an investigation or audit, I am further advised by Revenue that it cannot comment on matters relating to any specific identified taxpayer or narrowly defined group of taxpayers.  However, in the absence of legislation similar to that referred to above, there is no statutory basis for Revenue to take the approach that gave rise to the recent UK appeal.<\/blockquote> <p>The question is whether there should be a statutory approach and whether we should put something into the law that allows for this.  These types of contracting companies are similar or identical to the types operating in Britain, which has closed them down.  I argue through this amendment that we should look at this in a detailed way, given there could be unintended consequences.

He will also be aware that this report was informed by a public consultation.<\/p> <p>  The report noted that the development of personal service companies and managed service companies created a triangular employment relationship where the services of a worker are secured through a third entity, thereby distancing the employer from direct engagement with the worker under either a contract of service or a contract for services.  This created complexities in establishing the rights and responsibilities of each of the parties with regard to tax, social insurance and employment rights.  I might add that such arrangements are not peculiar to the entertainment sector.<\/p> <p>  Some have argued that the avoidance of tax and social insurance obligations is the primary motivation for the use of personal service companies and managed service companies, and that workers are increasingly being directed by employers to supply their labour through these types of intermediaries.  Disguising employment in this manner also enables employers to avoid some employment law obligations and can undermine the employment rights of the workers concerned.<\/p> <p>  The report found that the majority of the loss to the Exchequer in these circumstances was in the form of PRSI revenue rather than tax and, as Minister for Finance, I share the Deputy&rsquo;s concern that such structures could be put in place for these purposes.<\/p><p>However, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners are working closely with their colleagues, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and other agencies, to deal with this issue.

As there is no statutory provision to prevent this practice, the Revenue Commissioners have no mechanism to appeal it.  The only way this can be ended is if we allow for what is a legitimate practice like this to become an illegitimate practice in the future.  <\/p><p>The <i>Irish Independent<\/i>reported on the discussion document of the Committee of Public Accounts, which includes a chapter on RT&Eacute; and draft conclusions and recommendations.

The practice is legitimate and people will obviously use legitimate means to reduce their tax liability if they have the wherewithal to do so.

The relief has expired for mortgages taken out prior to 2004 and ceased for new borrowings from January 2013.  This mortgage interest relief is, therefore, only available on qualifying mortgage loans taken out between 2004 and 2012 and is being phased out for the remaining recipients on a tapered basis to alleviate the potential financial difficulties of the cliff that may arise if the relief was removed in a single year.<\/p> <p>  The rate in 2018 is 75% of the rates that applied in 2017, namely,  15%, 20%, 22.5%, 25% and 30%, with the application of these rates depending on an individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  The rate of relief will be reduced to 50% of the 2017 relief in 2019, and 25% of the 2017 relief in 2020, as legislated for in last year&rsquo;s Finance Act.  In 2018, the estimated cost of mortgage interest relief is &euro;124 million, reducing to &euro;78 million in 2019.  If the 2018 rates and qualifying interest levels continued to apply from 2019, as the Deputy has suggested, the cost would be an additional &euro;46 million per annum.<\/p> <p>  There were 292,448 mortgage holders in receipt of this relief in 2015, including those who purchased at the peak of the property market and also those who bought during the subsequent trough.  There is, therefore, an equity issue around any further retention of the relief in the current form beyond 2021 as not all mortgage holders can avail of the relief.  The decision to abolish mortgage interest relief was prompted by the view that relief effectively becomes priced in to the purchase price of the property.  Research by the ESRI contends that demand side oriented tax incentives that target home buyers are likely to result in increased house prices, with a limited increase in supply and, thus, the home purchaser is unlikely to be a net beneficiary.<\/p><p>For these reasons, I am not in a position to commit further resources to continuing the relief beyond the current end date, let alone extend it in the way the Deputy has suggested.

We have seen a slight drop in the number of claims for this credit in the past year.  We can see from the latest data available that &euro;523 million of the amount of &euro;670 million claimed went to very large companies in 2016.  We have evidence from the reply given under a freedom of information request that there is concern that the scheme is being used to reduce tax liabilities through the inflation of expenditure on research and development.  The figures tell us that 78% of the cost of the credit was accounted for by large companies or companies in the large cases division.  Huge companies are soaking up the the cost of the credit and, potentially, there is concern that some of them are inflating their expenditure on research and development.  On the other hand, we have SMEs that do not bother availing of the credit, do not know about it or think it is not worth the hassle because of their experience or the risk in applying for same.  Therefore, we need to seriously consider providing this tax credit.  A substantial report on research and development was carried out two years.  Unfortunately, quite a number of its recommendations were never implemented.  They considered how we could make sure the spend on research and development was curtailed.  The report made some interesting proposals in that regard.  <\/p><p>Research and development are vital and play an important part in business and the economy.  They allow companies to be at the cutting edge.  Therefore, we need to promote research and development and encourage far more companies to become involved.  The problem is that only 22% of the cost of the tax relief is accounted for by small and medium-sized enterprises.  As many as 300 companies - the larger companies - account for 78% of the cost, while fewer than 1,200 account for the the remaining 22%.  I genuinely believe we must consider how SMEs are treated north of the Border.  I am not saying the situation there is perfect or that we should mirror the scheme in place, but there are people who work on both sides of the Border and make applications on behalf of businesses.  They can verify the differences for SMEs in the North and the South in terms of the challenges faced in the South.  As recommended by the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC; the Irish SME Association, ISME, and others, there would be merit in considering the SME light research and development tax credit available in the North in terms of the protection provided and all of the anti-avoidance issues that arise.  We must consider introducing a separate rate in the South.  We have argued, for example, that the 25% rate should be reduced to 20% for non-SMEs but increased to 30% for small and medium-sized enterprises to encourage research and development.<\/p><p>Let us consider where we are in the economy and business and strip out multinationals which I acknowledge create employment and provide a tax base.  I will not go into all of the issues concerning some of them but will park them to one side, although I know that the Minister does not have the luxury of doing so.  The SME sector is not as profitable or productive as it should be.  There is a serious issue because the level of foreign direct investment mirrors something.  If it was stripped away and we just compared the SME sector with others, we could see we have an issue.  One of the ways by which we could invigorate the sector is by providing support for research and development.  That is why I think there would be merit in considering ways to encourage more businesses to avail of the research and development tax credit and thus participate in research and development.<\/p><p>There are two deterrents, the first of which is the bureaucracy involved.  The application process for the tax relief has been christened by the likes of IBEC as &quot;SME R&amp;amp;D light&quot;, which is what the tax relief has been called in other jurisdictions.  The second deterrent is the current rate.  Obviously, in increasing it to 30% a cost would be incurred by the Exchequer, which is why I suggest the rate for larger multinationals be reduced to 20%, which would still be generous.  Let us recall that &euro;523 million of the total cost of &euro;670 million was claimed by about 300 companies.  Unfortunately, I do not have figures in front of me.  The rest - about &euro;150 million - was claimed by 1,200 SMEs.  I suggest we use tax policy to encourage placing the focus on SMEs.  Perhaps there are better ways and solutions, but I offer my suggestion as a way to improve things as we cannot just kick on.  The cost of this tax credit is huge; &euro;500 million goes to multinationals.  I am not saying they do not engage in research and development because obviously they are, as the report has shown.  However, there are concerns within the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, or at least among certain people in the two organisations, that the spend on research and development has been inflated.  We need to encourage the sector - SMEs- that needs the biggest helping hand at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#EEEE00600","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>I agree with the point made by the Deputy about productivity levels in the SME sector.  Earlier in the year my Department published a paper, in conjunction with the OECD, in which we analysed productivity levels in the economy once we had stripped out the very large companies integrated into global supply chains.  The analysis showed that we had productivity levels that were lower than they should be for smaller companies.  The initiative announced by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the future work programme which will gradually replace the Action Plan for Jobs looks at the quality of work and productivity levels within all areas of the economy.  It is fair to acknowledge productivity levels as an issue.  In addition, when we talk about multinationals broadly and the changes that have happened within the country, one issue on which I think we do not place enough emphasis is the number of Irish companies that, with great success, diversified into overseas markets and managed to scale up very quickly when the domestic economy was going through a great difficulty.  I point to companies as Glanbia and Cement Roadstone Holdings as excellent examples.<\/p><p>On the specific amendment the Deputy has put to me, I will cut to the chase.

A tax on vacant property based on the value would encourage owners to put it to good productive use.  We can see that in the midst of a housing crisis in Vancouver, properties deemed empty are now subject to a tax of 1% of the value of the property of the 2018 assessed taxable value.  Most homes are not subject to the tax as it does not apply to principal residences or homes for at least six months of the year.  All home owners, however, are required to submit a declaration.<\/p><p> On the vacant residential land tax, almost 200 sites and properties, worth millions of euros, were identified as lying empty in Dublin city and county as per data from the authorities.  These vacant sites are worth more than &euro;400 million and have been identified in 114 locations across Dublin city and county, the vast majority of which, almost 90, are in the Dublin city area alone.  This has been recorded by the vacant sites register.<\/p><p> From 1 January a residential land tax was applied to homes in inner city Melbourne that were vacant for more than six months in the preceding calendar year.  A vacant residential land tax can be assessed by calendar year, from the start of January to the end of December.  The six months do not need to be continuous.<\/p><p> There is a need for such a measure in the light of where we are at this time with a significant housing crisis and all of the factors that lead to that.  Within the cost of construction, land value is one of the major issues which we need to deal with in a very robust way.  The measures which are outlined in my amendment No. 171 are to combat the issue of land hoarding.  There is an incentive for individuals to hoard land because the increase in the value of land makes it profitable for them to sit on land that should be released for development.  There is a genuine need for some type of taxation proposals that would encourage if not force these land hoarders to release this property onto the market, whereby there would be a negative economic impact on them if they were to continue to carry on the practice of hoarding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#EEEE01400","speaker":"1288","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1752,"content":"<p>As regards a vacant property tax, an independent report on this topic commissioned by my Department was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 18 September 2018, in accordance with the provisions of section 86 of the Finance Act of last year.  The independent Indecon consultants report on the taxation of vacant residential property presents a detailed evidence-based assessment of vacancy rates in areas in which the demand for housing is most acute.  This assessment suggested that the vacancy rates in these areas is significantly lower than the national average and indeed has fallen in recent years.  The report also suggests that the vacancy rate is likely to continue to fall.  The report did not recommend the introduction of a residential vacant property tax at this time as it did not indicate that it would be an effective response to deal with housing shortages.  The report's view is that low vacancy rates in the areas of greatest demand for housing, particularly in terms of medium-term vacancy, indicate that the potential for a vacant property tax to increase housing supply is limited and could indeed represent a distraction from the need to accelerate significantly the building of new social and affordable housing, and the facilitation of other housing supply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#FFFF00200","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1753,"content":"<p>I disagree with the Minister that the report as proposed in this amendment does not need to take place and that more ambitious measures do not need to be taken.

There is an incentive here where we allow for fund structures, in a very tax-efficient way, to buy up property.  We can see from all of the data published by the CSO that cash buyers, of which these fund structures make up the significant part, are competing in a very aggressive way with families, newly-weds and individuals who are trying to acquire their first house, especially here in Dublin city.  Figures show that close to 50% of sales are cash purchases at certain times.  There is almost &euro;17 billion of IREF assets in the State.  That is the quantum that we are told in the tax strategy papers.  We know that the average yield in rent in the State is 7.5%.  How did they pay only &euro;9 million in tax on more than &euro;1 billion of income?  I have discussed this with the Minister before.  The accounts of these funds are available.  One can see the actual tax that is being paid because of the tax efficient ways in which they do not have to pay it.  It is appalling.  The tax rate of some of these funds is 1.8%.  This is the kind of structure that we have put in place.<\/p><p>I can remember when some of these structures came in.  It was a time when there was a very dampened property market.  That is not where we are at this time.  I recall the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, saying that we needed to get a floor and to get people in etc.  Things have moved on.  There needs to be an assessment done on the impact that these structures are having on property prices because they are able to push up prices because they have the availability of funds to set market prices.<\/p><p>There is an issue as to the supply of residential properties because these funds are able to compete with individuals.  It is ridiculous.  Some of these funds are landlords.  Some of these tax-efficient funds are charging outrageous rents which are among the highest in our capital and they then pay 1.8% in tax on their income.  There has been some work done in this area but it is time to go back and look at it all again because they are clearly not paying a reasonable amount of tax.  These amendments are sensible.  They are asking the Minister to look at these structures and to look at how they are impacting on property prices, at the supply of residential properties in the State, at the structures themselves, and at how they are allowing for a very small effective rate of tax to be paid on income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#FFFF00800","speaker":"1288"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1759,"content":"<p>The Deputy may be aware that during my response to amendment No. 161, tabled by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I advised that my officials would undertake to report next year on the activities of such structures in the Irish property market.

He has programmed in a 33% reduction in DIRT by 2020, but the exit tax remains at 41%.  Within a couple of years the difference in rates will be 8%.  As the Minister knows, the exit tax applies to certain investment and savings products, generally long-term investment products.  His answer last year was along the lines that it came down to the fiscal implications of moving the exit tax rate in line with DIRT.  There is a significant difference already and it is going to grow to 8% by 2020.  I am seeking to establish what the policy is at this point.

While I am aware of the policy value in doing this, in the context of other choices I had to make I was not in a position to do it this year.  I also considered removing the 1% life assurance premium.  However, the cost of removing it entirely was &euro;18 million, while reducing it to 0.5% would cost &euro;9 million.

Very often the products subject to the exit rate of tax offer higher returns.  They are generally longer-term products.  As we know, deposit rates in retail banks are close to zero at the moment.

However, the party who originally earned the pension is obliged to include that pension amount for the purposes of calculating their standard fund threshold even though they would no longer be the beneficiary of that pension and the person who is benefiting from the pension adjustment order does not have the value of that pension count towards their standard fund threshold.  It only counts once but it is fully counted in respect of the person who, for example, paid into that pension and accumulated that pension pot and as a result of the breakdown of the relationship, the settlement that has been agreed and this pension adjustment order being made, their standard fund threshold is effectively reduced.<\/p><p>It is a quirky one but it can have serious implications for those caught up in it.

I advise the Deputy that Revenue has published a considerable amount of information and detailed guidance about the standard fund threshold regime.  Therefore, there is no requirement for an additional report as has been suggested and the policy position on the matter is well settled.<\/p> <p>  The State offers extremely broad pension relief to encourage individuals to save to ensure they will have sufficient income for use in their retirement.  The standard fund threshold operates to cap the amount of tax relief for pension savings that are utilised by high earners.  In this way it targets excessive pension accrual and the overfunding of supplementary pension provisions on values over &euro;2 million.  <\/p> <p>  For example, in the event that a married couple gets divorced, there may be a court ordered legal division of their assets.  In the case of a pension, there could be a pension adjustment order that sets out the terms of how the pension benefits are to be apportioned between the now divorced individuals.  When applying the standard fund threshold to determine whether a chargeable excess exists on the pension fund, in accordance with section 7870 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, the pension fund is treated as a single asset and the pension adjustment order is to be ignored for the purposes of determining whether the standard fund threshold has been exceeded.  The order is, however, taken into account when determining the portion of any chargeable excess that is payable by each spouse.<\/p> <p>  To give the full picture of the types of relief beyond the standard fund threshold, I also note that where married couples divorce or separate and civil partners separate, each former spouse or civil partner may be entitled to a separate and distinct tax free lump sum of up to &euro;200,000 in respect of a lump sum which is the subject of a pension adjustment order, something that may not necessarily be available to a married couple or civil partners.  The specific disregard of the pension adjustment order is a justified anti avoidance measure that is designed to prevent an individual whose pension is subject to such an order from availing of further tax relief at significant additional cost to the Exchequer.  It has never been the case that a divorce or separation would lead to each former spouse or civil partner getting a standard fund threshold in cases where there was previously only one.<\/p> <p>  This would lead to a significant cost that would benefit a very small number of individuals who, in the eyes of many, would be seen as being wealthy.  The funding for and accrual of pension benefits for the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements are unaffected by the standard fund threshold scheme.  Given that we need to concentrate our resources to deal with many of the issues that will arise from the road map of pension reform, that is where we should put the resources of the State as opposed to dealing with this matter.<\/p> <p>  For that reason I do not accept the proposed amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#JJJJ00900","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1807,"content":"<p>The Minister is effectively saying that the standard fund threshold is not divisible and so it cannot be separated - to use that unfortunate word.<\/p> <p>  Let us take the example where a pension adjustment order dictates that a pension of &euro;20,000 per year has to go to an ex-spouse.

The proposed amendment is technical in nature and is intended to clarify that pension payments to be made to former civil servants under that Act are to be made by the Minister for Finance rather than the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p> <p>  I fully recognise that farm income volatility is a prevalent feature of the agricultural sector.  In response, targeted relief to assist with income volatility is available to farmers under the income averaging scheme.  The scheme provides a useful mechanism for smoothing out income volatility associated with the farming sector by allowing farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period.  Initially, farm averaging was only available over three years.  Then, in the Finance Act 2014, the time was extended to five years to assist in ameliorating volatility.  In acknowledgement of the prevalence of income volatility my Department has sought to enhance and introduce further additional flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets to recognise the reality of income volatility in the farming sector and to maximise the number of farmers who wish to level out volatile income through the averaging system.  Different measures have been put in place.  In the Finance Act 2014, the Finance Act 2016 and in this Bill I have made further changes relating to income averaging.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department conducted an agri-taxation review update.  The review analysed the progress made in implementing the 25 recommendations in the 2014 agri-taxation review.<\/p> <p>  As there is already a targeted tool available to farmers in the form of income averaging, I decided not to go down the farm deposit route.  As already mentioned, I have sought to further enhance the existing targeted income volatility support this year by opening up income averaging to all farmers.  On the basis that a targeted scheme is in place, I consider that I have already conducted a review of agricultural taxes.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.  However, I will keep this matter under review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#KKKK00300","speaker":"1292"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541671200,"counter":1814,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 185:<\/p><blockquote>In page 142, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Tax and fiscal treatment of landlords<\/b><br \/><br \/><b>60.<\/b>The Minister shall within 3 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the implementation or non-implementation of the proposals outlined in the Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Rental Accommodation Providers and reasons for the non-implementation of any proposals outlined in that report.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>This relates to the report of the working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation providers, which was published on budget day last year.  The Minister has made some moves on the options set out.  I realise these were not recommendations but they were options and they were costed.  It is important and timely, given the housing crisis, for the Minister to clarify the intention with regard to the remaining options that have not been implemented.<\/p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party welcomes the acceleration of mortgage interest deductibility for landlords.  During our discussions with the Fine Gael Party in advance of the budget, we discussed other options, in particular, encouraging longer-term tenancies.  This is a real structural issue in the Irish rental market.  Tenancies are too short-term in nature.  We need to get to a point where people have far longer security of tenure.  This could include rental agreements for ten, 15 or 20 year periods.  We need to recognise and accommodate this in our taxation system.<\/p><p>The other issue we discussed was the possibility of incentivising the purchase of a property with a tenant <i>in situ<\/i>.  In the current market, where an owner is selling a property with a tenant, the tenant is often served with notice because the prospective purchaser wants vacant possession, even if the prospective purchaser intends to let out the property again.  There is also an issue with regard to incentivising the purchase of properties where transactions are going to happen anyway.  In certain cases it may be beneficial to incentivise a purchase where a tenant remains <i>in situ<\/i>so that the tenant avoids the disruption of having to leave a property because the home is being sold, perhaps even to another investor.  Not all these options were in the initial report but I believe they should be considered.

I attended the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection today and someone was there from the Department, speaking about this issue.  What she said indicated that the Government has its head in the sand on the issue of bogus self-employment.  The main line the Department had was that there was an issue but it was not as much of an issue as was anecdotally indicated, and that the Department does not keep records of bogus self-employment.  It does thousands of inspections a year but does not keep records at the end of the process.  It is not a serious approach to this issue.<\/p><p>Approximately 12% of workers in this State are self-employed without employees.  It does not mean they are all bogus self-employed but it certainly opens up the possibility that some of them, potentially quite a number, are.  The evidence from trade unions and other sources indicates that there are areas of the labour market where there is extensive bogus self-employment, in construction, delivery, courier companies etc.<\/p><p>Some of that is not really the business of the Minister's Department but it relates to his Department and Revenue with regard to the question of the loss of income to the State.  There is a substantial saving for employers who use bogus self-employment, in the region of 30%, as a result of not paying PRSI etc.  That saving for them is a loss to the State.  Different figures have been produced about how much there is.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has a figure based on the construction industry of &euro;80 million a year or &euro;600 million since this became very widespread in the construction industry.  I have heard bigger figures than that but in any case there seems to be a significant issue here.  The State is losing out on at least some money, arguably quite a substantial amount, and it also has a negative impact on the quality and decency of employment because people who are working in these conditions end up having worse terms and conditions and fewer rights.  That is the idea behind a report on the scale of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPS2018110800002#LLLL00600","speaker":"1433"},{"type":"speech","time":1541671200,"counter":1829,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

The report provides that information on an individual level.  Aggregating that information to a total level is where the difficulty is.<\/p> <p>  If the Department was aware of this as an issue through its compliance efforts, it would intervene, thereby reducing the loss to the Exchequer.  The view of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is that this issue is not occurring on the scale that I think the Deputy believes it is.  The report goes on to try to estimate the number of people who may be involved in intermediary arrangements.<\/p><p>The report reads:<\/p><blockquote>Estimates by Revenue suggest that the number of people employed under PSC and MSC arrangements is of the order of 15,000, with average annual receipts per contractor of &euro;60,000.

I also made the point that I opposed the situation in bygone times where information on abortion was legally withheld from women.<\/p><p>I thought it should never have been the case.  Everyone should have full information when making a decision, and that information should be medically accurate.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  It seeks to ensure there is informed consent.  I have had experience of people who have had abortions and who have said to me that there was information they wished they had at the time which would have helped them in making those decisions, which is not to say they would have made different decisions, but it would have improved their ability to make the decisions.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  The amendment takes into consideration the fact that, because there is an element within the Bill that allows for emergency abortions and other provisions that allow for elective abortions, such consent and information can obviously be impossible to deliver in cases of emergency, such as a risk to life or a serious risk to health.<\/p><p> I am not a big fan of the term \"cooling-off period\", but it is interesting that the Minister mentioned it yesterday and said it was a disgusting term to use.  \"Cooling-off period\" are actually the words the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, used in the campaign, and I do not think Deputy Coveney is disgusting when he-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#C00900","speaker":"1235","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1861,"content":"<p>That is not what I said.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#D00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1862,"content":"<p>It is not, but the Minister did say the words the Simon used were disgusting.

I have great difficulty with this amendment for quite a few reasons.  The first and the broad reason relates to our good discussion yesterday, which was of considerable length, about the issues of consent and of clinicians fulfilling their duties under the Medical Council guidelines.  I struggle to believe that Doctor, or rather Deputy, T&oacute;ib&iacute;n - a Freudian slip - would believe that a doctor would not, before carrying out any procedure, discuss it with the woman, seek her consent and make her aware of her options.  In the proposed subsection (2) of his amendment there is the idea that a doctor must give medically accurate information to a woman and describe the treatment and the medical risks.  This is what happens today in our health service.  We do not feel the need to codify this for any other procedure because this is what doctors do.  There is a long-established principle of informed consent whereby doctors set out the facts for Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n or me or a woman when we go to a doctor.  The doctor then ensures that the woman is aware of any relevant information and has consented.  We had quite a lengthy discussion about this, and I read to the committee from the Medical Council guidelines yesterday regarding the principle of consent.  That is the first issue I would raise.<\/p><p>The second issue is that the amendment seeks to change the principle of consent because it specifically seeks to change the age of consent to 18, whereas the medical age of consent in this country is 16.  This is another change, and it is quite a significant one, but it was not mentioned in the Deputy's introduction to the amendment.  It is a substantive amendment in this regard.<\/p><p>One of the lines in the amendment that greatly worries me is the proposed subsection (2)(b)(ii), which states:<\/p><blockquote>(b) a suitably qualified person has informed the woman, orally and in person, of:...<br \/><br \/>(ii) the fact that the father of the foetus is legally liable to assist in the support of the child, even in instances where he has offered to pay for the termination of pregnancy.<\/blockquote> <p>I am genuinely a little confused about this because the statistics collected by the UK Department of Health show that the majority of Irish women who access termination in Britain are in relationships, that is, they are married or have partners.  This provision seems to suggest or imply something, and while I am not going to use some of the language I think is behind it, it seems to imply that it is only a certain type of woman who seeks a termination.  The reference to the father being liable to support the child's upbringing is quite peculiar.  It is also important to note that in certain crisis pregnancy circumstances in which a woman seeks a termination there will be victims of rape and incest and issues of sexual assault.  The amendment runs the risk of being quite traumatising in this regard.<\/p><p>I do not wish to be flippant about a serious matter, but the idea that the health service is going to start producing DVDs, handing them out to women before they access terminations and saying, &quot;Go home there now and stick that on and have a look at it,&quot; is really offensive but also entirely unnecessary.  Women are intelligent human beings who will have researched the issue, consulted their doctors and made informed decisions.  The legislation is already quite prescriptive, and in the eyes of some people too prescriptive, in how this deliberative process will be followed.  The idea that a DVD would have to be made available to women seeking terminations is wholly unnecessary, to put it mildly.<\/p><p>Similarly, as for the issue of a website being available, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will know, the HSE already runs a number of websites concerning sexual health and well-being.  There is also Positive Options and the like.  Since, thankfully, it will soon be legal in Ireland to make this information available because we repealed the eighth amendment, information about the options - all of them - available to women will now be made available.  Legally, we could not make this information available previously.  I appreciate the fact that the Deputy said he did not agree with that position.  We will now make that information available.<\/p><p>The Deputy referred to counsellors.  I do not think this amendment relates substantively to the issue of counselling but, to be clear about the Government and the Oireachtas fulfilling its commitment, counselling is already available through the HSE's crisis pregnancy agency at locations throughout the country.  Doctors and doctors' practices already know, as I am sure Deputy Dr. Harty will be aware, through their engagement with the HSE, how to access crisis pregnancy counselling.  We will significantly further increase this provision and invest in it.  We are providing a 24-7 helpline that will be operated by healthcare professionals - nurses, doctors and counsellors.  We will also regulate counsellors and psychotherapists so they are real counsellors and psychotherapists and not people pushing agendas that are anti-woman, anti-choice and anti-best medical evidence.  I hope everyone in this House will support me in this regard.<\/p><p>To return to this amendment, and as I said yesterday on other amendments, the issue of consent is addressed in section 22.  I know that Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I have different views on this, which in fairness the Deputy acknowledges, and he outlined his view yesterday.  Termination of pregnancy should be a part of the public health service like other health services.  Therefore, I do not see any reason to differentiate the issue of consent in this legislation relative to any other procedure provided as part of the public health service.  The Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners of the Medical Council 2016, a document I have used and on which I have relied quite a lot in recent days, provides thorough information on the appropriate process to be followed to obtain valid, informed consent for medical procedures.  The HSE has also published a national consent policy which includes detailed information as to what constitutes valid and genuine consent and how to obtain it.  We had a very good conversation yesterday about the issues of consent, parental notification, what one should do in difficult and horrific situations in which something very troubling, for example, a woman having been abused or a child - a girl - having been sexually assaulted and the like, is brought to the attention of a doctor.  Our Chairman, with the benefit of being a doctor, outlined to us the obligations a doctor would have in such a situation, which entirely tallies with what the Medical Council guidelines state.<\/p><p>I am aware that there is sometimes a case to be made for special provision to be made in respect of consent to a termination of pregnancy in the case of an adolescent.  This is the case the Deputy has been making in recent days.<\/p><p>I am of the view that issues around consent arise across medical practice and are not limited to this particular issue.  As I said yesterday, one could argue that many of these issues also arise in contraception, gender realignment and cosmetic surgery, but we have not changed the laws or codified it in any other way.  The issue of consent is dealt with adequately and comprehensively in section 22.  Some of these things, intentionally or otherwise, would be viewed as extraordinarily offensive by women who have accessed termination.  The idea that women would have to watch a DVD or that someone would need to tell them about the legal requirements for the father of that foetus or baby and explain to them what is going on in their own body, health and well-being nearly seems condescending.  It is back to trusting doctors and trusting women and I am satisfied to do both and that the legislation deals adequately with the issue of consent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#D00600","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1867,"content":"<p>I do not support this amendment.

I think I have the floor.  Part 4 says that consent to a termination of pregnancy is voluntary and informed only and if alternatives to the termination of pregnancy have been advised.  There is only one alternative to the termination of a pregnancy and that is the continuation of a pregnancy.  I do not know why that is there.  I had a read through it.  I note that most of those proposing it will never be in that situation.  I am not sure what the intention of this is other than to say to the thousands of woman who have had to have a termination that they did not know what they were doing.  It seems a judgmental amendment.  I do not mean this in a disrespectful way, but there is something very patronising about deciding that an adult woman who is about to undergo a medical procedure does not know what she is doing and is not able to get the facts.  Anyone who has had a termination, or has accompanied a friend or relative to England to access a termination, will know that all of the information that a person requires and needs to know can be accessed.  Indeed, the desire to be informed as a woman undergoing a medical or surgical procedure is there, and the information is there.  I find it very disrespectful that somebody thinks it needs to be put into law that a woman would be obliged to find out the sort of information that, if she needs it, she will find anyway.<\/p> <p>  I stand over the comments I made.  This is misogynistic in its intent and there are elements of it that are laughable.  The idea of a DVD is a bit outdated.  Of course there are not alternatives to the termination of pregnancy.  There is only one.  A woman either terminates the pregnancy or continues with it.  There are a lot of factual inaccuracies in this.  I will not support it.  I will vote against it because the intention of it is clear, regardless of whether the proposers want to admit that here in this room.

What is being proposed is forcing any woman who is about to have an abortion to watch a DVD, get a description of the operation and of \"the probable anatomical and physiological features of the foetus at the time the termination of the pregnancy is to be performed\".  I do not intend to keep coming into this debate, as I said yesterday, but I would like the proposers of this amendment to consider how cruel they sound to the public.  We have all described to them situations of somebody having an abortion because of a fatal foetal abnormality.  The proposers of this amendment want those women to sit and listen to a description of the features of the foetus.  \"The Handmaid's Tale\" is on the television at the moment.  We are only a breath away from it with the likes of this and references to foetal pain.<\/p> <p>  I do not know if it is normal for a man who is going in for a cancer operation to be sat down and shown a DVD of the operation, or have it described in detail by doctors.  I do not think that is the case.  I am pretty sure it is not.  It seems to be only when women want to make up their own minds about what they want to do with their lives.<\/p> <p>  The abortion pill is mentioned and there is apparently a DVD that shows the woman how to reverse the effects of the abortion pill once she starts to take it.  There may be doctors here who can answer that question but, from the studies that I have done of the abortion pill, I do not know what is meant by that.  They are proposing an amendment to a Bill that has no medical or scientific basis.  It gives the impression that the proposers do not have a clue what they are talking about.<\/p> <p>  I am particularly interested in this going back to the 1950s when women were pregnant and had to ring around to public and private agencies that might take the child from them.  That is proposed in the amendment.  That was a golden era in Ireland, apparently, from the point of view of the proposers of the amendment, when women were forced to have their children taken from them and given to public and private agencies.  That worked really well.<\/p> <p>  The proposers seem to be living in a time warp where, according to this, a woman is a single woman who has made the decision to have an abortion because she is not being supported by the father, or he is forcing her to have the abortion and paying for it.  It would be great if that was always the case.  There are women who make up their own minds without the father of the foetus being the primary focus.<\/p> <p>  The proposers also do not seem to realise the extent of gender-based violence in this country.  There are many women having abortions because the father of the foetus is violent.  The proposers want them to be consulted and legally forced into their lives.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#E01600","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1882,"content":"<p>Where is that in the amendment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F00100","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1883,"content":"<p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated the father of the foetus was liable for this child.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1884,"content":"<p>Where is any information on the father?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1885,"content":"<p>Will Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n let me speak?

There is factually incorrect information, to my mind deliberately designed to cause hurt and pain to not only the women who have been affected but perhaps the men in their lives and their families as well.<\/p> <p>  Also, there is some wholly irresponsible language in the amendment with reference to the DVD.  I tried to not read too much into it when I was reading this last night.  The idea that non-medically qualified Deputies would try to prescribe in legislation something that, as a pharmacist, I would say is dangerous, namely, to suggest that women would be given information suggesting that they take a medicinal product somehow to reverse abortion pills that they have taken, in my mind could lead to some very serious consequences.  People need to be aware of the irresponsibility and danger in some of these amendments.<\/p> <p>  It is part of our job and what many of us are trying to do to get the best legislation possible, but by tabling amendments that are deliberately designed to cause pain to women and families, it is almost implied that there is a necessity to put this in because if we did not, all these awful things would happen.  In this amendment, we have a very good example of the destructive nature of this grouping of amendments.  There are so many parts to it.  On the reference to the pain of the foetus, we heard the evidence from world experts at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that this is not factually correct.<\/p> <p>  I agree with the previous speakers that it is misogynistic in its essence.  It is irresponsible and dangerous.  It is an attempt to stigmatise women.  As the Minister stated, it all comes down to the notion that the people made a decision to trust women, and these amendments all have that historical contamination of not trusting women.  We would all be, as the public would be, very conscious of what is being tried to be achieved in this amendment, but I do not believe it will not be achieved.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02000","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>First and foremost, our side has never sought to interpret others&rsquo; views in any other way than they have presented them, yet on every occasion there is an interpretation given to these amendments that is not the reason for them.<\/p> <p>  Second, we have never been condescending to anybody with regard to the views that are validly held on the other side of this debate, and we have never name-called or been ignorant in any way with regard to this, because to do so is not in an effort to have debate but in an effort to close down debate.  Closing down debate is in nobody's interest in this regard.  We are entitled to represent the 34% of the people who voted no on this and the 20% of the people who voted yes but who do not agree with this Bill.<\/p> <p>  We also have a right to hold the Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and others to account on the commitments that they give on this issue.<\/p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that abortion is healthcare and is part of the healthcare provisions.  Why then is it illegal to have an abortion in certain circumstances with a penalty of up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment?  Is there any other healthcare provision that happens under proper supervision that has a 14 year prison sentence?  This issue is different from other issues.  We can dance around this point, left, right and centre, if we wish.  We have had certain Deputies state that they want the line taken out stating that a termination of pregnancy is the ending of the life of a foetus because they are not comfortable with it, but that line is at the heart of this Bill.  To ignore that line would mean we would have a euphemistic conversation about what is at the heart of this Bill.  This is also a radical departure from where our health service was in the past.  It is a different situation.<\/p> <p>  Also, the Minister mentioned that in some way we were trying to imply the father's responsibilities legally.  We were not trying to imply that at all.  It is disingenuous for anybody to seek that.  I had a good debate with my colleague, Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, on the parental notification issue for those under 16 years of age where we spoke about the exceptional circumstances that might arise where a minor has been raped by a family member.  When we are dealing with Bills, we deal with not only the core majority of the people who will be dealt with in the Bill but with all of the different parameters that could arise.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger stated we are trying to force the woman concerned to pull the father in some way into the debate.  The amendment does not have any responsibility in pulling the father in.  All it does is provide factual information that exists with regard to the responsibilities.  The reason being is that the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution found that the majority of abortions happen because of socio-economic reasons, because many women feel that they do not have the economic resources to continue with their pregnancy.  We want to say that there are responsibilities with regard to those economic resources.  Economic resources are important.  I have spoken to many women who have said that despite the Minister being pro-choice, they felt they had no choice, because of the economic circumstances that they were in, but to proceed with an abortion.  Indeed, 19 women last year who were homeless had babies.  These types of economic issues radically affect the decisions that people take.<\/p> <p>  The Minister talks about DVDs.  To be honest, the HSE provides information currently in DVD form.  The HSE with which the Minister is involved presents health information now on DVDs.  If the Minister did not know that, that is up to himself.  We are merely saying that the information should be presented in a way that is easily consumable by people, such as in a digital format, by putting it on a memory stick, etc.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02100","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1903,"content":"<p>You could mansplain it in person, perhaps.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Connell will be allowed contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02300","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1905,"content":"<p>Tip around to everyone's house and have a chat.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1906,"content":"<p>I am speaking to the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1907,"content":"<p>Deputy O&rsquo;Connell, please.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#F02600","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1908,"content":"<p>On the age of consent issue, I have always tried to explain that we are happy to effect some changes to some of the content in these particular amendments.<\/p><p>The age of consent is 18 for abortion in many countries including Germany, Spain and 21 other countries in the western world.

I am appalled at the tone of what appears to be an additional part of the Bill that was never flagged to the public at all in the course of the referendum.  When the public voted, they certainly did not do so on the basis of these kinds of conditions.  I have serious doubts about its admissibility because there was no discussion of this nature, nor could there have been one, without causing serious reaction from all free-minded and free-thinking people.  It is extremely old fashioned.  If I were a woman, I would object strongly to being in the control of a system over which I had no control whatsoever.  Going right back to the 1950s or 1940s, not even then were women relegated to the extent proposed in this additional section to the Bill.<\/p><p>There are references made to a digital video disc, DVD.  I presume it is similar to the DVD sent to all Members of the Oireachtas over the past number of years.  Perhaps it is and perhaps it is not.  If it is, then I object strongly to it because it was obscene in the same way that pornography is obscene.  I could not understand why people would want to send that type of material, apart from frightening the life out of the women of the country.  I cannot understand why they would want everyone to have a copy of that DVD.  If one's own family and children, aged under or over 18, were to receive copies of this kind of material they would be shocked.  It would be psychologically damaging to them to feel they had to undergo this kind of propaganda.<\/p><p>There is also another element to this with references to adoption.  I support the legitimate adoption societies that have been involved in providing and facilitating adoptions for people for many years.  I do, however, object strongly to a woman being coerced into a situation whereby, at a most vulnerable time in her life, she is being fed information stating she will be looked after and she need not worry if she follows the directions of the DVD and its providers.  That is the message and it is a dangerous one.  It is taking over the souls, hearts and minds of more than 50% of the population.  If people think that is alright, then on their own consciences be it.  It can and will, however, have serious consequences.  It will take the country back 60 or 70 years.

The Irish courts, as we know, have emphasised the distinction between elective and emergency procedures.  The more elective the procedure, the greater the duty of care on the doctor to warn the patient of potential negative outcomes.  It is clear most terminations of pregnancy, as defined in this Bill under section 13, will be elective procedures.  The law requires that elective procedures require a high degree of disclosure.  The doctor must provide information on benefits, risks and alternatives which will enable a woman to make the best decisions.<\/p><p>In May, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, said he would support the abortion legislation where it allowed abortion for no reason up to 12 weeks.

Informing parents is a reasonable goal but not in the way proposed for all the reasons we have discussed because it would include informing a father who raped his daughter and made her pregnant.  Ultrasound scans are a reasonable idea but we should not force every woman in the country to have them when they are not necessary.  Pain relief in an operating theatre is a reasonable idea but legislation does not reach into operating theatres and dictate which instruments, drugs and procedures our surgeons use in any operation in any hospital or in any general practice.  Informed consent is a good idea but that is not what this amendment does.  This amendment states exactly what needs to be printed on brochures.  I doubt there is any other legislation that determines such matters.  This amendment specifies the technology and platforms to use.  It specifies an IT maintenance programme and security for websites.  As the pharmacist in the room stated, this amendment specifies what she believes could be substantively dangerous medical and pharmaceutical advice.  Yet again, we have the kernel of a reasonable proposal, which is informed consent, brought forward in a way that no legislature anywhere in the world could pass in primary legislation.<\/p> <p>  I want to speak specifically to the start of the amendment because it has been claimed by several of those proposing it that the amendment is nothing more than an offer of information.  That sounds very reasonable.  They are saying they just want to offer women information and who could argue with that?  The amendment states that \"no termination of pregnancy shall be carried out without the voluntary and informed consent of the pregnant woman\".  It then states that consent to a termination of pregnancy \"is voluntary and informed\" only if all the following happens and then sets out a list of mad stuff.

They are framed in such a way that allows us to be asked how we could be against them.  When I returned home last night, as if I had not had enough of this subject after yesterday's proceedings, I thought about the amendment relating to \"dignified disposal\".  The wording of that amendment was carefully designed, as Deputy Donnelly observed, to make it sound as though we were in favour of undignified disposal.  We made very clear yesterday that is not the case.<\/p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to interpretation of an amendment.  I am not sure if he meant my interpretation but if so it was not interpretation.  I have the text before me in black and green.  It is, in my view, an attempt by the anti-choice people to act the victim.  On Tuesday, the first day of these proceedings, we spoke about representing those who voted \"No\".  We should remind people what the people who voted \"No\" voted for.  Their vote meant in effect voting \"Yes\" to people with diagnoses of fatal foetal abnormality travelling abroad and bringing home the remains of their much-wanted children in the boots of their cars.  Their vote was against victims of rape and incest, often minors, being able to access termination.  They voted to maintain the position where nine women per day would travel abroad and for the continuation of the pain and suffering inflicted by the eighth amendment.<\/p> <p>  It was also said that some of us were unhappy with the definition because we were not comfortable with it.  That is completely inaccurate.  I am not happy with it because I believe it is inaccurate and not fully comprehensive.  The Minister has assured us that we will work on this together and I have been working on it to come up with appropriate language.<\/p> <p>  Today, we heard further references to socio-economic factors and the elective nature of the procedure.  This is another attempt to make it sound as though \"on demand\" would see a woman having an abortion one afternoon because she had nothing else to do.  The language in this is an attempt to demean women.  <\/p> <p>  There was a reference to information being medically neutral and factual.  The text of the amendment is not medically neutral or factual.  It was suggested that we could finesse it.  The finesse that I would suggest would be to take a big black marker and score through the lot of it.<\/p> <p>  The only thing anyone is attempting to tamper with here is the bodily autonomy of the women of Ireland, once again.

It is as anyone could have easily predicted, namely, amendments that are full of bigotry and misunderstanding are being presented to us in long texts - reading some of them is like reading <i>War and Peace<\/i>- and we then bicker and fight over them, thereby delaying what we are here to do, that is, legislate for the result of a democratic referendum that was decisively won and which provided that women should have choice and access to abortion in this country.  That is the issue on which we must focus.  People are arguing back and forth over what the T&aacute;naiste did or did not say.  That does not matter because the Irish people spoke in favour of the heads of Bill which were published by the Minister for Health.  That is what we are trying to deal with and this amendment and many other amendments have absolutely nothing to do with those heads of Bill.<\/p><p>We should not give the amendments much oxygen because they are full of what we heard over and over again during the referendum campaign and what people of my age have been hearing for 35 years.

We have been waiting to put legislation through for a long time and each day we waste is another day on which women will be forced to leave this country or, in the privacy of their own homes, to put their health at risk by taking pills without supervision.  I appeal to everybody to remember the outcome of the referendum.

We are at risk of rerunning the campaign here, which would not help any woman in crisis today.  We have had two long days of debate and I am sure we will have another intense day of debate today.  There is a duty on us to proceed through the amendments, give them consideration and move this legislation forward.<\/p> <p>  I will recap quickly on a number of points relating to the amendment.  The title of the proposed new section is \"Information and informed consent\".  Deputy Donnelly is entirely correct that implicit in that is a suggestion that without this section, there is no information or informed consent.  That is not true.  As I outlined, informed consent is long established medical practice, which is enshrined in Medical Council guidelines, the Medical Council being the regulator of doctors which can strike off a doctor.  Informed consent, consent and information exist.  What the Deputies are trying to do is rewrite what the term \"information and informed consent\" means to suit a particular viewpoint.  While they are absolutely entitled to hold it, that view is not objective.  Our medics know what to do to comply with the law and their duties under Medical Council guidelines.<\/p> <p>  Several speakers referred to commitments given by various people.  I gave a straightforward commitment that in the event that the people of Ireland voted \"Yes\", I would move ahead with legislation in line with the general scheme that was published in March.  There may be ways of technically improving that, and we have discussed this from many perspectives over the past two days, but that was the commitment I gave and the reason I am here today is to move it forward.  We debated the general scheme intensively during the referendum campaign.  I heard it debated on radio programmes when people texted in questions and we had head-to-head debates on it, including one between me and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The debate took place very much in the context of the general scheme and the section proposed in amendment No. 146, or anything resembling it, did not appear in the general scheme for good reason.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Nolan stated the amendment was about giving women choice.  Apart from the irony of that comment, it is also not true.  Amendments matter and, as our President says, words matter.  The words of this amendment are very simple.  It uses the phrase \"shall be carried out\" and refers to consent to a termination of pregnancy being voluntary and informed \"if and only if\".  Let us not in any way suggest there is any choice as to whether a woman or her doctor would go through the detailed protocol that those who signed the amendment wish to insert in the legislation.  The amendment does not provide for choice.  If this section is inserted in the Bill, any woman in crisis seeking to access a termination of pregnancy will have to comply with all the various tests set out.<\/p><p>To be clear, there is no choice.<\/p><p> I have made my points about the reference to the father of the foetus, and how I genuinely believe that represents a misunderstanding and suggests there is only  a certain type of woman who needs to access termination.  That is not borne out by the statistics.  That is my interpretation of it and it is my job to outline how I interpret it.  It is also factually incorrect, because it refers to situations \"where [the father] has offered to pay for the termination of pregnancy\".  As we have already discussed at great length, termination of pregnancy in Ireland will be provided for universally as part of the public health service, so no woman will need any man to pay for it.  Let us put that where it belongs.<\/p><p> I really believe that no woman ever wants to find herself in a crisis pregnancy, and the more I have met women in these situations, the more I believe it.  No woman would want it for herself and I would never want it for a woman in my life.  No one wants to be in that situation.  However, if a woman finds herself in that situation for whatever reason, and there is always a reason, we need to make sure the system we put in place is compassionate, sensitive and effective in how it operates.  I do not attach any value judgment to the Deputy's perspective, but I genuinely believe this does not help in achieving that.<\/p><p> As much as I oppose every element of this amendment, I am particularly disappointed that when those who drew it up decided to exclude certain groups from having to go through this rigorous protocol, they still chose to include parents of unborn babies with fatal foetal abnormality.  That is particularly cruel.  Subsection (4) of the amendment refers to a \"suitably qualified person\" - we will get to that point in a moment - sitting down with the mum and going through the features of that foetus and its state of development.  These are people who have experienced fatal foetal abnormalities.  They have probably gone through their 20-week scan, with the great excitement of seeing their baby and looking forward to its arrival, only to find out that their baby does not have a brain or a heart.  It is a particularly cruel aspect that parents like those I have met from Terminations for Medical Reasons Ireland, TFMR, would have some suitably qualified person sit down and explain the features to them in great detail.  I am sure it was not intentional, but it is in the amendment.<\/p><p> The amendment references a \"suitably qualified person\".  I am not sure who that is.  The idea here was that a woman and her doctor would have a conversation, a period of time would elapse and the procedure would take place.  Does the phrase \"suitably qualified person\" mean we are now making it mandatory for a woman to see another person?  She has already sat down and discussed her intimate private life with a doctor.  Does she now have to discuss it with someone else?  I am not quite sure who the suitably qualified person is.  Who Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n would deem to be suitably qualified and who I would deem to be suitably qualified may not be the same.<\/p><p> It is true the HSE produces things on DVDs.  The HSE does a great job promoting lots of things about the Healthy Ireland initiative, positive health and vaccination.  Regrettably some people, although not Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, have opposed the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  I do not care about the modality of the information.  Whether it is on a DVD, stored on a memory stick or uploaded to Netflix, I think it is offensive.  My problem is not the method by which the information is to be communicated.<\/p><p> Finally, one of the reasons people in this country voted \"Yes\" was to make sure that when a woman made a choice she could access the service safely.  During the referendum campaign I heard, as I am sure many committee members did, men and women saying that if it was their daughter they would want her to have support and to be able to talk to her doctor.  They said they would want to know that she was not going on the Internet, ordering an illegal abortion pill and taking that pill in the loneliness of her bedroom or bathroom.  The more hurdles are put in front of women, the more likely it is that the issue of illegal abortions will continue in this country.  I respect all the Deputies here while fully disagreeing with them on this issue.  I do not think any of us can argue it would be a good outcome for illegal abortions to continue and for women to continue to travel.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n should note that 113 women from Meath travelled last year.  We do not want to place challenges in front of these people and I am sure he does not want that either.  We cannot continue to put onerous and unnecessary barriers in front of a service people have told us get on with introducing.  Whether the Deputy agrees or disagrees, I know he respects the will of the people.  We have a duty to make sure it works and is effective, and this amendment simply will not allow that to happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#J00900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":1982,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

During the referendum, much of the debate was consumed by the commitments made by senior members of the Government, as would be expected.  We had a commitment from the T&aacute;naiste that counselling and information would be provided.  They are important things to say.

It states: \"Nothing in this Act shall operate to affect any enactment or rule of law relating to consent ...\".  Therefore, existing legislation applies.  I am particularly interested in two case scenarios.  One relates to where the pregnant woman is under the age of 16.  My understanding is that when a woman is aged 16 or older consent is not required under law from a medical perspective, as the woman is an adult.  Will the Minister advise how this will work for women under the age of 16?  Will the young woman need to a parent or a guardian to accompany her?  Is it expected that forms will need to be signed?  Can it be done at the time?  How does the Minister foresee that working?  My other question relates to the existing law, which is what we are applying here.  It relates to the case of a woman who is over the age 16 but may have an intellectual impairment, an intellectual disability.

It is not directly my job and it is certainly not the job of this legislation.  Page 15 of that document sets out the general consent principles which the Deputy does not need me to go through because he is familiar with them, but under section 10 it specifically refers to the capacity to consent.  Obviously, the capacity to consent test, if I may call it that, would be the same.  It also contains a section on children and young people and how to interpret consent, which we discussed yesterday, with the basic principle being that if one is under the age of 16, one will need a parent to consent on one's behalf.  As the Chairman outlined to us yesterday, there are situations where if there were family difficulties or very difficult situations, that would have to be reported to the appropriate authorities and could be dealt with through those as well.

He knows there is conflict on that view not only in this Chamber but outside it among the medical professionals.  This is not something that has been plucked out of the air.  This is a real concern among many doctors, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and medical professionals who work in the hospitals.  The centrality here is that this Bill seeks to bring in a law that allows for the ending of a human life.  That is a very significant thing for anybody to be involved in.  The referendum was dressed up as choice.  If we are going to fulfil that promise of choice we would obviously make sure that nobody is forced into a situation where he or she has to facilitate or be involved in the ending of the life of a foetus.<\/p><p>Amendment No. 147 states that &quot;no healthcare worker or other person shall be under any obligation to carry out, or to make a certification in respect of, or to participate in carrying out or to make arrangements for the carrying out of, a termination of pregnancy&quot;.  That only relates to sections 10, 12 and 13, and it does not deal with the case where there is a significant threat to the health of the life of the mother.<\/p><p>There is a desire here not to consider international examples because every time we have suggested an international example we have been told we are special and we should just stick to the Irish situation.  Our next door neighbour, the British, for example, have awful problems with this.  They have a stronger freedom of conscience element within their legislation than we do.  The freedom of conscience states that there is nothing in this Bill that will force anybody to carry out an abortion but it does not look beyond necessarily the horizon of this Bill and, therefore, there could be other contractual arrangements or other unforeseen consequences that forces an individual to participate.<\/p><p>This amendment also broadens out participation in an abortion rather than the narrow definition with which the Minister has identified.  It reframes the section and, again, offers clarity.  I was involved in the 2012-2013 abortion discussions and clarity was the goal and lack of clarity was the enemy with regard to that.  The British, for example, are laden down with regular litigation involving the state because of certain individuals, healthcare workers, who are constantly battling, trying to protect their freedom of conscience.<\/p><p>The case of the Greater Glasgow Health Board <i>v<\/i>. Doogan and another is an example of this.  New Zealand has come to the view it is important to have a gold standard with regard to freedom of conscience and the amendment emanates from its legislation, which states <\/p><blockquote>Notwithstanding anything in any other enactment, or any rule of law, or the terms of any oath or of any contract (whether of employment or otherwise), no registered medical practitioner, registered nurse, or other person shall be under any obligation(a) To perform or assist in the performance of an abortion ... <\/blockquote><p>New Zealand is a progressive western democracy where access is not sought to be denied to anybody yet it has managed to process this with an allowance for other individual human beings to have their own choice respected.

Amendment No. 148 looks to delete \"or midwife\" and substitute \"midwife, hospital or institution\".  There is a great argument as to whether institutions have an entitlement to freedom of conscience or conscientious objection.  There are many constitutional reasons to state they do because many of them are run by voluntary organisations that under the Constitution have a right to their particular ethos.  Some might say Fine Gael has an ethos and the question is whether one can prevent Fine Gael from proceeding with that ethos and can force it onto a certain direction.  I would say that should not happen.  Even if we forget about what could happen in the future on this, there is a practical element to it.  Yesterday, I mentioned three hospitals where the majority of health workers have stated they will not proceed.  I will give the Minister more clean information on this today.  The general manager of one of these hospitals has told the CEO of the hospital group it will not participate in the process.  We have the moral argument I am making and we also have the reality in which we are functioning.  To ignore both in the process with regard to institutions would be a folly.<\/p> <p>  To a certain extent we are all talking about the details of this and how it will work but it will engage with the real-life crisis in every element of the health service.  If we are going to create an abortion service we have to make it real-life-proof.  Obviously hospitals are opting out from this even before meeting Dr. Peter Boylan so there is a difficulty for the Minister that has to be recognised.  This is the desire of amendment No. 148.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 149 proposes to delete a subsection and remove the new obligation in the Bill for a doctor who has an objection to making arrangements.  This is one of the most contentious provisions in the Bill for the medical profession.  As I mentioned earlier, the GP system is stuffed at present and is under fierce pressure.  Nobody can get an appointment with a GP for love nor money.  The GPs in my town are not taking on new patients.  If I were to ring a GP now for an appointment, I would be lucky to get it for next Tuesday or Wednesday.  This is the reality.  What will the Minister do to the 650 doctors?  This is a real question.  What will happen to the 650 doctors if they refuse this?  Will they be stripped of their ability to practice medicine?  Will they be brought in some way to a court?  If they continue to refuse will they end up incarcerated?  What penalties will happen to a doctor who refuses to make arrangements?  Making arrangements is an activity.  It is not a passive element.  Other abortion services elsewhere in the world function without it.  I will leave it at that as I know other Deputies want to speak on this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#N00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2022,"content":"<p>We are all agreed the issue of conscientious objection is very sensitive and held very dearly and reasonably by many medics who are opposed to termination of pregnancy.  Many genuine doctors, nurses and midwives throughout the country have been in touch with the Minister, me and all of us to state they have serious concerns about aspects of conscientious objection.  It is incumbent upon us to treat these concerns with the utmost seriousness.<\/p><p>I have some questions.  The conscientious objection section essentially states two things.  It states, &quot;nothing in this Act shall be construed as obliging any medical practitioner, nurse or midwife to carry out, or to participate in carrying out, a termination of pregnancy in accordance with <i>section 10, 12 <\/i>or <i>13<\/i>&quot;.  The conscientious objection is waived in emergencies, in line with all medical law.  Certainly the doctors, nurses and midwives who have been in touch with me do not have an issue with this part of the section.  They understand they are being given an exemption and they do not have to participate in any way.  I have not had a concern raised with me about this.  The second element is the kernel of where people are looking for clarity.  Section 23(3) states &quot;A person who has a conscientious objection referred to in <i>subsection (1)<\/i>shall, as soon as may be, make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the termination of pregnancy concerned.&quot;  I have several questions on both parts of the section, if I may.<\/p><p>The first part exempts from participating in or carrying out a termination and we know from the legislation that it applies to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives.  Does it include student doctors, student nurses and pharmacists, either here or in other legislation?  As for the transfer of care, the question for a clinician reading this will be what does transfer of care mean.  There may be some out there but none of the doctors, nurses and midwives to whom I have spoken have said they will opt out of it and that is the end of the conversation.  What they are asking me is what transfer of care means.  One interpretation, which we discussed yesterday, is the idea that it is to enable the woman to avail of termination of pregnancy.  This could be in a normal case, and not in an emergency case or exceptional case, where a woman is in with her GP who will state he or she will not participate and will conscientiously object but will provide information on the 24-7 helpline staffed by trained clinicians, including doctors, nurses and midwives, give her the phone number and explain there is an opt-in protocol in place for other GPs and that if the woman rings the number, she will be given details of a number of GPs.  One therefore is enabling the woman to avail of termination of pregnancy services.  We could go to the other extreme, which might be interpreted as stating the GP must contact a colleague, transfer the patient files and discuss the case.  Certainly the medics to whom I have spoken have said they are okay with the first of these.  They are okay with telling the woman they are conscientiously objecting and giving her the telephone number of the 24-7 helpline and explaining all of the supports that are there.  Except in cases where it is medically required, they really do not want a situation where they are heavily involved in transferring case notes and finding colleagues.<\/p><p>Will the Minister address those two points, as it might go a long way to dealing with some of the real concerns that exist?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#N00400","speaker":"1436","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2024,"content":"<p>Does the Minister wish to come back in now or wait until we have some other contributions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#O00200","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2025,"content":"<p>It might be useful for me to come in now as Deputy Donnelly has helpfully outlined the key questions.

There is the matter of transfer of care.  Section 17 of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 relates to conscientious objection, indicating that &quot;A person who has a conscientious objection referred to in subsection (1) shall make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the medical procedure concerned.&quot;  I make this point because the phrase &quot;transfer of care of a pregnant woman&quot; already exists in Irish law.  We have been discussing this quite a bit and when we make law in the health area, the regulators of those professions take the law, interpret it and legally proof what it means from their perspective as regulators before transferring it into guidance.  This has already been done with that Act.  Nobody in these Houses has the ability to discipline a doctor or strike off a doctor.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked what would happen to a doctor and a doctor would want to know how the regulator is interpreting the law.<\/p><p>The regulator has already interpreted the law on that phrase on page 35 of the famous book, the <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners<\/i>.  Section 49.1 of the book deals with conscientious objection, stating &quot;You may refuse to provide or to take part in the provision of lawful treatments or forums of care which conflict with your sincerely held ethical or moral values.&quot;  Section 49.2 states, &quot;If you have a conscientious objection to a treatment or form of care, you should inform patients, colleagues and your employer as early as possible.&quot;  Section 49.3 states:<\/p><blockquote>When discussing these issues with patients, you should be sensitive and considerate so as to minimise any distress your decision may cause.  You should make sure that patients' care is not interrupted and their access to care is not impeded.<\/blockquote> <p>Section 49.4, which is the nub of the matter, states:<\/p><blockquote>If you hold a conscientious objection to treatment, you must:- inform the patient that they have a right to seek treatment from another doctor<br \/><br \/>- give the patient enough information to enable them to transfer to another doctor or get the treatment they want.<\/blockquote> <p>The next point is key.  Section 49.5 states, &quot;If the patient is unable to arrange their own transfer of care, you should make these arrangements on their behalf.&quot;  The Deputy has correctly stated that nobody has a difficulty with section 49.6, which states, &quot;In an emergency, you must make your patient's care a priority and give necessary treatment.&quot;  That is the totality of the guidelines and it is helpful in answering the Deputy's questions on scenarios.<\/p><p>If a woman cannot arrange transfer of care, and remembering there are many heads and scenarios in this legislation, a medical practitioner must of course arrange the transfer of care.  That is likely to happen in a hospital scenario.  It relates to a very sick woman, who is perhaps unconscious and whose life could be at risk or who could potentially suffer serious harm to health.  To be honest, the bulk of this conversation is coming from the GP community and I accept the legitimacy and bona fides in raising it.  With a GP, a patient would be involved with a medical consultation.  We have discussed the phrase &quot;medical consultation&quot; a lot.  In such cases, the patient will be able to arrange her own transfer of care and the GP is only required to give her that information.  I hope that genuinely helps the debate.  I have discussed this with members of the Medical Council when I meet them in stakeholder forums and I will meet them again next week as part of a broader stakeholder gathering on the matter.<\/p><p>The Deputy mentioned pharmacists and a 24-7 helpline, and I glad he did.  We discussed this yesterday.  Everybody has been approaching conscientious objection from the doctor perspective but as the Deputy rightly says, we must also approach it from the woman's perspective.  Nobody wants a woman to have to go around trying to find a doctor either.  We have done much work on this outside of the legislation on the 24-7 helpline.  The idea is that doctors will have the opportunity to opt in and have their information available to that service.  A woman needing advice or a service would be able to pick up the phone 24-7, speak to a counsellor, nurse or midwife - a healthcare practitioner - and the woman could be directed to an appropriate place.  I do not see a problem from a legal perspective for the reasons I outlined but there is also the practical perspective.  This legislation should not, in any way, shape or form, be about discommoding women in accessing a legal service.  Nor should it be about catching out doctors who have conscientious objections that they are entitled to have.<\/p><p>I genuinely believe the balance is right.  What we are introducing in conscientious objection in this legislation is not new or a different construct.  It is not more or less onerous than what has existed.  It is exactly what has normally been done.  I am concerned a little about some of the commentary from some medics raising the issue of conscientious objection because doctors know it is the regulator - the Medical Council - that makes the interpretation and they should be very familiar with what I have just read.  I hope that answers the question.<\/p><p>The matter relating to pharmacists has come up a bit.  In the primary care setting from an operational and service perspective, the intention is for the doctor to dispense medication to the woman, thus removing the need for the woman to have to make another trip to another healthcare professional, which would be the pharmacist in this case.  In the hospital setting, I am sure pharmacists would be involved with dispensing and, in some cases, supplying the medication to the doctor.  In that sense there is a role that pharmacists would have.  They already have a code of conduct and it states that pharmacists must &quot;ensure that in instances where they are unable to provide prescribed medication or pharmacy services to a patient, they must take reasonable action to ensure these medicine services are provided and that the patient's care is not jeopardised&quot;.  Information is available on the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland's website with respect to referendum in May and the next steps, stating:<\/p><blockquote>The statutory code of conduct for pharmacists sets out the principles for professional practice and behaviour which patients, members of the public and other health care professionals and society generally require and expect of pharmacists who are registered with the PSI.  The code of conduct is intended to provide support and guidance to pharmacists as they discharge their professional duties.  The code requires pharmacists to ensure that in instances where they are unable to provide prescribed medicines or pharmacy services to a patient, they must take reasonable action to ensure those medicines and services and provided and that the patient's care is not jeopardised.<\/blockquote> <p>These are similar principles to what we have just discussed with respect to doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#O00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2028,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister, as that is really helpful.

It is not covered in legislation and I imagine it should not be as it is an operational matter.  Will the Minister speak to the concerns that some may have about concerns relating to rostering, for example?  In a smaller hospital, for example, there may be a very limited number of obstetricians or midwives.  How are they protected in ensuring they are not rostered into a situation if a colleague is on leave, sick or whatever?  Is it possible they may end up being asked to participate in a termination?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#O00800","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2031,"content":"<p>That is an important point.  One of the reasons it is so particularly important relates to what we discussed yesterday and even the day before about certification.  If an obstetrician certifies a woman for a procedure but goes on leave and the covering obstetrician has a conscientious objection, it demonstrates the importance of rectifying what the Deputy, I and others discussed over recent days.  We will do that between now and Report Stage or we will certainly endeavour to work together to do it.<\/p> <p>  Regardless of a rostering or staffing position in a hospital, the right to conscientious objection should not be infringed.  We must work together with the HSE and Dr. Boylan to ensure the service is operable but we must also ensure we do not attach disproportionate concerns to some matters.  It is highly likely, based on the trends that we know relating to abortion in Irish women so far, that approximately 80% of Irish women who access terminations will do so in the community setting.<\/p><p>We should park the issue of the nine to 12 week period, which I accept is different from what I am about to say.  Other than the nine to 12 week period, the women whose medical well-being the Deputy is discussing are very sick in terms of the risk to their health or life and may well have to be transferred to one of the larger tertiary maternity hospitals.  I do not mean this disrespectfully, but I heard some obstetricians in smaller units in the country campaigning for a &quot;No&quot; vote during the referendum campaign and saying, &quot;The eighth amendment has never prevented me from providing care for such a woman.&quot;  However, that is because such individuals would have transferred their patient to Holles Street hospital, the Rotunda Hospital or the Coombe hospital.  Therefore, it does not really arise in the case of a fatal foetal abnormality.<br\/><br\/>The point the Deputy makes is serious and legitimate.  As the HSE rolls out this system, it has a responsibility to work with hospital management to ensure the staff will be consulted, informed and briefed in order that they will be aware of what conscientious objection means.  There cannot and will not be any pressure on staff to in any way negate their conscientious objection which they absolutely have a right to have.<br\/><br\/>I am somewhat concerned about Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's comments.  I do not doubt his words, but I will not cast a slur on any hospital CEO, anonymised or otherwise, because I need to verify the facts.  A hospital CEO in any voluntary or HSE institution cannot say, &quot;My hospital is not participating,&quot; because it is my clear advice that institutions do not have a conscientious objection.  No hospital will have the right to opt out; certainly no hospital CEO will have the right to say, &quot;My hospital is not doing it.&quot;  I need to ensure we will not exaggerate the significance of this issue.  Prior to the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, we heard many people say, &quot;My hospital will not participate.&quot;  In fairness to the doctors and medics involved, that largely was not the experience.<br\/><br\/>I will read my note for the purposes of the records of the committee.  I do not want to take too long, but I want to be clear.  This is an important issue on and about which we have all had discussions and questions.  Section 23 of the Bill covers the issue of conscientious objection.  It states that where he or she has a conscientious objection, a medical practitioner, nurse or midwife shall not be obliged to carry out or participate in the carrying out of a termination of pregnancy.  In the event that a doctor, a nurse or a midwife has a difficulty in undertaking the required medical procedure, he or she will have a duty to ensure another colleague takes over the care of the patient.  This is in line with section 49 of the Medical Council Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners 2016 which I have read in full.  That section obliges doctors to enable patients to transfer to another doctor for treatment in cases of conscientious objection.  It has clarified how it is interpreted by the Medical Council.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Nurses and Registered Midwives, published in 2014, states:<\/p><blockquote>If you have a conscientious objection based on religious or moral beliefs which is relevant to your professional practice, you must tell your employer and, if appropriate, tell the patient as soon as you can.  If you cannot meet the patient&rsquo;s needs because of this objection, you must talk with your employer and, if appropriate, talk to the patient about other care arrangements.<br \/><br \/>Even if you have a conscientious objection, you must provide care to a patient in an emergency where there is a risk to the patient&rsquo;s life.<\/blockquote><p>Therefore, both the Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, have mechanisms to address non-compliance with their guide or code by doctors, nurses and midwifes.  I am often asked if I am going to sack all of these doctors.  Apart from the fact that it is not my function in law, it is not how the Medical Council or the NMBI discharges its duty.  These things are only said to shock or create a problem; there is not that sanction.<br\/><br\/>I have discussed the fact that the HSE is developing a helpline to assist women to navigate the service for a termination.  It is intended that medical practitioners will voluntarily consent to have their names released to women who are seeking a termination through this helpline.  That will ensure women will be directed to medical practitioners who do not have a conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy.<br\/><br\/>Both the Bill and the existing medical guidelines make it clear that conscientious objection cannot be invoked when the risk to a pregnant woman's life or health is immediate.  Any individual's right to conscientious objection is not absolute and obviously has to be balanced against the competing rights of a patient, particularly the right to life in the case of an emergency.  I agree with Deputy Donnelly - I do not believe doctors or nurses have a difficulty in that regard.<br\/><br\/>I have also outlined what the duty is in non-emergency cases.  There are some amendments tabled by Deputies Br&iacute;d Smith and Coppinger to this section which we discussed yesterday, perhaps by accident.  They are focused on the definition of &quot;as soon as may be&quot; and my decision based on legal advice that it provides for a greater degree of urgency and immediacy than other phrases that laypeople such as those of us around the table might think are more urgent.  The phrase &quot;as soon as may be&quot; attaches a significance to informing the patient as quickly as possible.<br\/><br\/>There is no need to make references to the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, as covered in one of the amendments.  The right to conscientious objection is clearly set out in section 23 and does not require a reference to, nor interrupt the interaction of, the Protected Disclosures Act which is already on the Statute Book and will continue to operate independently of this legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#O00900","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2033,"content":"<p>On the issue of conscientious objection, the Minister quoted from the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

Conscientious objection appears to be provided for in the Bill, but on closer inspection, it disappears completely.  Freedom of conscience is a vital human right according to the European Court of Human Rights.  A person's conscience claims can be religious or non-religious.  What matters is that his or her conscience may lead him or her to object or refuse based on his or her deeply held religious, moral, ethical or philosophical beliefs to do or assist in certain things.  The best known example is conscientious objection to military service.  During the years many people have objected to serving in the armed services or fighting in wars owing to an objection to taking human life.<\/p><p>Many doctors, if not most, are guided by the principle to first do no harm.  The idea of intentionally taking human life will be abhorrent for them.  Furthermore, the assisting in taking a human life is essentially the same as directly taking it.  In the case of abortion the process involves the ending of a human life - there is no ambiguity in this - and after more than 50 years of abortion practices in the UK we see that it clearly involves the intentional destruction of a developing life.<\/p><p> In the Bill the Minister, Deputy Harris, states: \"A person who has a conscientious objection [...] shall, as soon as may be, make such arrangements for the transfer of care of the pregnant woman concerned as may be necessary to enable the woman to avail of the termination of pregnancy concerned.\"  In effect this obliges the doctor to ensure that an abortion is carried out by requiring him or her to make arrangements with another doctor who will perform the abortion.  The fact that the conscientious objector is obliged by law to set up an arrangement to enable a woman to obtain an abortion has been overlooked in the discussions on the Government's abortion plan, as discussed with the Chairman earlier.<\/p><p> The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has made no intent to engage or consult with general practitioners prior to publishing the legislative plan.  Clearly, however, he now wants the new abortion services in Ireland to be GP led.  Abortion is not healthcare in any meaningful sense.  The intentional destruction of an unborn child is not a therapy, nor is it a recommended treatment for any complication that may arise in pregnancy.  Many GPs will be deeply uncomfortable with the ending for no reason of an otherwise healthy pregnancy.  Many Irish people will be deeply uncomfortable with the idea that the local GP practice has developed into an abortion clinic on abortion referral services.<\/p><p> Irish doctors should not be forced by law to choose between their job, their business and their reputation on the one hand, and their conscience on the other.  These amendments reflect the concerns expressed to us by more than 600 GPs in recent days.  We can look at each amendment individually but the key point is that without removing the obligation to make arrangements for abortions we will find ourselves engaged in a massive attack on the rights of our doctors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#P02300","speaker":"1441","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2056,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick.

I will state it briefly but clearly again for Deputy Fitzpatrick, and it is the same thing I said to Deputy Donnelly.  The provision for conscientious objection exists in section 23 of the Bill.  No \"medical practitioner, nurse or midwife\" need participate in any such procedure based on their own views.  They have absolutely every right to hold those conscientious objections and I respect that.  The Medical Council guidelines interpret that.  The council is the regulator, not me.  Section 49 on page 35 of the Medical Council guidelines states this.  I have heard from many doctors also, and I accept there are genuine concerns and practical operational questions.

My amendment No. 157 refers to the issue of conscientious objection.  I believe that we already have comprehensive provision made for any person who wishes to conscientiously object.  I do not hold with the notion that the provision of this specific form of healthcare for women should cause a whole additional layer.  Notwithstanding that, we believe it needs to be codified that there would be consequences for those doctors who refuse care to women.  Asking a doctor to participate in a procedure is not the same thing as asking that he or she ensures that a provision is made for the procedure to happen.<\/p> <p>  Our amendment asks for a referral to the Medical Council for appropriate sanction in the event that a physician refuses to make arrangements for the transfer of care of the woman who is pregnant.  There should be a sanction because we do not believe there should be an opt out and that Ireland should continue to do what it has done for decades, which is to look at women in crisis pregnancy situations and fold our hands, throw our eyes up to heaven and say, \"No, sorry love we are not helping you.\"  That is not good enough.  There has to be an obligation to make a referral for the transfer of care.  I do not believe telling a doctor to make a referral is the same as forcing a doctor to participate in any procedure.  Any Deputy who comes in to the committee and tries to claim this is being somewhat disingenuous.<\/p> <p>  The amendment provides for a referral to the Medical Council for appropriate sanction.  Although I may have had my own views about whether or not a criminal sanction would be appropriate, the amendment does not say that.  It states, \"shall be referred to the Medical Council\".  We are having this debate following on from the referendum, and all of the discussions we had where everybody said there should be no more shame and no more stigma or forcing women to go abroad.  It is about putting the woman at the centre and ensuring she gets the care.  It is about ensuring that if the doctor or physician in front of whom she is sitting does not wish to provide that service then that physician will make a referral onwards.  As I said earlier, I do not believe this constitutes participation in any way, shape or form.  It simply lives up to the obligations to provide care.<\/p> <p>  The Deputies have called themselves pro-life - the opposite of which is anti-life, which is silly - and I do not hold with their notion that this part of healthcare should be separate or different.

We must recognise they have concerns that are entitled to be catered for, and we must cater for them.  I note the 650 doctors who have signed the petition to the effect that they do not propose to participate.  In his reply perhaps the Minister will give some indication of the impact this is likely to have on the overall service available to women in the State.<\/p> <p>  Other branches of the medical service such as midwives, nurses, trainee doctors - to which the Minister has referred - are also important enough to be provided for in the primary legislation for two good reasons.  The first reason is to observe the spirit of the letter of what has been said and promised before.  The second reason is to ensure that it is possible to provide alternative readily available services so that women may be able to know where to go without having to make phone calls or do a check.   They may have to go in an emergency.  They should know before they travel to a particular GP practice if they will or will not receive a service.  They should not have to do two or three journeys to find that out.  I am aware that the helpline will eliminate some of that.  Envisage, however, a situation where a woman might have multiple emergencies - for some reasons outside of her control - and her ability to surmise may be compromised.  At this stage it would be better to have a simplified system; a belt and braces system whereby in the first instance the woman would be able to gain access to a medical practice where she knows she will receive the treatment first hand and where she knows she will not put pressure on the conscientious objector or put her own life - or her baby's life - at risk.<\/p><p>I say that on the basis that people may not have made up their minds about what the procedure should be at this stage, and may change their minds.  The provision of this service is critically important.  I note what the Minister has already said, but it would do no harm to refine it a little to take into account the points I have just raised, with a view to ensuring that the service is available in every region so that the woman does not have to travel 100 miles in order to access basic services.

Everyone believes that nobody should be forced to do something that is against what he or she believes in his or her heart and soul.

I have great faith in the doctors of this country and their ability to deliver this service, and I want to ask the Minister some questions about the doctors who are publicly and vocally objecting.  In the Irish medical profession there is a great tradition of being on the side of women, when it has been allowed.  In Ballyfermot in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s there was a notorious doctor called Paddy Leahy, who has now passed away, who was absolutely brilliant at breaking the law and giving women with 12 or 14 children access to contraception when it was totally illegal.  Dr. Andrew Rynne also faced down the law on the question of condoms and the contraceptive pill.  Doctors for Choice played an amazing role in delivering the result of the recent referendum.  In the 1990s, when it was not popular or profitable to promote abortion services, other doctors really stuck their necks out.  I am not worried at all that we are going to lose medical practitioners over this.<\/p> <p>  I agree that the idea of choice was a key factor in the referendum, and that doctors and nurses should have the choice.  The issue arises as to what happens if a medical practitioner says that he or she conscientiously objects and what happens next.  That is an important issue because transfer of care could mean that doctors will simply provide the phone number for a 24-7 helpline.  It should mean that an employee of the HSE or someone who works on behalf of the HSE who meets a woman in a crisis pregnancy asking for the appropriate help has an obligation, because of the contract the HSE has with that employee, to ensure that the woman seeking help gets the care she needs.  Ultimately it is the responsibility of the HSE.  The way that is provided for in law really matters.<\/p> <p>  I want to leave open the possibility of putting in a different kind of amendment at the next Stage on the question of the ultimate responsibility lying with the HSE itself rather than the doctor.  However, I can foresee hard cases here, and the law as it is written at the moment may not deal with those cases.  Transfer of care might be interpreted as merely providing a freephone 24-7 helpline but will do nothing for a young woman from direct provision or from a marginalised community who only knows about a doctor's clinic.  She may be impeded by the use of language, her inability to speak English, or a lack of money to make phone calls.  There may be many reasons a young woman could not independently look for help outside a doctor's clinic.  <\/p> <p>  We have to be careful not to create hard cases.  Having said that, I am pretty confident that most of our medical practitioners would not be that hard-hearted or so cruel to let somebody walk away in a desperate state.  There may be some such practitioners out there, and we should allow for the possibility of that.  We have to look at how we frame this provision.  We have inserted a clause to say that those doctors must refer the woman on to someone who will treat her.  We do not quite use that language, but it is clear that the transfer of care is the duty of the doctors.  I want to look at inserting an amendment in the future which will make it the ultimate responsibility of the HSE.  <\/p> <p>  As a corollary to the amendment introduced by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n which seeks to allow an institution access to conscientious objection, we have submitted amendment No. 162 which would insist that an institution does not have access to conscientious objection by inserting into subsection (1) that, \"Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed as applying to an institution, hospital or a medical facility\".  We could leave that out, but we believe it would be better in the legislation as an absolute guarantee that there will be no chance that a place like St. Vincent's Hospital can refuse to provide abortion care because it has a Catholic ethos.  Some people are terrified that our future national maternity hospital might have that facility.  We want it to be written into abortion legislation that it does not.  I believe that is a reasonable request.  I take the Minister's point that the legislation includes institutions, hospitals and clinics in good faith.  <\/p> <p>  I have heard that many of the approximately 600 doctors kicking up about this legislation are unhappy because it raises a question about the GP scheme and the payment of GPs in general.  Dr. Carthy would know about this.  GPs lost a lot during austerity; it has been suggested that there were pay cuts of between 26% and 36%.  Those payments have not been restored.  I can imagine that a cohort of GPs would be annoyed that they are now being asked to take on extra work without proper remuneration.  Can the Minister tell us whether that is correct or not?  I do not imagine that there are 600 doctors who are saying that they will not give out the abortion pill.  It makes more sense that there would be 600 people who are discontented about pay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#R00300","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2067,"content":"<p>Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is entirely correct.

The talks are to address the issues the Deputy has referenced, including the sustainability of general practice, where we want it to be in the future and how we are going to resource it.  On the specific issue of resourcing, with GPs to provide the specific new service, I note that in the coming days we will be in a position to issue a contract for the service.  It will be very clear for all to see that we are adequately resourcing general practice to provide the service properly, comprehensively and safely.

We have come back to the use of inflammatory language.  Perhaps that is the view, but it is not really the place we are in right now.  Previously, people spoke about reasons or offering clarity in reference to these amendments.  The Minister has been very clear.  The amendment is completely unnecessary and already provided for.  As a registered pharmacist, I concur with the Minister's reading of the Bill to the effect that pharmacists have always been allowed to conscientiously object.  During the years I personally have had concerns about the idea that anybody in receipt of State payments has had that option, but that is my personal view.<\/p> <p>  Some years ago I had experience in a town where there was a pharmacist who was a known conscientious objector and did not stock barrier or oral contraceptives and refused to stock Cytotec, that is, misoprostol, for the completion of a miscarriage.  My understanding is there was no active referral.  However, it was very well known among girls in the town that one did not go to that pharmacy for the contraceptive pill because one would not be given it.  Happily, there were nine other pharmacies in the town that could facilitate.  There is something like 1,800 retail pharmacies in Ireland and I do not imagine this will pose any problem.  However, I do not mean to womansplain anything here, but as the Minister said, one of pharmacist's roles in the community is to complete stock orders for GP surgeries.  As such, a dispensing process will be involved.  In the hospital environment the pharmacy will dispense for prescribing doctors.<\/p> <p>  I was not going to go there, but there was also a reference to New Zealand.  It is really easy to selectively pluck elements of other countries' legislation and bamboozle committee members as if we would not look it up, but I did.  Under the Contraception, Sterilisation, and Abortion Act 1977, in New Zealand abortion is available on health grounds up to 20 weeks; therefore, the risks of delay are not as great as under the Bill here.  What happens in New Zealand is not at all relevant to the situation here.  A doctor in New Zealand can refuse to consider a woman but must inform her of her right to seek healthcare elsewhere.  The comparison with New Zealand, therefore, just does not work.  It has been statistically proved - it is not merely my opinion - that terminations in New Zealand tend to happen later in the first trimester owing to that longer period. <\/p> <p>  Let us remember that at the start of the week we spoke about women being at the centre of our discussions.  We have to imagine a woman with a crisis pregnancy who is looking for a medical professional's help and how she might feel if she was shown the door.  I am of the understanding one can conscientiously object to treatment but not to a person.  That is a very important point to consider.  <\/p> <p>  The discussion has proceeded as though conscientious objection is a black and white issue.  There is actually a spectrum.  Suggesting an institution could be a conscientious objector represents a complete misunderstanding of the degree of objection within the medical profession.  Let us consider an institution such as a hospital that is in receipt of State funding.  It would be bizarre if it could organise as a collective so as not to provide services for which the people clearly voted.<\/p> <p>  To my mind, we are yet again seeing a sinister strategy to stigmatise the care required, that is, the procedure of termination of pregnancy; to demean and reduce a woman by suggesting she needs more information; to target the medical professionals who want to be conscientious providers of this service; and to drive willing medical professionals to simply give up.  <\/p> <p>  As somebody who has worked in late night pharmacies at weekends and on Christmas Day for several years, I would like to make a point that the Minister has perhaps considered.  There is a need for a book of guidelines for community pharmacists to cover situations where a patient, whom one knows, presents on Christmas day or at 8 p.m.  If we cannot get hold of a GP, pharmacists should know the cascade of options to which we refer if we are caught in a situation with a vulnerable woman.  Obviously, referring her to a maternity hospital seems to be the logical choice, but that is fine for me as a person in Dublin.  A booklet would be helpful for those pharmacists who want to hold it.  I am not saying they should be forced to hold them, but there should be some guidelines for community pharmacists in order that we will not be gazing at women in a crisis not knowing what to do with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#S00200","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2069,"content":"<p>I hear a lot from a lot of Deputies today, as well as in a lot of the motions, about freedom of conscience and how absolutely vital and important it is, but for umpteen years I have not heard from any of them about the absolute right to freedom of conscience where people like me are concerned.  I did not hear about freedom of conscience for people like me when the D&aacute;il prayer was forced on us and we were forced to stand for it, or with reference to the statue of the Virgin Mary one sees in hospitals.  We do not have full freedom of conscience.<\/p> <p>  I am becoming a little concerned as the debate goes on.  Yesterday I said I was not going to come in, but I am becoming quite worried.  It is being suggested doctors, nurses and, as some would love to have it, everybody else will be able to object to providing abortions.  All they will be required to do is tell somebody about a website or a 24-hour helpline.  That is not what I understood by \"transfer of care\".  The Minister needs to be a little more specific.  He was very specific when he wanted to include periods and dates in the law, but he is not being as specific in this instance.  I accept the point he made yesterday that \"as soon as may be\" means a little earlier than we all thought.   However, a specific time should be outlined.  It should be 24 hours, as proposed in one of the motions.  The wording \"as soon as may be\" is a little too vague.  Notwithstanding all of the great doctors in the country, there are some who will actively frustrate women and pregnant people in seeking to have an abortion in this country.  They certainly will.  Some nurses and midwives will too.  They just do not agree or accept that it is a freedom of conscience issue for the woman having an abortion.  They accept freedom of conscience only in their case.  I have visions of women being passed from Billy to Jack.<\/p><p>If one goes to a doctor and is told there is a website and that is the doctor's duty done, that is not enough.  We need to be a little more specific.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#S00300","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2071,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#T00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2072,"content":"<p>I took &quot;transfer of care&quot; to mean that one must tell the woman that another doctor in her locality - there is no point in referring a woman from Dublin up to Donegal or <i>vice versa<\/i>- will provide the termination and has the potential to cater for the woman the following day.  I thought we would be talking about some kind of referral.  The uninitiated among us would read &quot;transfer of care&quot; in that way, so the Minister must explain this.  I wrestled with this issue and whether I would oppose conscientious objection completely.  There is a case to be made as to whether it should be allowed at all because the way in which it operates in some countries is such that it prevents many people from accessing terminations.  We cited examples in Italy, where a culture has been created in the medical community of doctors not participating.  One can see how, with political and social cultural shift in a different direction, this could start to happen here.<\/p><p>How onerous is it for a doctor to write a prescription?  One could surely argue that it is still up to the woman and that the doctor is not actually participating in the abortion.  He or she is giving that choice, that freedom of conscience, to the woman in the situation.  I ask the committee to look at it that way.  One would think doctors were actively being forced to carry out abortions, which none of us agree should be the case.  One is still giving the person affected by the decision that freedom of conscience but one is not carrying out the procedure oneself.  All I am hearing about is doctors and nurses.  I agree with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith that the majority of doctors will participate in this.  Surveys given to the Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution showed that the majority of doctors, like the rest of the population, were in favour of such provision.  I will also be balanced, however.  Doctors did not do enough in this country in recent years to actively move the situation forward.  Even Professor Arulkumaran said after the inquiry into Savita's death that he was surprised doctors did not do a little more in the intervening years.  Be that as it may, doctors are now actively taking part.<\/p><p>I wish to mention some specifics.  Some of the amendments basically imply that this should be broadened to all healthcare workers.  I myself worked in the healthcare system.  If it is broadened, are the Deputies who have tabled these amendments saying a clerical officer could refuse to write a letter of referral for someone or refuse to physically hand a woman a list of doctors in her area?  This seems to be what is advocated in these amendments.  Not alone that, but what if a receptionist in the surgery has a conscientious objection?  There is all sorts of potential here for the matter to be broadened.<\/p><p>The institutions are another matter.  I agree that amendment No. 162 should be adopted.  We probably should explicitly write this into law and it would be good to do so because there is a serious question mark over it.  No one knows what will happen with the national maternity hospital.  I would like the Minister to make it clear that he will not accept institutions conscientiously objecting.<\/p><p>Another matter that has come up recently and on which I would like the Minister to give a commitment is the question of an opt-in system.  I have been contacted by doctors who are abortion providers in other countries.  They have asked me to ensure that such a system is not introduced here because having a list of abortion providers could potentially put certain doctors at risk of attack.  We should not be naive.  There are people who actively oppose this law and we know they pick on clinics.  We know that where they have done so in other countries, doctors and healthcare providers have been attacked and killed.  We know they are guilting and shaming women going into abortion clinics in Liverpool today.  If we are to have an opt-out system, it must have a limit such that the doctor must ensure that the woman is looked after.  Furthermore, we should not have an opt-in system or a list of doctors.  I am also worried about this 24-hour helpline, and I mean this for the protection of doctors and staff who work in surgeries too.  We do not have an opt-in system for the provision of diabetes services or other healthcare.  We should not stigmatise abortion if we can in any way avoid doing so and we should ensure that doctors are protected.<\/p><p>I think there will be enough doctors to provide this service.  I will put this in context because I think it was Deputy Fitzpatrick who raised the question of how the healthcare service will cope.  We do not know the exact figures, but let us say there will potentially be 5,000 or 6,000 abortions per year, adding up the people who travel and those who order the abortion pill online.  We do not know the exact figure for the latter but we have some idea from the two main providers.  The current number of doctors will be able to cope, particularly because much of the service, probably up to 80%, would be medical abortion, which simply requires a prescription.  I am all for protecting doctors' and other people's rights, but at the same time we must ensure that women, particularly those in rural areas or areas where there are not many doctors, are not left behind.<\/p><p>I wish to raise one last scenario.  We had a case two years ago in which a psychiatrist sectioned a teenager who was suicidal and was seeking an abortion.  We never heard what happened but this came out in an article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>a year later.  Doctors who oppose this legislation have a lot of power to frustrate it, so it is important we write into it the limitations of conscientious objection.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#T00300","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2073,"content":"<p>Our next three contributors are Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, Nolan and Mattie McGrath.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#T00400","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2074,"content":"<p>It is interesting how best practice internationally is being solidly ignored in this scenario.

The opposition is not just from what people would call the pro-life side of the debate.  There is fair opposition around the country, left, right and centre, on this issue.  Primary legislation trumps medical guidelines.  Furthermore, this is a change to the medical guidelines.  The Minister mentioned the medical guidelines in respect of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  That was a requirement in respect of abortion in cases in which the life of the woman was under threat and had to be protected.  For a start, the level of conscientious objection that would exist in such a case is zero.  Second, the position would be that the guideline would be deleted if that Act were repealed.<\/p><p>The Chair was very close to nailing it in this situation.<\/p><p> We are introducing a new law and the language in this particular section is the same language as the particular other law, but it is for a different right, not the right to have an abortion in the case where the mother's life is under threat but the right to have an elective abortion in a scenario before 12 weeks for other reasons, and important reasons they may be.  It is a different right.  Therefore the guidelines designed by the Medical Council on this particular issue will not have to give the same level of precedence to passing information, etc.  In actual fact, I have spoken to a number of barristers on this issue and their view is that the Medical Council could not but develop guidelines that actually reflect the law.  They would have to respect the law.  <\/p><p> Where the Minister refers to arrangements for abortions up to 12 weeks without indication, the Medical Council would have to implement that.  That is where the doctors are having the real difficulty.  It is not a replication.  It is a completely new situation, under completely new circumstances, where the Medical Council is going to have to follow the law on this.  That is why my request would be that this needs to be put into primary legislation to deal with that.<\/p><p> On pharmacies, Deputy O'Connell made a point that I wanted to raise.  People do not realise the level of engagement pharmacists have on this.  They purchase stock for their localities but pharmacists in hospitals would have to provide for this situation.  The Minister said that reasonable action was necessary.  Action is not passive.  It is an involvement in a process.  The Bill is forcing the pharmacists to be involved.  We are getting lost in ourselves in a way.  All of this can happen as all of the pro-choice TDs want without forcing one individual to do something that he or she does not want to do.  That is what we are talking about.  We are talking about forcing individuals to do things that are completely against their wishes.

I can see why.  I have met a number of GPs and they have genuine concerns.  They do not want to have any hand, act or part in the abortion process.  It is as simple as that.  The legislation as it stands, which my colleague Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n pointed out, does not provide for full conscientious objection.  It was not voted on in the referendum, if we are to be honest about that.  That 640 GPs have signed a petition suggests that this is becoming a major problem that needs to be dealt with.<\/p> <p>  It is appalling that the Minister did not consult with these GPs or sit down with them.  The doctors' group released a statement, which he may be aware of, stating quite clearly that they felt bullied and disrespected; those are their words not mine.  They have been treated in an appalling manner.  Everybody has the right to conscientious objection.  Let us be straight that it is a human right.  These GPs want no hand act or part in this. Their views should be respected.  The legislation is a weak form of conscientious objection.  It is not given full conscientious objection or respecting their rights.<\/p> <p>  The GPs have also pointed out that as well as the Government the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP,  has also acted in an unfair manner in that it refused to call the EGM until after these amendments are dealt with.  What that effectively means is that the legislators cannot hear the voices of the GPs directly.  We have met them and I know many of the pro-life TDs have had the courtesy to meet them in our clinics and we have been hearing their concerns.  We agree that there is a huge issue here.<\/p> <p>  If these GPs refuse to participate in this process, and I am totally sympathetic to them, what is going to happen?  Are their licences going to be taken?  Are they going to be locked up?  Are we going to have a flood of court cases because that seems to be where we are headed here?  All this is at the end of the day is upholding a fundamental right to conscientious objection.  If we do not accept this very reasonable amendment here, we are headed to a flood of court cases.  Listen to the GPs and respect them.  We are talking here about different choices and views.  We all have our own views and nobody, whether they be a politician or a GP or a health care worker, should be forced into taking part in a process with which they fundamentally disagree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#U02000","speaker":"1440"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2101,"content":"<p>We are about to have a vote on one of the most important questions we could ever be asked, as to whether this legislation, as put forward by the Minister for Health, would change everyday medical practice.  It is no overstatement to say that the Minister has proposed nothing short of a radical change in the model of medical practice and care provided by maternity services in Ireland.  We have been contacted by numerous doctors, as has been said, in everyday practice who are shocked that the draft legislation has been proposed without so much as the slightest consultation with front-line care providers whose patients are pregnant women and their unborn babies.<\/p> <p>  No guidance has been given on the professional liability for the practitioners that may arise in providing abortions under the legislation.  No experts have been consulted on the pathetic conscientious objection clauses that are contained in this Bill which in practice would not protect anything .<\/p> <p>  Despite what the Minister said during the referendum campaign that the law would protect the right to conscience, the so-called conscientious objection clause in the legislation gives no real protections in law for those who do not wish to provide abortions.  It is as simple as that.  Doctors were shocked to discover that even in circumstances where they object to performing an abortion or prescribing abortion medication, they must make such arrangements to ensure that women requesting a termination are able to do so, which I am quoting from the legislation.  The meaning of this is obvious.  Where a doctor objects to an abortion, he or she must still ensure that one is obtained.  The Government's proposed abortion law goes far beyond the law even in Britain where there is no requirement to make arrangements for abortion access.  The health services are full of doctors who want to care for women and their unborn children equally.  Doctors across the country are not willing or able to become abortion clinics for a Government that has no clear plans or budget to radically change our caring patient-centred medical practice.<\/p> <p>  The Minister cannot even handle the record-breaking delays in accident and emergency departments.  This abortion will turn into a similarly badly thought-out mess in court cases, as we have in illness litigation.  We are aware the costs of that and the damages involved, with plenty of cases of cervical cancer and God knows what else.<\/p><p>The Minister has rejected protections for disabled babies from abortion and protections for babies born alive.

It is a two-way process.  If the Minister starts stripping away licences from GPs or locking them up, as he is threatening if they object, he will go down in history as the most incompetent Minister for Health in this country.  Our amendments will ensure that the right to freedom of conscience is protected.  They will avoid pointless and expensive court cases but the expense does not matter.  They will protect GPs in their work.  I am appealing to the Minister but he has set his face against accepting any of them.<\/p> <p>  The Minister refused to meet the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and just met the board of directors.  A total of 640 GPs have signed a letter calling for an extraordinary general meeting but that meeting has been put off until after all amendments have been dealt with.  People can see that it is a total stitch up.  They can see what is going on.  It is the silencing of doctors, of people who provide care.  They do an exceptional job in providing that care.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman knows how tough it is to be a GP.  He campaigned on the slogan, \"No doctor, no village\".  He knows how much people appreciate, need and love their doctors.  This is upsetting doctors.  A full 640 signed the letter and many more who did not sign it have the same issues with this.  Everyone knows how difficult it is to get GPs for rural practices.  It is a problem in my own constituency.  Are we going to just rubbish them?  Are we going to tell them to eat cake and shut up?  GPs released a press statement today.  They have concerns regarding the total lack of consultation by the Minister and the ICGP board, which is disturbing.  Many GPs on the ground do not believe general practice is the appropriate setting in which to deliver abortion because of a lack of capacity in an already overstretched environment.  They also cite a lack of training, the limited availability of ultrasound and the need to deliver a genuine freedom of conscience protection for doctors who do not want to be involved in overseeing abortions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#V05200","speaker":"1347"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2154,"content":"<p>The Deputy just read that out.

Essentially, this section makes termination of pregnancy services free and they would be provided through the HSE.  One of the subsections states that the services referred to shall be provided otherwise than as inpatient services.  This might be relatively simple, but as I read it a concern arose for me.  The preceding paragraph states that the HSE shall make available without charge medical surgical and midwifery services for the purposes of termination of pregnancy in accordance with sections 10 to 13, inclusive.  The paragraph goes on to state that those services should be provided otherwise than as inpatient services.  I may be wrong but my concern is that for an outpatient or a patient in a general practice the services would be free but once the woman moves to being an inpatient the services would no longer be free.  I wish to clarify whether I am correct in thinking that.  I believe the services should be free regardless of whether a woman is an inpatient or an outpatient.  Can the Minister give some clarity on that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#Z05300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2271,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Donnelly for raising the matter.  It is absolutely the intention that termination of pregnancy services will be free both in the community and in the hospital setting.  The amendments to the Health Act 1970 mirror the provisions of that Act as they relate to services for attendance to the health of women in respect of motherhood.  Thus, women in receipt of services in accordance with the Act of 2018 are not discriminated against in terms of eligibility.  The proposed section 62A(2) contains identical text to section 62(1) of the 1970 Act.  This is to make it clear that section 62A never applies to inpatient services because inpatient services are dealt with in sections 51 to 55, inclusive, of the 1970 Act and the necessary amendments to those sections are contained in sections 25(b) and 25(c) of this Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#Z05400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2272,"content":"<p>That explains my confusion.

If we are to make termination of pregnancy services free - I agree we should and must and I support that being provided for in this section - then we must make all maternity services free at the same time.  They are to a large extent, in fairness, but it is not the case across the board.  Some drugs that can cost a great deal of money can be prescribed.  Sometimes women have to go in and out for intravenous treatment and acute setting services.  In some cases the maternity costs to a woman can end up running into the thousands.  I hope any cost on the Exchequer of implementing this measure would be limited.  Nevertheless, I am keen to see a situation whereby all maternity services are free.  It would be perverse otherwise to have termination of pregnancy services entirely free but not pregnancy services entirely free.<\/p> <p>  There is a second aspect to this that we should grasp as an opportunity.  We should make all contraception free as well.  For example, some of the longer acting contraceptives are highly effective but can cost hundreds of euro.<\/p><p>There is the morning-after pill.  We could, for example, have a situation - that no one would want - whereby the morning-after pill might require a visit to a GP or &euro;50 to get it from a pharmacist but a visit to a GP for an abortion pill would not incur a charge.

In respect of the phrase \"all maternity\" services, people engage in many things during pregnancy that we could never expect the State to cover, such as yoga and well-being classes.  The term \"all maternity services\" would cover a very broad church.  On the drugs issue, Deputy Donnelly mentioned a particular drug, Cariban, used for some cases of morning sickness.  He did not mention this today but he did reference it in another meeting, I cannot remember which but I think it was the Joint Committee on Health.  It costs money - off the top of my head I think on average it is about &euro;30 for a 21 day supply in the pharmacy.  That drug, however, is not licensed for the indication for which it is being used and it is being prescribed off-licence.<\/p> <p>  I always caution against the provision of drugs that are licence-free.  We do not often do that in this country.  I want to highlight that.  Regarding reversible long-acting contraceptives such as the coil and implant, it is untrue to state they cost hundreds of euro.  A coil, give or take, costs about &euro;140 on average and there is also an insertion cost.  A coil covers contraception for five years, so when the fee is divided by five it is not that expensive.  From my experience I have found that the combination of the expense of having a baby coupled with the price of a coil and a doctor's consultation means that sometimes the amount of money required is outside of people's limit in a pressured financial situation after having a baby.  I completely support the suggestion of free contraception, as it was my suggestion at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  That was based on the evidence that we saw which, from memory, was that 44% of people said contraception failure was part of the reason.  On the morning-after pill in the community pharmacy setting, I believe that in the early stages the Minister for Health made it available free to medical card holders in the community pharmacy setting at the weekend to avoid people with medical cards being unjustly treated.  My knowledge of the morning-after pill is that it is between &euro;20 and &euro;30 on average in the community setting.  It is means tested as part of the medical card so it is deemed to be for people who have the means to pay, if the committee understands what I am saying.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#AA00400","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2279,"content":"<p>I do not want to delay but I will make one brief statement.  There are ancillary recommendations from the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  I did not submit amendments to them in the interests of getting this legislation passed speedily.  What is being advocated here is straying into that territory.  I have no problem with that.  This committee has a right to do that.  There are, however, things like sex education on which we have a Bill still stuck on Second Stage.  The Minister might move it along.  I refer also to free contraception.  They are all related.  Perhaps we can reserve the right to put them in on Report Stage, if only for the historical record.  This has to go through the Seanad as well after it comes back here in two weeks or whatever.  Perhaps we can get a timeline.  We did not put in all of the elements referred to in the interests of getting this Bill passed by December.

I can argue, technically, as to whether this should be debated as part of this legislation, but Deputy Donnelly putting these amendments down is important.  All of us here are concerned, as Deputy Donnelly correctly said, about reducing crisis pregnancies.  Commitments, or certainly, recommendations were given in the all-party committee report on the eighth amendment in respect of ancillary recommendations.  I hate the word \"ancillary\" because it somehow or other seems to suggest they were afterthoughts.  They were not.  They were fundamental to the deliberations of the committee.<\/p> <p>  All of us who campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote stated we were going to legalise termination but we were also going to put other supports in place.  I have heard my own position misrepresented on this and I want to be clear.  I want to see free contraception in this country.  Free contraception for women is going to require changing primary legislation.  It is also going to require some clinical advice and guidance for the reasons Deputy Donnelly gave.  There are different types of contraception.  At the moment, many women, probably over 40%, have access to free contraception through the general medical services, GMS, scheme.  Unlike men, women require a visit to their GP, generally, to be prescribed contraception so it is governed under the GMS scheme.  We will, therefore, require primary legislation to be changed and a clinical input as to what is the best thing to do for women.  I am committed to doing both of those things in 2019.  I am also committed to working with the Joint Committee on Health as perhaps the best forum where we can work on a cross-party basis to try to identify how best to progress that.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputies acknowledged the maternity and infant care scheme does largely provide for free maternity services.  We went through this yesterday and I will not go through it again.  I will just say that there are free visits to the GP, further examinations during pregnancy, free visits to the maternity unit and if a woman has hypertension or diabetes there are additional visits after the birth of the baby.  The GP will examine the baby at two weeks and both the mother and baby at six weeks.  Mothers are entitled to free inpatient and outpatient services in hospitals in respect of the pregnancy and birth and are not liable for any of the standard inpatient charges that the rest of us experience as we go about accessing the health service.  We also have free GP care for under-sixes as well.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right about some drugs.  Cariban was mentioned by my colleague, Deputy O'Connell.  She dealt with the issue that it is an unlicensed drug.  Legislatively, the Oireachtas gave the power to the Health Service Executive to decide on the reimbursement of drugs and not to the Minister of the day in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The long and the short of it is that what Deputy Donnelly is trying to do is good.  It aligns with what I want to do.  I do not think we should put in a report about the broader issues in this legislation but I am happy to give a commitment that I will report to the Joint Committee on Health etc.  I would rather not put it in this Bill because I do not think it is a good fit.  It is, however, important to highlight it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#AA00600","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2281,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#AA00700","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2282,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2283,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 171 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2284,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 172:<\/p><blockquote>In page 17, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall lay before the D&aacute;il, no more than 3 months after the passing of this Act, a report on the costs and implementation plan for the Health Service Executive to make available without charge medical, surgical and midwifery services, including provision of prescribed drugs, for the purposes of pregnancy for women who are ordinarily resident in the State.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#AA01000","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2285,"content":"<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2286,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 173 and 174 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2287,"content":"<p>Section 25 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2288,"content":"<p>SECTION 26<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2289,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 175 not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2290,"content":"<p>Section 26 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2291,"content":"<p>Sections 27 and 28 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1541683800,"counter":2292,"content":"<p>TITLE<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2293,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 176 to 180, inclusive, have all been discussed with amendment No. 1.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HES2018110800002#AA01900","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1541683800,"counter":2294,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 176:<\/p><blockquote>In page 5, lines 5 to 11, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;An&rdquo; in line 5, down to and including &ldquo;Act 1997;&rdquo; in line 11 and substitute the following:&ldquo;An Act to ensure that pregnant women may have equitable access to abortion care in a safe and timely manner, and at no cost, and for that purpose to amend the Health Act 1970 and certain other enactments; to make provision for reviews at the instigation of a pregnant woman, or a person on her behalf, of certain medical opinions given in respect of pregnancy;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote> <p>We have had an extensive discussion about this and I have made the views of my party known as to what this legislation should convey and I do not propose to delay it.

I know we want this Bill passed into law as soon as possible but it must be right.  Based on the three days of debate we have just completed, a great deal of work remains to be done and the Minister has agreed that he needs to consider many issues.  My understanding of what will happen next is that the Minister will consider the three days of debate.  He has offered to provide members with access to clinicians regarding some of the issues and has undertaken to meet the committee informally.  That will probably be a long meeting because a significant number of issues need to be discussed.  I understand the Minister will provide members with his proposed amendments or set out his detailed thinking and we will subsequently have time to craft and submit our own amendments.  As the Minister did not propose amendments on Committee Stage, other than one on reporting, the Committee Stage debate was a little like a pre-legislative scrutiny session in respect of some of the issues.  I guess what we are seeking is a mid-legislative scrutiny session.  Is that the Minister's understanding?
