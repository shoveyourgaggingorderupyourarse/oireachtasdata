Apologies have been received from Deputy Cullinane and Deputy Pat Buckley is substituting in his place.  Deputy James O'Connor is substituting for Deputy Cathal Crowe.  Apologies have also been received from Senator Martin Conway.  We are joined by Deputy David Stanton.<\/p> <p> I will deal with one item of committee housekeeping.  Can I take it the draft minutes of our private meeting of 24 November 2021 and public meeting of 1 December 2021 are agreed?  Agreed.  <\/p> <p>  Before I introduce the witnesses, apologies have been received from the HSE advising that many of its senior people who are due to address us this morning are involved in the response to the storm that is hitting the country at the moment.<\/p> <p>  Some members expressed concern prior to the commencement of public session of the meeting that the time limit of an hour or an hour and a half for the meeting is not sufficient.  Deputy Hourigan has a proposal in that regard and Senator Black will second it.

It will be very difficult to reschedule a meeting when we have already had a partial meeting.  I have real concerns about the level of information we have already received.  I am also awaiting replies to a number of outstanding parliamentary questions from the Department of Health and the HSE.  We should reschedule the meeting on an agreed date.  I suspect Senator Black has a comment to make on possible date for a rescheduled meeting.
