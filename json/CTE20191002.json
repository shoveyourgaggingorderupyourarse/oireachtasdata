I want to acknowledge the enormous amount of work that has been undertaken by the health sector at a governmental level, from the Department of Health, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and so many others.  I also want to acknowledge those beyond the governmental and State level, namely the stakeholders we have been working with collaboratively - the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and so many others -  in preparations in the official, agency and industry sectors.<\/p> <p>  I want to assure the committee and, more important, the public that we are focused on being as ready as we possibly can be.  We are well prepared to troubleshoot issues as they arise in the days and weeks following Brexit and to minimise any disruption to citizens.  I also want to assure the committee that a citizen of Ireland will be able to access the same health services after 31 October.  Patients will continue to avail themselves of health services on an emergency and planned basis when travelling to the North or the UK.  There is a commitment on the part of both Departments that the established North-South co-operation in health matters will continue.  This is so important, as has been the goodwill and a deep embedded culture of working together North and South when it comes to health matters.  <\/p> <p>  At the request of Government, my Department finalised legislation yesterday which we brought to Cabinet to provide benefits to residents of Northern Ireland similar to the those of the European health insurance card in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This is something that has been very much welcomed by all parties in this House, in Northern Ireland, and by society in the North in general.  This was an idea that we had already dealt with in the Brexit omnibus Bill, in terms of North-South and east-west reciprocal health arrangements.  We have gone a step further here where, if a Northern Ireland citizen finds himself or herself ill while on holidays in Spain or France or somewhere else in the EU, we have agreed to assist them in meeting the costs.  With the co-operation of the Oireachtas and this committee, Chairman, my intention is to pass that Bill into law in advance of 31 October; I look forward to working with the committee in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Supply lines for drugs and medical devices are all being examined.  Significant buffer stock is already held within the domestic supply chain.  There is no need to stockpile medicines by either a patient, a pharmacy or a hospital.  This is an important message for our citizens and for our health service to hear.  To do so would hamper access to medicines by those who need them when they need them.  <\/p> <p>  Brexit has been a key focus for all of us but there are many other ongoing health service issues.<\/p><p> I understand the Chairman has invited the executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office to attend a meeting of the committee later this month.  As such, I will not dwell too much on that aspect other than to say that since we last met, we have taken several significant decisions towards the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One of the most significant of these relates to the publication of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on removing private practice from public hospitals.  I have made clear my view that this should be done.  It is entirely unfair and inequitable to have private practice continuing unabated in public hospitals while public waiting lists lengthen in many specialties.  It is an unfairness that must be addressed.  I hope there is similar clarity from all parties in the Oireachtas on the need to tackle this issue.  I accept that many colleagues here have offered that clarity, but it is not forthcoming from some others.  The expert group did a good job of tackling this complex issue and I thank Dr. Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir and his team for their work.  I intend to consult with stakeholders and colleagues before returning to Government later this year with a response to the recommendations and an implementation plan.<\/p><p> Another significant development is our decision regarding the restructuring of the health service, the effective dismantling of the HSE as currently constructed and the establishment of regional entities.  Since I was last before the committee, we published the capital plan, which outlines more than 250 projects across the country, the provision of 480 new beds, 30 new primary care centres, 58 community nursing units, and significant investment in mental health and disability projects.<\/p><p> We are planning for the winter period, which is essential to do.  I hope to be in a position to announce additional resources for winter planning as part of budget 2020 to reduce delayed discharges or transfers of care, get people back into the community, increase home care provision and improve access to the fair deal scheme and to transitional care.  I expect the chief executive officer of the HSE will comment on the significant work being done by the HSE in this area.<\/p><p> Next Thursday, we will launch the HSE's flu vaccine campaign.  This year, for the first time, on foot of a recommendation from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, a quadrivalent vaccine will be offered, which provides a substantially greater level of protection to the population compared with the vaccine given in recent years.  We have had good leadership from politicians across the political spectrum on the promotion of vaccination efforts.  I note that Deputy Kelly spoke recently at the Global Vaccination Summit about the importance of vaccination programmes.  I ask all members to encourage at-risk groups to get the vaccine, including healthcare professionals.  More broadly, we must continue to emphasise our support for vaccination programmes and work to debunk the myths associated with them.  I could say a great deal more on this, but I must allow time for the other speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#D00300","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":9,"content":"<p>Thank you, Minister.

I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer; Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer; and Mr. Liam Woods, national director of acute operations.  The Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2019 commenced on 28 June 2019.  On that date, the newly established board of the HSE met, with the Minister in attendance.  Under the Act, the board is now the governing body of the HSE, accountable to the Minister.  I look forward to working with the board and providing every support and assistance to the members in their work.<\/p> <p>  A key priority for the HSE is to maximise the provision of safe services, within the funding with which we are provided.  This is a significant challenge for the HSE in the context of the increasing level of demand for our services.  Demand is rising due to an aging demographic, more complex service demands and ongoing societal and economic change.  The latest reported financial position, as at July 2019, shows a deficit of &euro;281 million, or 3.1%, with 43% of that relating to operational service areas and 57% relating to pensions and other demand-led areas.  The comparable figure for the same period in 2018 was 72% higher at &euro;485 million, or 5.8% of the budget, with 80% of the deficit in the operational service areas.  The greatest cost pressures within our operational services are in respect of providing residential placements to service users with an intellectual disability and the provision of specialist emergency care within the acute hospital setting to a growing population of older and frailer patients.<\/p> <p>  Costs in respect of pensions, the State Claims Agency, the primary care reimbursement service and overseas treatment are largely driven by policy, legislation, demographics and the macroeconomic situation and are not generally amenable to normal in-year financial management.  I have directed relevant national directors, community healthcare organisation chief officers and hospital group CEOs to identify and put in place additional measures to limit, to the greatest extent practicable, any overruns within operational services.<\/p><p>The measures to limit overruns include greater emphasis on controls around agency spend, overtime and staffing levels.  Monthly expenditure limits have been agreed and are being monitored closely, including at a monthly financial management meeting which I chair and all the community healthcare organisation chief officers and hospital group CEOs attend.  This is a challenging process but we are committed to embedding an improved culture of delivering within the budget allocated to us by the State.  Doing so will put us in a stronger position to secure investment for the future, which is in the best interests of patients, service users and their families.<br\/><br\/>The 2019 HSE capital plan, which was recently launched, forms part of a rolling ten-year investment plan for health.  Modern infrastructure and equipment are a crucial part of the provision of a quality health service and, ultimately, a positive patient experience.  An allocation of &euro;642 million was allocated this year to continue the delivery of more than 91 projects across the country and initiate another 73 projects for acute and non-acute services.  Fifty-eight community nursing units, CNUs, are at planning and design stage and &euro;85 million has been allocated to deal with infrastructural risk, replacement of equipment and replacement of ambulances.  This investment will provide increased capacity across the health service and support the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2019 provided for the establishment of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office at the Department of Health, with &euro;20 million allocated for the establishment of a ring-fenced Sl&aacute;intecare integration fund.  This fund will test new ways in which we can bring care closer to home, including putting the patient and client at the centre of service design and delivery.  Across the country, 122 projects have been selected for funding.  A total of these are from HSE or HSE-funded services and include projects supporting individuals to prevent and manage their chronic conditions and projects to enhance community care services and mental health support services.  These projects will run for a period of 12 months from initiation and processes will be put in place to enable successful projects to be scaled for national implementation over time.<br\/><br\/>The HSE and the Sl&aacute;intecare programme implementation office are working to progress the full range of Sl&aacute;intecare reform programme actions and projects.  We have also been working to establish higher-order priority work programmes over the next two years, which have the potential to transform the way care is delivered and experienced in Ireland.  These programmes will be jointly led and implemented by the Department of Health and HSE and will cover the design and implementation of regional health areas.  This is essential in ensuring we have better enabled delivery organisations fully focused on delivering services that meet the needs of the local population.  In addition, the priority programmes will deal with service capacity and service access.  This will address the implementation of the health service capacity review recommendations across acute hospital and community care services, while also reducing the inevitable demand for beds in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>Winter preparedness planning is a core component of annual operational planning in the health service.  It is essential to ensure service provider organisations are prepared for the additional seasonal pressures associated with the winter period.  Analysis has shown significant levels of growth in emergency department attendance and admissions over the past winter seasons, outstripping population growth by more than 2.75%.  The winter preparedness plan was developed by the HSE through a collaborative process across all key services, including community operations, acute hospital operations and the national ambulance service.  The plan sets out the core components of an integrated winter plan and seeks to guide those developing their local plans in terms of essentials that must be considered.  Through this proactive planning and action, combined with the assistance of the public in following winter season guidance from the HSE, including availing of the flu vaccine programme, we will endeavour to provide safe and efficient services.<br\/><br\/>In August of this year, the HSE launched the new gender neutral human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine programme for girls and boys in their first year of second level.  Information packs for parents are being provided through schools by the local school vaccination teams, which have now started to give the first dose of the vaccine.  The implementation of this new programme is backed up by campaign materials including videos, social media posts, radio advertisements and the <i>hpv.ie<\/i>website.  The provisional uptake of the HPV girls' programme is approximately 70% for 2018 to 2019, which is an increase from 64.1% in the previous school year.  It is important to acknowledge the powerful work of the late Laura Brennan in promoting the HPV programme.  She made an enormous impact in communicating the benefits of this important life-saving vaccine and encouraging parents to get informed via the Get the Facts resource.<br\/><br\/>The new paediatric outpatient and urgent care centre, Children's Health Ireland, at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown opened in July.<\/p><p>This opening is a major milestone in the new children's hospital project.  Since opening, the latest available figures indicate that 645 children presented to the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital and 94% of children were discharged home.  The average time spent by patients in the urgent care centre is 112 minutes.  The urgent care centre will continue to extend the hours of operation on a phased basis.  It is expected that 25,000 children and young people will visit the urgent care centre every year, leading to a reduction in emergency department attendance for children.<\/p><p> Since opening, the latest available figures indicate there were 514 attendances to the Connolly Children's Health Ireland outpatients department.  When fully operational, this new facility will provide 17,000 outpatient appointment attendances annually.  This new facility and service is a welcome development and will contribute to significant reductions in general paediatric outpatient waiting times for patients and their families.  I thank Children's Health Ireland and all concerned for their work and commitment in getting this facility operational.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>We agreed to a period of 12 minutes for each member for questions and answers and there will be a second opportunity to ask questions if everybody observes this limit.

What is most interesting about the opening statements is what is not in them.  The hospital consultants, nurses, midwives and allied health professionals are saying the public health system is on fire.  They are talking about more than 1 million people waiting for healthcare.  That was not mentioned anywhere in any opening statement.  More than 500,000 men, women and children are waiting to see a consultant but that was not mentioned in any opening statement.  Already this year 10,000 women and men over the age of 75 have waited on trolleys in emergency departments for more than 24 hours.  That also was not mentioned in any of the opening statements.<\/p> <p>  When the Minister's predecessor, the now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, held office in 2015, he said the Government would ensure no man, woman or child would wait more than a year and a half to see a consultant.  It was pointed out at the time that even if the Government hit that target, the waiting list in Ireland would be the longest in Europe.  That was the extent of the ambition of the target.  In 2015, the then Minister and now Taoiseach said the number would be zero and when the current Minister took office in 2016, that number was 13,000.  An extra &euro;3.5 billion has been allocated to health spending since but that number has increased from 13,000 to 106,000 men, women and children now waiting more than a year and a half to see a consultant.  For every one person who was waiting three years ago, there are now seven.  That is a crisis in anybody's book.  None of this has been mentioned in any of the opening statements.<\/p> <p>  What does the Minister say to all these people and why has he not mentioned this crisis in his opening statement?  Why has the HSE not mentioned the crisis in its opening statement?  What does the Minister say to the 10,000 men and women over 75?  What does he say to the 106,000 men, women and children waiting more than a year and a half for an appointment?  What does he say to the children with special needs in our county waiting three and half years for help?  Why has he not spoken about any of this and what does he have to say to them as they wait and suffer, with many of them deteriorating while they seek access to the public health system in Ireland?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#G00300","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>It is kind of ironic that I come to a health committee meeting and when I am asked not to deliver my opening statement but to take it as read, the second comment from a member of the health committee critiques what is not in the opening statement.  As the Deputy knows, opening statements are a brief summation of some current issues.  He knows the meat of these meetings comprises what we discuss through questions and answers.  If the Deputy so wishes, the next time I attend this committee I can provide a lengthy opening statement and read it in great detail.  Deputy Alan Kelly and others would rightly criticise me for doing so.  I ask Deputy Donnelly not to be pedantic in that regard.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy will note that a significant portion of my opening statement speaks to the greatest potential crisis facing our country at the end of this month, which is Brexit.  He might excuse a Minister coming before a sectoral committee and highlighting what the Government and its agencies are doing about it.<\/p> <p>  I say to the people mentioned by the Deputy that we absolutely must do better.  Since I became Minister, fewer people have waited for a hospital operation.  Fewer people are waiting today for a hip or knee operation or a cataract procedure.<\/p><p>I say to those people that when Deputy Donnelly's current party was last in office, it did not publish outpatient waiting list numbers.  When Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was Minister for Health and Children, he did not publish statistics for the outpatient waiting lists and we had did not have a clue about them.  It took my party and Deputy Kelly's party to go into government and decide to publish those numbers.  A Fine Gael-Labour Government was the first to publish them.<\/p><p> I say to those people that we have agreed a reform plan for the next ten years, which we have never done before in the country.  It is Sl&aacute;intecare and I think we all agree on it.  It will reorientate healthcare.  We have made major progress with inpatient waiting times.  In fairness, the Deputy's party has played a constructive role in that, which I acknowledge.  We have not made anywhere near as much progress as we need to with outpatients.  We will have to reorientate the health service to do it.  What does that mean practically for somebody waiting today?  It means the new GP contract, which I agreed with GPs and which 95% of GPs voted in favour of because they recognised it as a good deal for general practice, will see from the start of next year conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure being treated in the community for the first time.  These conditions treated through the outpatient process currently.  I hope members have visited Connolly Hospital's urgent care centre to see the facility at work.  As its chief executive said, it means approximately 500 more kids on the outpatient waiting list will be treated, as it targets those who are waiting longest.<\/p><p> The Deputy specifically referred to consultants.  Earlier this week, I wrote to the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, inviting its representatives for talks next week on how we can sort out some of the consultant recruitment and retention issues, which are very real.  Those talks will begin with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and my Department on how to resolve those issues.  We sat at this committee last year discussing how to sort out supporting general practice and we have done so.  We worked our way through with nurses a deal that came about, although admittedly after industrial action.  We need to do the same with consultants as we need more of them.<\/p><p> This will require a multifaceted approach and doing a number of things, including shifting more to the community, which is exactly what Sl&aacute;intecare is starting to do.  We will have to ask our GPs to do more and give them more resources.  There will have to be more consultants in hospitals.  I fully accept the points made by the IHCA and IMO about consultant numbers.  There is no disputing those numbers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#G00400","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":17,"content":"<p>The problem is there is nothing wrong with what the Minister has said.  All of those things must happen but we have been listening to similar explanations for years.  The reality is things are getting worse and faster.  We have gone from 13,000 to 106,000 people waiting more than a year and half for an appointment.  That has happened in just three years.  The Minister is correct as the one measure that seems to be working relates to the inpatient waiting list and surgery.  However, that is working because the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been turned back on.  It worked very well in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and it brought waiting times down to months.  It was turned off and the numbers increased again.  I acknowledge the Minister's indication that having it turned back on again was a Fianna F&aacute;il priority.  It is working and we believe it needs to be expanded.  This should not be a long-term measure, as we need a public health system that can deal with this, but it is required for the short term.<\/p> <p>  I can bring this to an individual case.  Last night I spoke to a mum in Wicklow whose child has been waiting three and half years for therapy.  She was very annoyed.  On the same day received a letter from the HSE stating there had been further delays and the child would not be seen, she received a leaflet from the Minister indicating Rugby World Cup dates.  She asked how taxpayers' money can be spent on a leaflet indicating world cup dates but not for her son to have therapy over three and half years.

I echo the Taoiseach's words yesterday.  What staff and patients at University Hospital Limerick want to know is what are we going to do about it.  I cannot remember when, but I visited Limerick a couple of months ago, I visited CervicalCheck staff.  I called into the hospital where I saw the significant progress being made in the development of the 60-bed ward block.  The mid-west has been really badly treated in the reconfiguration agenda which I do not intend to reopen.  I see why it was decided to centralise several services in University Hospital Limerick, but it was never given the beds required.  I see the clinical director of the hospital, Dr. Gerry Burke, regularly highlighting the inequity in bed numbers.  I will reverse that trend and the Deputy will be pleased to know that it is not just talk from me.  If she visits University Hospital Limerick, as I know she does, she will see that work on the 60-bed ward block is well under way.  In this Oireachtas I have been under significant political pressure from Senator Kieran O'Donnell, Deputy Kelly and others from the mid-west to move ahead and do something quickly.  We went ahead with the 60-bed modular ward block.<\/p> <p>  I also see in the figures I have been given that about 68 additional staff have been hired in Limerick in the last four weeks, including 48 in nursing.  The chief executive may wish to add to this, but we are genuinely putting extra staff and beds in place.  As to what we can do right now, I have called a meeting tomorrow on the position at University Hospital Limerick and in the mid-west.  I expect people to come from the hospital, but I also expect to meet the HSE and the Department.  One of the issues about which I heard from hospital management when I visited and about which I have heard from Oireachtas colleagues is that the number of delayed discharges from the hospital is much higher than it used to be.  Traditionally, there would have been about eight, but that number has now reached 47 or 48.  <\/p> <p>  I have been talking to the chief executive about increasing funding for transitional care services in the region.  I offer my apologies to Deputy Harty, as I should have mentioned the representations he has made in that regard, but I was looking in his direction.  We will also be making provision for winter planning in budget 2020 to be announced next Tuesday.  In the short term my message to people in Limerick is that more beds are coming.  One can see in looking out the window that they are under construction.  Also, there are 68 more staff members working in the hospital than there were five weeks ago.  In the immediate term I want to see what we can do to improve social care services to help to decongest the hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#K00500","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":52,"content":"<p>It is interesting that the Minister is only now looking at that issue.

There is a primary care centre in Balbriggan and while I keep asking the Minister if it will get additional staff, he keeps telling me it will not and nor is there a plan to put in additional equipment.  If built, these primary care centres are not being adequately staffed. Similar to other points that have been made here, I can point the Minister to people in my constituency who have been waiting 36 months for therapeutic interventions for their kids.  They have been told they must wait a year before their kids can get onto lists and so on.  We are aware that the lists are lengthening.<\/p><p> If one considers a primary care centre that may just have a general practice doctor in it but no additional facilities - especially in an area such as Balbriggan where the population is growing - apart from the buildings, does the HSE have a workforce plan?  Mr. Reid will be more than familiar with this issue.  Can the Minister share such a plan with us and point us in the direction of X number of staff?  They are not coming to Balbriggan because while I do not know how many times I have asked this through parliamentary questions, the answer always is that services will be provided from within existing resources.  This means there will be no additional staff, despite the growing population.  Is there a workforce plan for all of these new primary care centres that are being built or are under construction?  Does that plan mirror Sl&aacute;intecare and will it provide therapies within the community?  Thus far, it has not.

When one is the Minister, one cannot find a more senior official in the Department to appoint than the Secretary General.  One can be a committed feminist and be a man.  It is very important.

I can see no reason I would not publish it.  I would like to publish it and I would like to brief party spokespeople on it.

I will have a quick-fire round now with some priority questions as they will take a bit of time, and I will ask more in the second or third time I come in, or both.  My initial questions, just to prepare the Minister's officials, relate to the children's hospital and to what is going on in the mid-west, which the Minister has touched on.  My other question relates to gynaecological services in Letterkenny.  If I have time I will also ask about CervicalCheck.  As I have said, I will have other questions later.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the minutes of the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, and the children's hospital programme and project steering group over the last months of this year.  I have a copy of the minutes and their sub-committee minutes here and I have gone through them.  Will the Minister supply this committee with all minutes of the boards and sub-commitees to the Chairman within a week?  I presume the Minister will do this and I would appreciate that.  This is the first request.<\/p> <p>  The NPHDB minutes of 3 April state that the finance and construction committee received a report wherein it was reported that additional monetary risk had been identified on provisional funds.  It also stated that this was going to affect the timelines for the hospital.  I am aware that Mr. Reid has written to the board members looking for this revised timetable.  Perhaps Mr. Reid will send on this letter to the committee, and the response, if he has it.  On 29 April, on the procurement sub-committee meeting, the minutes express concerns around the costs as they are appearing.<\/p><p>I have spoken to people and we all know there are further issues concerning this hospital.  At this point at the beginning of October what is the status of the timelines for the delivery of the overall project?  Has the Minister been informed of any issues regarding the timelines and, if so, when and by whom?  I direct the same question to Mr. Reid.  <\/p><p> At what scale are the costs escalating?  I remember once being accused by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il Chamber of exaggerating in that respect.  The figure I mentioned at this committee has been superseded and increased on and the Taoiseach admitted in effect admitted that since.  What scale of an increase are we talking about or is the Minister aware of?  <\/p><p> I ask Mr. Reid, in particular, to advise what concerns he has relating to the costs and timelines in accordance with the reason he wrote that letter?

My answer is \"yes\" in  terms of access to all the documentation and minutes.  It is important we continue to engage transparently with these committees and we will certainly make them available.  On 12 June when Fred Barry came before this committee, he pointed out, as did the PwC report and as we all know, that outside the GNP process other issues that can arise, including contractors submitting claims.  I am aware, although not of the scale of it, that extra claims have been submitted.  I believe this committee has been made aware of that previously also.  However, an extra claim does not necessarily result in that claim being paid.  The Deputy will remember when he and I were discussing this a number of months ago that a number of claims submitted ended up crystallising into a much smaller amount than was claimed for.  Obviously a project of this scale and complexity, the largest construction project ever in our health sector and one of the largest public sector construction projects in Europe, will have claims submitted as the project goes on.  It is important the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board can continue to deal with that in a commercially sensitive way.  I have no information of a rise in costs other than the fact that claims are being submitted, dealt with and managed, and that is the normal flow of this project.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#N00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":78,"content":"<p>The Minister has no concerns about rising costs yet or about the projected timeline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#N00300","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":79,"content":"<p>Before dealing with the timeline, I will finish dealing with the costs because I do not want to conflate the two.

I have no further information to add to that at this point.<\/p> <p>  On the timeline, as the HSE said when this query was first submitted, with a project of this scale some parts of it can run ahead of schedule and some parts of it can run behind schedule.  Overall, I have been informed that the project is still scheduled to be completed in 2022 and opened to the children of Ireland in 2023 on time.  I visited the hospital, as I know the Chairman did, and huge progress is being made on it.  The Connolly part of this is open.  I know this is an issue of intense political scrutiny, and it should be as it involves a great deal of money.  The hospital will have a massive health benefit.  The progress being made on this project is phenomenal.

I have also raised concerns about the disproportionate recruitment of staff, with a 24% increase in managerial and administrative staff versus an increase of as low as 3.6% in hospital staff.<\/p> <p>  On the consultants issue, the Minister referenced an invitation to a meeting to the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, to discuss, among other things, the two-tier contracts in regard to consultants.  Will the Minister clarify what process will be engaged in with the Irish Hospitals Consultants Association, IHCA, which feels excluded?  It was indicated a number of months ago that there would be engagement with it, but it has not yet occurred.  In the last number of weeks in particular it is at sea with regard to what is happening.  At what stage will engagement take place with the IHCA in regard to the process and how it will be involved in this area?<\/p><p>An additional 500 consultants were recruited over the past five years, but a number of consultant posts are currently occupied by locum or agency consultants at huge cost.  We can only fast-track a reduction in this cost by putting in place a better structure of employment.  It is extremely important this is done.  Before I continue, will the Minister clarify when it is proposed to engage with the IHCA, which represents the majority of consultants across the country?  Five years ago, it represented 2,500 consultants but it currently represents approximately 3,000.  When will the engagement with the IHCA take place?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#P01000","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":118,"content":"<p>I appreciate Senator Burke's ongoing interest in this area.  As I said earlier, I accept that there are serious recruitment and retention issues in the health service, which are particularly acute when it comes to the issue of consultants.  That is not just my view.  We specifically asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to examine the issue and it acknowledged that there were recruitment and retention issues in regard to consultants.  I want to build on the commission's findings and have an engagement with consultants on how we can rectify those recruitment and retention issues.  I genuinely believe that pay parity is an issue but I do not believe it is the only issue.  We need to examine Dr. Donal De Buitl&eacute;ir's report, and the OECD which I commissioned and published on the same day as I published the De Buitl&eacute;ir report, in regard to what other countries do regarding work practice as well.  <\/p> <p>  Next week, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE will commence engagement with the IMO.  We are commencing the engagement with the IMO because it is a member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and it is a party to the public sector pay agreements.  On the question regarding whether I want to see those talks broadened out after initial engagement, yes I do, but it is a matter for discussion with the IMO as well.<\/p> <p>  The IHCA has submitted more than 100 claims with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, on the issue of new entry consultants.  I would much rather that we worked out a way forward in relation to this matter through direct engagement but I will not tear up the rule book in regard to normal industrial relations.  Senator Burke mentioned engagement.  I was not in a position to attend the IHCA conference for an important personal and private reason.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, made himself available to attend that conference and was told that he would not be given a speaking slot, until the morning of the conference where they reversed the decision.  We are more than willing to engage with consultants but we have to engage in the context of a brave and ambitious reform agenda through which we can deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  Those who put together the Sl&aacute;intecare report asked me to put in place a Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, which I did.  For the first time ever, we have a cross-party approach to healthcare reform in our country.  I am very proud of the plan which a minority Government produced with the Opposition.  That plan also states that we have to change working patterns.  I was also asked to commission the De Buitl&eacute;ir report.  To see it immediately dismissed by representative bodies is very disappointing.  They should be open to engaging on the substance of it.  <\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Burke's question, we will engage with consultants, commencing with the IMO.  I do want to see the engagement broadened out to other consultant organisations as well.  I want to resolve this issue.  I am already on record in regard to, in my view, the unfairness around pay parity.  We have to engage in the context of the available resources, a no-deal Brexit and a reform agenda.  The resolution is not just pay.  Pay is an element but so too is reform and access to theatres for young consultants.  It is also about how we can engage our consultants in our primary care network and primary care teams and about how the new advanced nurse practitioners can take some of the workload in terms of care off some of our doctors.  I am excited that we are going to finally engage.  I would have liked this engagement to happen much earlier but I am pleased to now have agreement with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other places to commence it.  I think we can start a conversation about an exciting journey of reform that will help with recruitment and retention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#Q00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":119,"content":"<p>The IHCA, which represents the majority of consultants, believes it has been sidelined.

I seek clarification but am not attempting to have a swipe at the Minister or his officials.

At the beginning of every year I am always told that the budget is adequate and at the end of the year we find that it is not and there are reasons for that.  Every Department is asked at budget time to make projections for the year ahead and within each Department there are components which make a contribution but something is going wrong all of the time.  There is some shortfall that is not being addressed.  This is not a criticism of anybody at all and I am not making any political point here.

Deputy Durkan is right to raise the issue of the health budget.  There is a number of parts to the answer.  First, we must be honest about the fact that the Oireachtas makes decisions outside of budget time.  The Oireachtas rightly decided this year that we needed to sort the nurses' industrial relations dispute which was not budgeted for.  We decided, through the various industrial relations mechanisms, that we needed to solve the SIPTU dispute.  We also decided that we needed to do more on Brexit and more in relation to Cervical Check.  Deputy Durkan, as a long-serving Member of this House, knows that budget day is a moment in time, albeit an important one, but in a dynamic environment like healthcare, decisions can be made after the budget which can have a significant impact.  We will see evidence of that this year as well.  I am interested to hear Mr. Reid's views on this.  There is an issue around making sure that we have better data and information in health to prepare us to engage in the budgetary process.  I must say, honestly, with the arrival of the new CEO and the new board structure, the financial information and data coming from the HSE in the context of that process is like night and day, so dramatic is the improvement.<\/p><p>I am pleased to say that when the Supplementary Estimate figure for health becomes clear in the coming days, it will be a very significant reduction on what was required last year because of very intense financial oversight by the CEO, the board and HSE managers and staff across the country and I thank them for their work in that regard.  The final point is that if we are talking about better outcomes and better value for the taxpayer's investment, then we must focus on the reorientation of the health service.  We must do more in the community and we must deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  I know that Deputy Durkan is a passionate supporter of the latter.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#S01100","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569970800,"counter":147,"content":"<p>In terms of delivering against budget at the start of the year versus the end of the year, there are three forces that managers in the HSE and I must manage.  The first is obviously improving the services that we are delivering, which Deputies are quite rightly challenging us on in terms of where we are today; the second is providing a safe environment for all users of our services; and the third is doing all of that within the budget allocation that we have been given by the Oireachtas and Government.  They can be competing forces on a daily basis but we must make judgments throughout the year to keep those forces in balance together.  How are we doing that?  If one takes my opening statement on where we are this year in comparison to last year, one can seen a strengthened financial performance which I put down to a few factors.  We are now operating at a level where each hospital group CEO and each community officer attends a monthly meeting with the chief operations officer and the national director.  We go through slides, hospital by hospital, group by group, CHO by CHO, on service performance and financial performance.  They all have allocated budgets, month on month, to report back against.  That may sound like basic financial governance but it is really important and it is having an impact.  We have hospital group managers owning their budgets and CHO group managers owning theirs.  They are committing to actions for the following month and next Tuesday we will go through the whole process again.  The basic discipline of strengthening our financial management processes across the organisation is proving beneficial.  I can demonstrate that by pointing members to the current position on our budget this year compared to the same time last year.  Apart from the fact of being down on the same position last year in terms of the overrun, the mix is also important.  <\/p> <p>  If one looks at the &euro;16 billion budget that the HSE was allocated for the delivery of services, &euro;12 billion of that is for operational services, where we can hold individual managers, hospitals and CHOs to account.  On that funding, we have challenged the CHOs and everyone else not to go above &euro;100 million, which is accounted for by our acute and disability pressures.  The other &euro;4 billion of the &euro;16 billion budget relates to pensions and demand-led services.  We can get our arms around some aspects of that, like drugs reimbursement by using more biosimilar products, for example.  We are now challenging every clinician in this area and we now have data telling us which consultants in what hospitals and hospital groups are using biosimilars.  This is a much more cost-effective use of our drugs budget.  We have put a gain-sharing agreement in place with some hospitals and clinicians, whereby they are rewarded for the use of biosimilar products which makes a significant saving for us.  We can do a lot in some areas.  In summary, if one looks at our budget for this year, the largest part of the &euro;281 million overrun, at 53%, is in the demand-led areas where we are under pressure.  In fairness to the operations systems, they have a stronger control over and grip on the finances.<\/p> <p>  Regarding data, Members will be well familiar with the lack of a robust financial management data system across the health service.  There are remnants of the various health boards and the different systems that were in place in various areas.  I will not go back over the past but at the next board meeting on 18 October we will discuss and seek approval for an investment plan for a new integrated financial management system.<\/p><p>This system will be integrated across hospitals, including acute hospitals, community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and our section 38 organisations.  One of the pressures we have to deal with as part of this process is the management of finances within section 38 hospitals.  In summary, we will have improved financial controls and management processes, we are investing in a new financial management system, we will have greater clarity on what individual hospital groups and CHOs can control and will be able to hold them to account for those matters, and we will have to balance service pressures with patient safety pressures to mitigate risks, an issue which many members have raised.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":149,"content":"<p>I accept that there are some improvements, but it is not good for morale in the hospital system or the health system, or for the morale of officials in the Department or anyone else involved, for us to be seen falling short of the target for one reason or another, or to do so again for a different reason in a subsequent year.  That does not wash with the public or staff.  It frustrates the staff.  I am not being negative about it but, as a former Opposition spokesman on health, I would have thought that, when the Estimates are being drawn up at the beginning of the year, various known unknowns or unknown unknowns, as a certain president used to say, would be brought into play and their likely impact over the course of the year calculated.  I would have thought a prime cost, PC, sum would be included for issues of which the health service was not yet aware to ensure and safeguard the veracity of the Estimate.  The veracity of the Estimate at the beginning of the year is crucial.

With regard to speech and language therapy, I am pleased that in this year's budget, we provided funding for 100 additional therapy posts across the country.  That was a big ask of the Minister, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Deputy Murphy-O'Mahony also highlighted the need for these 100 additional posts, which I acknowledge.  I am informed by the HSE that it expects all of those posts to be filled by the end of the year.  That will be one of the most significant increases in many years.  As I said in discussion with Deputy Donnelly earlier, I do not believe that this, in itself, is enough.  We are going to need to build on it in the future and we also need to look at how we deliver the model of care.  The pilot speech and language therapy programme in schools is an exciting model.  This has been done in the UK for a number of years and it has resulted in significant progress in respect of waiting times.  That is the role I would like this programme to fulfil.<\/p> <p>  With regard to scoliosis, I can provide the Deputy and the committee with an update in writing on our progress.  Responsibility lies with the children's hospital group, Children's Health Ireland.  There has been extraordinary focus on this area.  Additional staff have been provided and there was a significant increase in the number of operations performed last year compared to the previous year.<\/p><p>I need to be honest; we have a number of complex cases in which a number of different medical issues above and beyond scoliosis are at play.  In 2016 we carried out 224 procedures in this area, whereas last year we carried out 418, so I am satisfied that there is a massive focus on this area.  Of course, we need to continue improving.  Perhaps Mr. Reid would like to add to that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#U00500","speaker":"1251","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569970800,"counter":154,"content":"<p>I will quote the same figures and there are further figures that I can supply.

I am with the Deputy in respect of staff morale.  One of the priorities on which I have led personally since joining the HSE is, with my leadership team, to work and engage with staff to improve staff morale.  It is not always a matter of finance; it is also about the pressures staff are under every day.  We need to give them support and confidence.<\/p> <p>  There are arrangements in place with regard to maternity cover.  As the Deputy knows, we arrange agency cover, which comes at a significant cost to us.  A large proportion of our agency spend goes on maternity cover.  Approximately 35% of workers in the HSE are on various types of reduced hours or reduced working arrangements.  This is largely because the greater proportion of our staff are women.  We should support that and I encourage such support but it does result in a demand for agency support.

I will start with a number of questions about the hospital consultant issue, even though many others have also contributed on it.  <\/p> <p>  My concern is that ten years on from the recession, we are not making inroads in recruitment.  Sl&aacute;intecare, on which many members of the committee worked a number of years ago, is a roadmap for a period of ten years, but it will not be doable if we do not have the necessary front-line staff.  For example, Beaumont Hospital recently lost three dermatologists to the private sector.  It now has only one whole-time equivalent in dermatology and 400 patients have been referred for dermatological treatments in the private sector or elsewhere.  Here we are again, with consultants being poached by the private sector.  In the Bons Secours Hospital in Cork the last 12 appointments have been made from Cork University Hospital.  There is a huge amount of leeching.  An emergency department consultant left Tallaght Hospital recently to enter the private sector.  I understand the argument about the market and consultants, but when one looks at the sub-specialties where there is very little private work such as emergency medicine, psychiatry and paediatric radiology, these are areas in which we have some of the most acute recruitment problems.  We continue to recruit administrative staff, as Senator Colm Burke pointed out, but we are losing front-line staff such as nurses, consultants and the people we need to do the work on the front line.  I know from talking to hospital consultants that they are very disheartened.  <\/p> <p>  Reference has been made to the IMO letter, but we must consider the issue of false economies and locum staff.  A locum anaesthetist in Bantry was paid &euro;415,000 to do a job last year which is far in excess of the salary of a permanent consultant.  Tet locum consultant had no role in education, training or any of the other work in which permanent consultants engaged.  To my mind, the total cost to the health service is almost &euro;600,000, which is not sustainable.  There are 108 consultants who are not on the specialist register, SpR.  As members know, they are concentrated in regional hospitals, which is a huge risk.  While I did consider naming the hospitals in question, I decided that it would not be fair to the representatives who are here.  There is a figure of &euro;3 billion in State Claims Agency costs, 90% of which comprises health claims.  We are training the most doctors, exporting the most and then poaching them from developing countries which is in breach of WHO guidelines.  Despite plans, including implementation plans, and so forth, I am very concerned that we will end up in a situation where we will not have the expertise required.  There was an acceptance a number of years ago that the country was on its knees and that we would have to put our shoulders to the wheel.<\/p><p>Many consultants are running out of patience.  I am concerned that we are dumbing down our health service and dumbing down quality.  It may get to the point of no return and we may never be able to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.  Perhaps the Minister or an official can tell me how many consultant posts around the country are unfilled.  What is being spent on locums and temporary staff?  <\/p><p> Another massive issue is the annually increasing spend on the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  This obviously has its benefits in that people get treated, but it is not a sustainable model of care for treating patients in the system.  It was always expected to be a sticking plaster for areas in which there were capacity issues rather than an attempt to stop a haemorrhage.  It was not supposed to export our patients.  <\/p><p> The consultants claim that &euro;20 million per year will attract consultants home.  They claim they will not work on the same corridor as someone who earns more than them for doing the same job.  It seems very reasonable.  I agree with the Minister that it is about far more than pay, but it must start with pay parity.  Something has to be done and some way forward has to be found.  These people are not just doctors, they are the people who are running the system and who have corporate knowledge of the Irish system.  If we lose the goodwill of the consultants, we will never be able to implement Sl&aacute;intecare.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#Y00600","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":195,"content":"<p>On her point about the WHO, I assure Deputy O'Connell that we take our obligations very seriously.

I would like to put some figures on the record of this committee, because I believe they are important.  I accept there is a challenge in respect of recruitment and retention and that pay parity needs to be addressed.  I have said that, I believe it, and I do not disagree with Deputy O'Connell in that regard.  There is the whole-time equivalent of 3,153 consultants in the Irish public health service.  More than 600 additional consultants have been recruited over the past five years and 139 additional consultants have begun working in the health service over the last 12 months.  While I accept there is a challenge in respect of recruitment and retention, people are sometimes of the opinion that there are now fewer doctors and that we are losing doctors.  The statistics do not show that.  More than 600 additional doctors have entered the health service over the past five years, including 139 over the past 12 months.  That does not take away from the point Deputy O'Connell makes about the very significant issues in recruitment and retention.  The CEO will speak to vacancy levels and so on in a moment.<\/p> <p>  I am deadly serious about sitting down with consultant representative bodies to do two things.  I want to address the immediate challenges with regard to recruitment and retention, of which I accept pay is an element.  I also want to build on the Public Sector Pay Commission's findings.  The Deputy should remember that we, as a Government, saw this as such an issue that we asked the Public Sector Pay Commission to carry out a body a work on it.  The commission told us to sit down and engage and I want to do that.  <\/p> <p>  I will need the help of the consultants to do the second thing I want to do.  Deputy O'Connell talked about the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, into which she has put a lot of work and a lot of her personal time.  It is disappointing that, every time we move forward with an element of Sl&aacute;intecare, I hear from the representative bodies that they do not agree with it.  The speed at which the de Buitl&eacute;ir report was dismissed by representative bodies is very disappointing.  The Deputy talked about international comparisons.  The OECD report I commissioned, which we also published that day, shows that Ireland is out of sync with other countries in respect of private practice in public hospitals.  Phase 1 - and it will have to be phase 1 because sequencing is important - will have to be talking about the immediate recruitment and retention challenges, of which pay parity is an element.  That needs to be done before we can talk about reform.  We will start that process with the INMO next week.  I want to expand those talks to include other bodies such as the Irish Hospital Consultants Association in due course.<\/p> <p>  We will then need to move to phase 2, which will have to be about the Sl&aacute;intecare reform agenda.  I accept that one cannot be done without the other.  We have very hard-working doctors working under a lot of pressure and they need to realise that the political system and I want to support them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#Z00400","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569970800,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I may call on the chief accounting officer when I am finished.

It is also an issue of recruitment and, equally, of retention.  People are having different experiences when they go elsewhere.  Having said that, the second point I want to make is that I have spent a lot of time with the chief clinical officer in direct engagement with consultants across the acute system.  I agree that we need their goodwill and that we need to hear their voices and the issues they are raising with regard to service delivery.<\/p><p>There is fairly regular direct engagement between clinical directors and consultants across the system.<\/p><p> There are significant vacancies throughout the country.

They are targeting our children.  It is clear what they are doing.  Large cigarette companies, which know the war on tobacco is under way and that we are heading towards a tobacco-free Ireland, are mooching into a new area.  I was in a petrol station a few nights ago.  Some time ago, the Oireachtas decided to bring in plain packaging and block the advertising of cigarettes.  However, when I looked behind the counter in the station, I noticed that all of that advertising has been replaced by advertising for e-cigarettes.  I am appalled at the number of Oireachtas Members who ask me to meet representatives of vaping companies.<\/p><p>I will never meet them, so Members - I am not referring to anyone in this room - can stop asking me to do so.  This is a new arm of the tobacco industry, it is a threat to our children's health, and we need to call it out.  What are we going to do about it?  We will first ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children, people under the age of 18.  We will bring draft legislation to Cabinet this month, I think, to do that.  We in the Houses of the Oireachtas have a really good record of taking public health decisions on a cross-party basis, and I look forward to working with the committee in that regard.<\/p><p> Beyond the sale of e-cigarettes to children and the benefits or otherwise of vaping as a cessation tool, it is fair to say the evidence is evolving at a very rapid pace.  HIQA did an assessment of this in 2017.  I have now asked the Health Research Board, HRB, to look at the potential harmful impacts of e-cigarettes, vaping or whatever one wishes to call it.  Its response is due next March.  Step one, then, is to ban the sale of e-cigarettes to children.  Step two is to look at the HRB evidence in March and see what further action we need to take.  My instinct, not as a doctor but as someone who talks to doctors, is that there may be - may be - an understandable logic to a person already on tobacco moving to e-cigarettes.  However, that is very different from targeting 14, 15 and 16 year old kids with nice, colourful things and children's flavoured e-cigarettes and advertising them to try to get around our rules on plain packaging.

We have a very serious problem in University Hospital Limerick.  The problems facing hospitals in general are capacity, consultant numbers and diagnostics.  One of the critical points in Limerick is the lack of a second MRI scanner.  I know that Mr. Reid mentioned the HSE is considering whether to buy or lease a scanner, but the absolute urgency of a second MRI scanner in Limerick cannot be stated strongly enough.  Many people in hospital are waiting unnecessarily for MRI scans to determine whether they are admitted or discharged or to make proper diagnoses so they can have proper management plans.  I refer in particular to neurological conditions but also cancer.  Unless Limerick is supplied with a second MRI scanner, the problems we see there every day, 70 or 80 people waiting on trolleys, will remain.  Trolleys are just a manifestation of what is happening within the hospital itself.  Casualty is not the problem; the problem is what is happening in the house of the hospital.  There must be a second MRI scanner in Limerick immediately.

The NTPF has worked with us in this regard, which has been helpful, over last winter and in this part of the year.  The underlying point, that Limerick requires a second MRI scanner, is agreed, and we are looking at options including, as the Minister said, winter funding.  I think the quickest option is to acquire a leased MRI scanner.  The timescales around acquisition and building would be longer.  We will therefore look at the option of putting a leased MRI scanner on site as part of our winter programme.  The implication for us is a cost that I think has been referenced at approximately &euro;1 million to &euro;1.4 million, but a second scanner is a key requirement that is fully accepted, so we are working with the group on what that would look like on the ground.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#BB00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Woods"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":212,"content":"<p>What is the timeline, then, for the provision of the scanner?

The second point I wish to make concerns the trolley problem.  In the month of September the number of people on trolleys was 40% higher than in the same month last year, so whatever reforms are happening or whatever the Minister is doing is quite patently not working.  I will give him some examples.  Moving away from trolleys, there are patients suffering greatly because of bed capacity problems, not necessarily just because they are on trolleys.  There are patients for whom we as GPs must fight to get them into the system.  It is not just a matter of asking for a consultation; it is actually a fight to get people into the system.  There are patients in the midwest who have cancer and who have been waiting six months for a basic diagnostic procedure.  A number are cancelled or time out.  I was in contact with one patient this morning, an elderly gentleman who has been waiting for surgery for a number of weeks.  He was admitted on Sunday night and fasted all day Monday and all day Tuesday, and today is Wednesday and he still has not had his surgery.<\/p> <p>  The Minister cannot just dismiss these issues by saying the numbers are improving.  There are real stories behind each one of these patients.  I do not think he recognises the urgency of that.  I just did not get a sense of urgency this morning from the opening statements he and Mr. Reid made.  I just want the Minister to respond.  How urgently will he address the bed capacity issue and the consultant capacity issue?  I understand from what he said today that he has now written a letter to the IMO.  He committed to doing that before the summer recess.  He did it on the last day of September.  He has not contacted the Irish Hospital Consultants Association.  The recruitment and retention of consultants is a huge barrier because it can be proven that if a consultant or two are added to a team, that waiting list drops immediately.  Addressing recruitment and retention is therefore the key to reducing the number of people on waiting lists and trolleys.

Nobody has a monopoly of concern or compassion for them.  In the Chairman's region, when he and others approached me and said they could not wait for the capital plan and that something had to be done about bed capacity in Limerick, we went ahead together and found the funding in advance of the capital plan to proceed with the 60-bed modular unit.  Unlike previous Governments, which during boom times decided there were too many hospital beds in the country - that gets airbrushed from history now - and shut them down, my record is that in every single year I have been Minister there have been more beds in the Irish health service.<\/p> <p>  Looking at recruitment and retention truthfully, we had a major issue with GPs, a major issue with our nurses and midwives and a major issue with our consultants - and others, but I will take just those three significant groups.  We have worked our way through the GP process.  We have more to do, but the GP community itself has endorsed by 95% the arrangement we reached.  I know that the Chairman, while acknowledging there needs to be a new contract, has welcomed the progress in that regard.  With the nurses and midwives we have come up with an agreement that will see more money put into nurses' pockets, which was ratified by 66% of nurses and midwives.  My next big body of work on recruitment and retention in the health service concerns consultants.  As Minister for Health, however, I find that on some days I come into the Houses of the Oireachtas and everybody wants to get very irate about the overspend on health while, on other days, I come in and before 11.30 a.m. we have probably racked up a bill of &euro;500 million or more.  There are competing demands in the health service.  That is why we must reform it.  I know that that is why the Chairman is passionate about it, but so am I.<\/p><p>I am absolutely passionate about reform in the health service.  We would like to do it a million times more quickly, but we have taken major decisions in the past six months alone such as on the agreement with GPs, the breaking up of the HSE into new structures and engagement with consultants.  We are genuinely putting the building blocks in place.  As Minister, I will, rightly, be held to account on day-to-day issues, but I am satisfied that the things to which I have referred are the blocks that will build a better health service.  A compelling case has been made by members today, as well as by colleagues from the mid-west, as to why we need to move on the question of MRIs.

If it goes over budget, it is because it is delivering more services to deal with the unmet need that has built up.  If we are to meet our target and come in under budget, there has to be reform of the system because it is inefficient.  Senator Colm Burke referred to the number of non-front-line staff employed every year.  It must take a huge number of non-front-line staff to run an inefficient service.

The HSE and the excellent people who work in it know that its current structure is not configured correctly.  It is a thorny issue to tell people that they have to change the way they work.  Today a consultant is allowed to engage in private practice in a hospital in Limerick, while there are 80 patients on trolleys in the same hospital.  There will be a moment when people will have to nail their colours to the mast and I cannot wait until we get to that moment.  Are people in favour of Sl&aacute;intecare and what it actually means, or they in favour of it as though it was a Rose of Tralee-type concept?  I am in favour of the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, which will mean big and significant changes.  It will mean paying consultants more and tackling issues such as pay parity.  It will mean greater bed capacity, but it will also mean no more business as usual.  It will mean fewer managers in the health service and ultimately lead to a voluntary redundancy scheme as we streamline management.  Where there are two finance functions today, one for community services and one for hospitals, there will have to be one.  Front-line staff who are brilliant and do an excellent job will have to look at different ways of working and we will have to remunerate and support them accordingly.

The top three floors will house 72 acute beds run by hospital management, with the bottom two floors being a new, state-of-the-art palliative care facility.  Local Oireachtas Members, including some of the Minister's colleagues and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, got a tour of the facility last week.  Palliative care will be run by the CHO but the problem is that only &euro;300,000 has been allocated as a start for staffing and revenue funding.  People in the south east are scandalised by the fact that the building is built, fully equipped and ready to be opened but has not yet received the revenue funding.  We have met with officials who have told us that even when they get the funding they will have to recruit staff and we could be talking about a year or more before the unit becomes operational.  How much will it cost to fully staff the palliative care unit?  Why was the funding not given much earlier, given that we knew this was going to be completed and fully equipped in the summer of this year?  It could be lying idle for months or a year but patients in the south east deserve the same palliative care options as people in other parts of the country.<\/p> <p>  In responses to parliamentary questions, the Minister said there would be an allocation arising from the overall funding for palliative care in the Estimates.

There is incredible community support for this and it will be the first inpatient and day service specialist care unit for the south east and will also cover Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary and Wexford.

I understand also that planning and design in respect of the 96-bed acute block is under way.  Following this historical reconfiguration there will be more than 150 additional beds but until such time as the 60-bed block is in place, we need a radical plan to deal with overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick.  Today, there are 47 people awaiting discharge.  The figure for this time last year was eight.  Owing to the lack of beds in Limerick, the focus must be on discharges.  Can the Minister give a commitment in regard to the transitional funding under the fair deal scheme?  <\/p><p> The Minister referenced the MRI scanner.  The existing scanner is at breaking point.  If it were to break down, would it take six or eight weeks to replace it?  The situation has reached crisis point.  An MRI scanner needs to be provided with immediate effect.  Six or eight weeks is too long for the people on the ground.

There are other issues that need to be addressed, including recruitment of an MS nurse, for which I have been fighting for a year.  I have been told that funding is in place, that the position has been advertised but the recruitment has not progressed as it there must be a sign-off at a national level from on high, which ties in with the situation nationally in terms of recruitment.

We first need to do the infrastructural upgrade of that hospital in terms of fire safety and so on.  The Senator will be aware that those projects are proceeding.<\/p> <p>  On the scanner, we have had a useful conversation this morning on the benefits of an additional scanner to the mid-west region in terms of trolley numbers.

On the MS nurse, while I am not familiar with the specifics, I am aware that the Senator has been championing that recruitment for some time.  An additional 68 staff were hired in the hospital in the last five weeks, more than 40 of whom are in the area of nursing.

This funding is, largely, funding directed by the Department and the HSE in terms of current expenditure, to try to address, pre the winter plan, some of the issues in terms of transitional care beds and to relieve pressure under the community support scheme, the nursing home support scheme and in respect of home help provision.  There has been some improvement in the last few weeks in terms of delayed discharges, which we would expect, in turn, to impact on trolley numbers.<\/p> <p>  I want to assure members that in terms of delivery all of these matters are urgent and a matter of priority everyday for our managers.  In terms of trolley count, including in the mid-west, over a three week period in September there was an increase of approximately 6.5% in people into our emergency departments, which is very significant.  I visited University Hospital Limerick and many of the acute hospitals throughout the country.  What we are seeing, particularly in the past few weeks, is an additional requirement for older persons coming through our emergency departments.  As members will be aware, in our acute settings the rate of admission generally is one in four or 25%.  In the case of older persons, it is one in two.  As I said, we are seeing a significant surge of older persons into emergency departments and, thus, a significant increase in terms of admissions.  The additional investment made ahead of the winter plan will have some benefit over the next few weeks as well as it starts to work back through the system.<\/p> <p>  On recruitment, in the period from July 2018 to July 2019 we recruited 2,895 staff.  Since the start of January this year, 1,138 staff were recruited into the health system.  The latter is a mix of nursing, midwifery, consultants, management and administrative staff.  On management and administrative staff recruitment, which I have examined in detail, 85% of these staff are front-line support staff.  We do have an issue and we will be reviewing the centre of the HSE in terms of management overhead.  However, I would like to reassure members that much of the recruitment is primarily targeted towards front-line services.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#GG00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Reid"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":245,"content":"<p>My understanding is that the MS post requires sign-off by the national director of recruitment.

I have been very honest with Les Martin, Senator Norris and others.  My gut feeling is that we should expand our newborn screening programme because when one looks at European and international norms, as my Department has done, one can see that some countries screen for fewer diseases than we do but many countries screen for far more.  It is fair to say that Italy probably screens for more diseases than nearly any other country but from memory, we are behind the European average in terms of what we screen for.  I think we should screen for more diseases.<\/p> <p>  However, I have told Les Martin and others and will continue to say that these are clinical decisions as well.

This time last year, the Government made a commitment to hire an additional 114 assistant psychologists, which it more or less followed through with.  My understanding is that 300 people turned up for those interviews so we have roughly 186 extra people looking for a job and we talk about recruitment and retention.  According to information I received, some of those who were appointed to these 114 posts have already left their posts without carrying out any proper assessments or whatever responsibilities they had in their positions.<\/p><p>One individual spent their last week sending out 300 cancellations of appointments.  I wanted to raise this issue at this forum because, as we are all aware, Ministers do not know absolutely everything that is going on.  I wanted to flag the issue and I wanted Mr. Reid to know how difficult it is on both sides, because I am a realist.  The issue is that somebody within management is not giving the proper information to the relevant Ministers.  They are not cracking the whip, considering that there is a duty of care and responsibility with 114 new assistant psychiatrists.  Many of them are not allowed to carry out any work.  How many of them have left without doing anything?  If one person can send out 300 cancellations in a week, is there any possibility we can find out the truth?  Surely somebody in management with responsibility should be held accountable for that.

The Chairman suggested that he felt no sense of urgency from the Minister.  I am not saying the Minister does not care.  We all care.  However, I do not get a sense of urgency from the healthcare system or the political leadership, which is the Minister.  I reiterate that I have read back through all the opening statements and there is no mention of the crisis in access.  We have the worst access that we have ever had in Ireland.  We have the worst access for patients through the public system of anywhere in Europe.  The Minister said he is deadly serious about wanting to sit down with consultant representative bodies, but then he cites what I think are unintentionally spurious reasons for meeting the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, first and not the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA.  The IHCA is fully compliant with industrial relations criteria to represent consultants, as of course is the IMO.  We have seen no movement on pay inequality in recent years, even though we know we have the lowest level of hospital consultants anywhere in Europe.  We know this is a major contributor to the inhuman waiting lists, yet there has been no movement in what is a pretty small number to reverse that.  The Minister is still going ahead with building private facilities into the national children's hospital and the national maternity hospital in spite of the de Buitl&eacute;ir report, while stating that he supports that report.<\/p> <p>  I am not going to dwell on the attacks on Fianna F&aacute;il, but just to correct the record, because I know the Minister is keen on the record being straight, he seems to be suggesting that the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government took a load of beds out of the system, and for some bizarre reason he is increasingly referencing Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, presumably as some pre-election warm-up.  Between 2000 and 2004, Deputy Martin was Minister for Health and he added more than 1,000 beds.  In respect of the 14 years of the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government, the number of beds when it left Government was 1,000 more than when it came in.<\/p> <p>  The reality is that while I accept that the Minister cares, as we all care, the question is around prioritisation.  I do not see it and I do not feel the urgency.  The total health expenditure voted through this House over the past three years under Deputy Harris as Minister is about an additional &euro;3.5 billion, and in spite of that, access to public healthcare has collapsed.  If this is indeed such a priority, how has access collapsed given such a massive increase in funding for healthcare?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#OO00200","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":335,"content":"<p>There are a number of questions there from Deputy Donnelly.  First, and I see him regularly making this point, I am not building private health facilities.  I am building rooms under the current rules that Fianna F&aacute;il was happy with in government, which allow those rooms to be used for private facilities.  The Deputy talks about the consultants a lot.  I would like him to go and talk to them about the use of those rooms because they would point out that they have a contractual right today to do private practice in public hospitals.  Unless the Deputy wants our doctors not to turn up at work, under their current contract they have a right to use those rooms.  I want to change those rooms.  I want them to be public rooms.  I do not want any private practice in public hospitals.  I would welcome Fianna F&aacute;il's position on that.  I see on the Fianna F&aacute;il website that it commits to the de Buitl&eacute;ir report on removing private practice from public hospitals.  The Deputy should say that.  It would be very helpful.  If Fianna F&aacute;il is in favour of removing private practice from public hospitals, we agree with this and we should get on and do it together.<\/p> <p>  On the beds argument, we will have this another day, probably in some television studio during some election, I hope in May 2020.  The number of day case beds might have risen but the number of inpatient beds fell at a time of economic growth in our country, and that is very regrettable.  I look forward to debating that point.<\/p> <p>  Access to the health service has not collapsed.  There is an absolutely serious issue with outpatients and a lot of the criticisms the Deputy makes regarding outpatients are valid.  I accept them.  We must do a hell of a lot better in relation to outpatients.  However, with inpatients it has dramatically improved.  The number of people waiting for hospital operations has improved.  Access to primary care, including the fact that we have expanded eligibility for free GP care, has improved.  I hope in the budget to expand access for more children to free GP care and to dental care.  That access is improving.  The fact that there are 100 more therapists means that access is improving.  If the criticism was of outpatients, I would take it and I should be held to account, but in general access has not collapsed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#OO00300","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":336,"content":"<p>Just to be clear, it is the conundrum of how, with &euro;3.5 billion in additional spending, there are more than a million people now on the waiting lists who were on them three, four, five or six years ago.

Two things have emerged from our conversations today.  I gave a commitment that the HSE would meet mid-west Oireachtas Members within a fortnight.  One is whether we can improve diagnostic access in the hospital.  There seems to be an acute issue in terms of accessing MRI facilities, which hospital management and representatives think could, if resolved, really help patient flow.

This is a quick-fire round.  I have tried to be non-political in this matter.  There is not enough urgency attached to the mid-west by the Minister and Mr. Reid in particular.  I am not going to tolerate what is going on there anymore.  I have to hold people to account to a level that has never been seen before.  It is going to happen.  I spent all morning dealing with cases in the hospital in Limerick.  Every time I walk out of the room, that is what I am dealing with.  A politician should not be doing that.  It is not that I do not want to do it.  I am sure the Chairman has to do the same.  It is not our role in life and it is not how the health service should function.<\/p> <p>  The 60-bed modular unit is a year behind.  I am not even going to go on about that.  That will not solve much.  It is not even possible to have infection control.  I encountered a case where the staff did not know what was wrong with a woman, yet they could not isolate her because they had not the capacity.  They ended up having to take her to a room in Nenagh.<\/p><p>Nenagh is not even ready for that.  There are so many issues here.  I put it to Mr. Reid that this needs an individual and complete piece of work.  It needs a complete, separate entity.  It is not Mr. Reid's fault; I have good time for Mr. Reid, which I have put onto the public record, and we have worked closely together.  I am not going to tolerate this any more, however.  I have been at this for 14 or 15 years but have never seen this before.  It is now October and can one imagine what it will be like in February?  What the HSE is trying to do relating to budgets is fine, but over the next years the whole thing needs to be recalibrated.  It is not currently being discriminated against, but the mid-west needs a &euro;40 million uplift on the current side, not just the capital side, in relation to everything I said earlier.  If it does not happen, then the mid-west will be discriminated against.  The HSE or the Department cannot say that I did not come up with short-term ideas for how to deal with this.  I have recycled these proposals over the last three or four years as the health spokesperson.  As for the MRI scanner, one can compare Limerick hospital with Beaumont Hospital to see how far behind Limerick is.  I have referred to the situation with doctors and nurses and have spoken on transitional packages.  I propose that Limerick hospital be turned into a seven-day hospital.  It would help if most things did not stop at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. on Friday.  The pathways towards the minor injury units in Nenagh and Ennis need to be extended.  I have been saying this for years, and the Minister will admit it. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#RR02000","speaker":"1349","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I do, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#SS00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":392,"content":"<p>It would help to take the pressure off what is going on there.<\/p> <p>  We need intermediate vehicles in order that people are not stuck inside for the weekends.  The current way of transitioning people out of the hospital and into step-down facilities is not working.  I am dealing with Maria Bridgeman and Colette Cowan all the time.  They are two fantastic people and I have no issue with the management and the staff down there.  They are working but they are working in an environment that is impossible.  I ask Mr. Reid to please take this on board.  He should trust me when I say that I will take this to another level.  If I have to live inside the hospital, I will do it as an Opposition spokesperson.<\/p> <p>  With regard to gynaecological services in Letterkenny, the Minister has had correspondence on and is aware of a number of issues in respect of a case in 2017, some of which has been in the media and some of it which has not.  There was another case in 2019 and a further case has been brought to my attention within the past 48 hours.  Will the Minister indicate if he is going to launch an investigation into what has been happening up there or not?  What has the Minister done with the information that has been provided to him over a number of years?  I am aware of a case of a woman who has issues and is waiting for her situation to be dealt with in St. James's Hospital as a result of being pushed down from what happened in Letterkenny, over to Derry and now down to St. James's.  This is on top of the two other cases of which the Minister is aware.  I ask the Minister to please tell me that he is going to do something on it.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of medical cards for patients with terminal cancer I thank the Minister for meeting Mr. John Wall, who is a brilliant guy as we both agree.  Mr. Wall was very happy to meet with the Minister, and fair play to the Minister.  I have no issue there.  The Minister, however, has a budget coming up in a week's time.  The provision of funding in this regard would be small money in that context and unless the Minister provides funding in the budget, with all the will in the world he will probably not be the Minister in one year's time.  He needs to provide for it in the budget.  This is a real decision.  It is small money.  The 24-month profile is probably the way to go.  It is an interim step.  It seems like a cruel thing to say but this is a way to deal with it.  I ask the Minister to put this into his budget.<\/p> <p>  The Minister has received a letter from Tony O'Reilly about his wife Julie O'Reilly.  Julie was the lady who died from endometrial cancer and she was one of the 221.  I will not get into the details here.  Mr. O'Reilly has asked for an investigation into how his wife's medical details ended up with a newspaper.  Mr. O'Reilly has written to the Minister about this.  Personally, I would like to know how this happened also.  It should not have happened.  I have a copy of Mr. O'Reilly letter to hand, which the Minister has acknowledged.  I ask that the Minister address this issue.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister clarify how many women have had their Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, results?  As it will be over by the end of the month, surely the Department knows by now what percentage of the total have those results.<\/p> <p>  I am deeply worried by Mr. Reid's opening statement with regard to section 38 and section 39 organisations.  This is not Mr. Reid's fault but it is his problem.  Some of these are about to fall over.<\/p><p>If those organisations fall over the State suffers, and the people suffer to a point.  This committee has been through this, as has the Committee of Public Accounts.  We need to put this on a different footing.  Somebody needs to stop this and turn it around.  A good few of these organisations are getting loans just to stay afloat.  This cannot continue.  What is going to be done about it?<\/p><p> I have two final issues, one of which is the recruitment freeze.  I have raised this question previously and we have all played games to the effect that there is no recruitment freeze, and others have also raised it.  In effect, there is a recruitment freeze.  As for control and expenditure discussions, I have heard the Minister say that one cannot win in this regard.  It is a good kick-back argument, which I understand, but when it comes to front-line services and the issues I have just outlined in the mid-west, the reality is it is affecting front-line staff such as nurses and doctors.  As with the issues mentioned by the Minister regarding the capital plan the two biggest jokes among the Minister's own staff, including management, is that the capital plan does not impact on capital projects down through the years.  They just laugh at that.  The second issue they laugh at is the idea that there is no recruitment freeze.  The Minister's own people laugh at that; they do not believe it.  When it comes to front-line staff, especially nursing and other posts, I ask the Minister to please show the necessary flexibility.<\/p><p> My last question is very important.

We are almost 500 above our budgeted for headcount this year, or, to be precise, 485 above the planned improvement.  Therefore, we have recruited and are continuing to recruit.  We recruited 60 in August and are targeting dedicated recruitment.  For example, we are in the process of recruiting graduate nurses, with a significant number of contracts offered on the community and acute sides.  We want to recruit these graduates.  As the national director, Mr. Liam Woods, said, we want to reduce our spend on agency staff as part of that process.

It was also raised by the Irish Pharmacy Union.  What is the proposal?  I understand that under the IPU's proposal, if the minor ailments scheme was to be introduced nationally, there would be about 1 million fewer prescriptions written and that there would, therefore, be a huge saving from the point of view of GPs.  There is a huge number of items that pharmacies cannot give out without a prescription.  Is this issue being looked at both from a cost savings point of view and also from the point of view of saving time for GPs?<\/p> <p>  The second issue concerns step-down facilities.  One of the issues in many hospitals arises where someone is admitted for reasonably minor surgery and has to be detained for two to three days.  We then find that he or she is in hospital for anything up to seven or ten days.  Is enough work being done to identify step-down facilities where the State would enter into a contract for the provision of these facilities?  It would be far cheaper than having people in hospital and there would be a faster turnover in hospitals.  Have we made any progress in trying to advance the provision of structured step-down facilities in each of the regional areas?  I can go back to 2004 or 2005, when there was talk of building co-located private hospitals on public hospital grounds, when we should be looking seriously at building step-down facilities reasonably adjacent to public hospitals.  Is that issue being looked at?<\/p> <p>  The other issue concerns children with disabilities.<\/p><p>I understand a few places such as the COPE Foundation and St. Michael's House which deal with children with disabilities have a scheme in place under which children with disabilities can stay with another family for a weekend to provide respite care for their parents.  Could we have an expansion of that scheme?  There are a huge number of families who want to make a contribution and they can do so by providing care for a child with disabilities over a weekend and, at the same time, giving some respite to his or her parents.  It is a very effective way of providing the service.  Is there any proposal to roll out the scheme further?  I know that it has to be carefully established and managed, but it is up and running and operating well.  Families who have become involved have found it extremely rewarding.  At the same time, it is extremely helpful for parents with children to care for a child with disabilities.  <\/p><p> I would appreciate responses on those three issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#UU00500","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":417,"content":"<p>I will deal with the first two.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will take the question about children with disabilities.  <\/p> <p>  On the minor ailments scheme, I am very glad that the Senator raised the issue because representatives of the Irish Pharmacy Union came to see me in the not-too-distant past.  It has been a really constructive partner on Sl&aacute;intecare and in coming up with ideas.  It has also been an extraordinarily good partner on Brexit preparedness in the group chaired by the Secretary General that works with external stakeholders.  I acknowledge that contribution.  We have run a minor ailments scheme on a pilot basis and I believe it has shown very good results.  If representatives of the IPU were here, they would be talking about the fact that it has been operated on a pilot basis for a long time and ask why it could not be expanded.  It is a fair point.  When I most recently met IPU officials, we asked that the IPU and the Health Research Board look together at how we could design a comprehensive minor ailments scheme in order that we could address exactly the points made by the Senator.  In return for doing this for the pharmacies, it would have a benefit for the hospitals.  I will check to see the exact stage the conversations are at and revert to the Senator in writing. <\/p> <p>  On the issue of step-down facilities, again, I agree 100% with the Senator.  There are two answers to his question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who had to leave to take questions on promised legislation in the D&aacute;il and the Minister of State, Deputy English, have pulled together a group in the areas of housing and health to look at how we can meet needs in communities.  We do not just look at building houses; we also look at the position where, if we build what used to be kownn traditionally as retirement villages within communities, we can decide whether it actually helps to keep older people in their community and out of hospital.   That is one body of work.  The second is that in the new integrated regional structures we will be mapping out exactly what they wlill be.  We talk about capacity a lot in the health service. There are real capacity constraints.  One area in which we potentially have spare capacity, or capacity that could be better utilised is smaller hospitals and community nursing units.  As part of the Sl&aacute;intecare mapping exercise for each of the new regional organisations, that issue will be looked at.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#VV00200","speaker":"1251"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":418,"content":"<p>On the respite care issue, it is part of the plan for respite care services that children will stay with families.  I am well aware of the issue because St. Michael's House and the COPE Foundation in Cork are involved, as the Senator said.  It is part of Jigsaw.  We have 8,600 people in residential care and in the region of 27,000 in day services.  Within respite care services, this year there will be 180,500 overnight stays and 3.08 million hours in home support services.  These are part of mainstream respite care mservices.  During the summer we opened our 12th respite care house.  Although it did not get a mention anywhere, 12 new respite care houses have been opened.  The final one was opened in the middle of the summer.  I thank the HSE for being on target.<\/p> <p>  As part of the respite care service, we have families coming forward to volunteer to assist other families, particularly those with high dependency young children and young adults with disabilities.  To the question of whether I believe in it, the answer is \"Yes\".  To the question of whether I support it and would encourage its expansion, the answer is absolutely \"Yes\".<\/p> <p>  There is a group in society which we know as carers.<\/p><p>There is a group of families who do very valuable work by providing services for young children and adults with disabilities, which we must support and I will support them.

Part of the process involves those who have no extended family, and people are often left in institutions in cases where their family members have died or it is very difficult for the family.

The Deputy has been a big believer that we should return to regional structures.  We are now doing that.  What is the appropriate number of therapists, nurses, doctors and everyone else that we need in each region based on the population?  I expect that the HSE, working with the Sl&aacute;intecare office, will make really good progress on that in the coming months.

Indeed, part of Deputy Durkan's constituency and certainly part of his county is involved in that.  The model has been used in other countries where it works really well.  Instead of a child going to a speech and language therapist, the speech and language therapist or occupational therapist goes to the school.  We do not have the evidence base yet and await the evaluation of the programme but from talking to parents and teachers I already know that the service is beneficial .

I fully agree with Deputy Durkan.  The issue that he has raised highlights the need for us to create community teams in areas.  I say that because where an area becomes so wholly dependent on any one healthcare professional, and things can happen in all of our lives in terms of career breaks, maternity leave, paternity leave and whatever, we obviously need to make sure that we do not build a system that is wholly reliant on one healthcare professional.  That is why I think the reforms we are bringing in through the creation of our community network teams, but also our work with education, lessens that reliance on any one individual.<\/p><p>What Members are seeing is that we are continuing to increase investment and staff numbers, yet we are continuing to see some of the challenges that Deputy Durkan has outlined.  That is certainly the direction of travel.<\/p><p> On the treatment abroad scheme and-or the cross-border directive, I have a very long table, which I will send to Deputy Durkan and circulate to the committee, that shows the procedures.  The major ones are orthopaedics and ophthalmology, for which people travel abroad.  I am glad that Deputy Durkan raised an interesting point about whether the taxpayer is funding treatments abroad that we should be doing here.  The short answer is that in some cases we could be doing better in Ireland.  For example, I constantly hear about ophthalmology and people going to the North to have their cataracts removed.  We have opened a new theatre in Nenagh at a cost of &euro;1 million last year, which it is fair to say has dramatically reduced the number of people waiting for cataract procedures and dramatically increased the capacity for this country, not just that region, to meet the cataract demand in the health service.  We must be looking constantly for opportunities - one might use the term low-hanging fruit - where we have level 2 hospitals, which back in the day were big emergency hospitals but no longer have an emergency department and have capacity.  Of course, that requires staffing, so it is not always as easily done as I have outlined.  The theatre in Nenagh is an example of where we are trying to do more here than we previously had the capacity to do and people had to go abroad.

Large tobacco and cigarette companies are mooching, so to speak, into vaping.  To bring it back to another issue, the rise of the global cannabis market is predicted to be &euro;123 billion by 2028.  It seems very clear that big tobacco is involved in this market as well.  It is similar in ways to the way that vaping has taken off.  As somebody who only has facts and science to rely on, it is becoming increasingly difficult to win the argument and it is actually easier at times just to say nothing and pretend that one does not know anything about things because the level of angst if a person stands up to something like this is to some people not worth it.  In my mind it is worth it.  I feel particularly strongly about this issue, and while I am a major supporter of and am pro-decriminalisation of drugs, I feel very strongly about the statutory instrument signed at the end of June, which is contrary to the legal advice provided to this committee and contrary to the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, advice.  In the HPRA report of 2016, Cannabis for Medical Use - A Scientific Review, the first paragraph of the executive summary states:<\/p><blockquote>To date there is an absence of scientific data demonstrating the effectiveness (efficacy) of cannabis products. <\/blockquote><p>It goes on to refer to conditions \"such as those for which there is a public interest\".  I am concerned that, due to public interest and a ferocious campaign for the authorisation of medicinal cannabis, we have somehow diluted our drug regulations.  The HPRA is only supposed to license and authorise medicinal products, and cannabis does not fit into that category.  We do not yet have any trial data, which is important to take on board, as it is for any other drug.<\/p><p> When it comes to public health, we are depending on big tobacco, via vaping, to tell people how to tackle a nicotine addiction.  How are we to deal with a market, which is potentially worth &euro;128 billion, and is currently worth &euro;60 billion to &euro;80 billion, that purports to have a miracle product that will cure everything?  We, as elected representatives, have to protect public health.  This feeds into the phenomena of fake news, anti-vaxxers, and significant marketing and online influencers.  We will face a public health nightmare in five or ten years because we will have diminished our regulation standards.  Could a pharmaceutical company challenge the Department on this?  Someone could rock up with cannabis, which does not have to go through the normal trials or regulatory process, while that company might have a drug that has gone through the trials and ticked all the boxes, and yet is not getting a marketing authorisation.<\/p><p> I also have an issue with the HPRA's remit, which at this point in time covers medical products.  The product being allowed onto the market, albeit with limited access, is simply not a medicine.  Populism has succeeded here to some extent.  It is easier to use a statutory instrument than to legislate on this issue.  I could be wrong but as a pharmacist, I feel strongly about drug regulation.  Any dilution of regulations will lead to public health issues in the future.  I realise I am standing alone on this issue because it seems like I do not want to give sick people and children this miracle medicine.  However, claims have been made about treatments that simply cannot be true and that eat into the sound advances made in public health.  Have the HSE or the Department predicted how we will deal with the challenges that will no doubt arrive on our doorstep in a number of years?  They will have arisen under the Minister's watch because of a statutory instrument that allowed a product with no scientific basis onto the market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#YY00900","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":445,"content":"<p>We do clinical trials all the time in Ireland and an expert group comprising scientists, neurologists, and others put the guidelines for this programme in place.

Is there any proposal from the Department to allow pharmacists to substitute biosimilar products?

My understanding is this could result in a health saving of between &euro;70 million and &euro;100 million, which would cover the cost of free contraception for the women of Ireland for a year.  When the Minister goes to the Minister for Finance, he could save him &euro;100 million and then bill him &euro;100 million.<\/p> <p>  We discussed the issue of contraception at length at the committee on the eighth amendment and the Government's approach was that contraceptives would be provided free of charge.

In the light of the upcoming budget and the time that has passed since the referendum, it is high time we followed through on the commitment given.  I know that the Minister has set up a new working group to consider the matter.

That person's care has been catered for since then by moving the person around three different respite centres because the person needs two-to-one care but the centre needs to be a closed centre when the person is there.  If the person was in one respite centre only, it would mean nobody in that area would get respite.  The person, therefore, has been moved around three centres.  Twice over the past ten months, a permanent external placement has been identified for that person but the funding fell through.  It means that, ten months on, the respite care for many people in the community is being affected and, of course, the placement that the person has is not what it should be because the person should be in a permanent residential centre.  I have followed the case closely.  It is unacceptable that it has not yet been dealt with.  I will pass the details on to the Minister and I hope I will not have to be back in three months, which would mark a year since the point when this person was first moved around various respite centres.

It might be more of a question where the HSE might come back to the committee.  There is a fundamental difference in views as to what is going on with nurses not being hired.  I have heard the HSE statement and the caveat that there is no embargo in place but there may be conditions where financial plans have not been sanctioned and therefore hospitals do not have permission to hire those personnel.  Will the HSE or the Department, whichever is the correct group, come back to the committee with a detailed explanation of what is going on?  There are 82 people sitting on trolleys in Limerick as we speak, but the nurses seeking jobs there have been told an embargo is in place.  Will the witnesses come back to the committee with a realistic picture of what is going on?  Which hospitals are actively hiring and which have been told that, for various reasons, they cannot currently hire those personnel?<\/p> <p>  As I stated, there are 82 people waiting on trolleys in Limerick as we speak, and although some will get beds today, more people will walk into the hospital throughout the day and tonight.  There are measures that could be taken today as opposed to long-term strategic and infrastructural capacity-building measures.  Home care package numbers could be increased as an emergency measure and there could be a pause on some non-urgent elective care.  More supports could be given to GPs very quickly so that patients who do not need to come into accident and emergency departments would not do so.  The nursing vacancies could be filled very quickly.  We know the numbers throughout the country for people waiting on trolleys is bad, but at 82, does the number for Limerick signify that this a crisis?  Could emergency measures therefore be taken so the people in Limerick could see some improvement right away?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#DDD01400","speaker":"1436"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":487,"content":"<p>As I have said to colleagues, and as Mr. Reid has said today as well, a couple of these measures have already started.

For example, we are seeing the number of delayed discharges finally beginning to fall after weeks of it rising.  It is still very high but it is decreasing.  We had another good engagement today, particularly with members from the mid-west and the Chairman, about doing something on diagnostics.  We are taking that away and we have agreed that HSE representatives will meet members from the mid-west within a fortnight to see how to progress the issue.  The core of the Deputy's question was what we can do now, as we are almost in winter, to improve flow, social care etc.  I expect that on budget day next Tuesday, we will be in a position to announce funding for the winter, from which Limerick and other parts of the country will benefit.

The Minister at the time indicated that he intended to bring in regulations to ensure that a high standard was applied and that we were complying in some way with the requirements.

The bottom line was that in order to comply with the directive, one needed to prescribe certain professionals and in order to do that, they needed to be regulated.  As the Deputy knows, chiropractors in our country are not regulated although in other countries they are.  It varies significantly across the European Union.  I am of the instinctive view that they are a group that should be regulated, but there is a long list of people seeking regulation.

Pulling all the stuff together than I have been talking about in the previous two rounds, has the Department plans for a massive public health campaign in terms of identifying what we can learn from where we failed before?  I refer to the vaccination rate with HPV vaccination dropping to 52%, which was not on the Minister's watch but it did happen, and to the great effort by all the witnesses, the late Laura Brennan and many others such that we collectively have got that rate back up.  In terms of public health education, if we look to some of the developing countries such as Rwanda with its vaccination programme, the programme is front-loaded with education and their system has worked well.  We are failing because we probably did not cop on quickly enough to the power of the Internet and of false claims.  As the Minister knows, I have my Bill, which is waiting to progress.  It is clear from the conversation about measles and mumps that people do not seem to realise how serious these conditions are.  The generation that saw these conditions is largely older.  My own mother is a retired public health nurse who specialised in infectious diseases so I am very much aware of the dangers associated with them.  However, it is very hard to fear what we cannot see.  Are we going to do anything to try to mitigate the risk of the propagation of false claims?  I am thinking of something to do with the value of science and fact, our institutions, the value of research and development.  Organisations such as the Irish Cancer Society clearly have public health as their remit.  There is a need to identify those whose remit is probably not public health but the bottom line on their balance sheet.  Beliefs are hard to change and I believe the only way we can do that is through education.  There is a shift whereby people are not going to listen to the celebrity chef as to what they should take to cure their terminal cancer.  However, the Department and the Minister need to pre-empt what is coming down the road in terms of slick marketing campaigns to get into people's pockets, essentially, and in some cases into the pockets of the Department, I would say, in terms of the funding of medicinal cannabis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#FFF00600","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":504,"content":"<p>The Deputy has one more question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HEJ2019100200002#GGG00100","speaker":"1275"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":505,"content":"<p>No, I am at 2 minutes 52 seconds.

The lie has got around the world before the truth puts its boots on.  One has to stand for something or one will fall for anything.  That is why I feel so strongly about this.  On the HPV vaccine for the boys, I congratulate everyone involved in the roll-out.  In light of its success, have we plans to vaccinate the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth-year pupils?  There seems to be such an appetite to do it.  I know it is another bill and the Minister is probably always presenting bills but the money will be saved in the long run.

When we engage with others outside our initial health family, our friend, the late Laura Brennan, obviously being a key example of that, but also lots of other organisations and people, we can see the energy and the movement that creates.  We launched the Vaccine Alliance on 10 September.  I am very excited about this.  We specifically put Science Foundation Ireland on it for that very reason.  It is doing its scoping exercise on the work it should do now.  They have Barnardos, USI, lots of doctors, parents and patient advocates.  It is a really good mix.  David Robert Grimes, whom the Deputy knows, is a really powerful advocate and is on that group.

They are seeing parents coming in asking for vaccines for their older sons.

The report entitled The Future of Policing in Ireland provides a roadmap for an improved policing service in Ireland.  This report identified that cybercrime and Internet-enabled crimes are proliferating fast and that Ireland is not alone in struggling to deal with the threat and that tackling cybercrime must be regarded as a core function of policing.  A central tenet of the report on the future of policing in Ireland is that policing is not something the police do alone.  Likewise, the solution to tackling online harassment, harmful communications and related offences will require the involvement of multiple stakeholders across various Departments, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and society in general, including parents, schools and employers.<\/p> <p>  The recent roll-out of the new operating model will enhance the investigation of crime through the delivery of a greater range of specialised services in local areas, such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cybercrime, and economic crime.  Each division will be provided with a detective superintendent who, along with trained investigators in specialist areas, will be responsible for local crime investigation.  Complex or highly technical crimes will generally be dealt with at national level.  This initiative will see the establishment of regional cybercrime hubs and trained first responders, who will support the regional units and provide for a tiered level of capability nationally, with the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, GNCCB, as the top tier of support and capability.<\/p> <p>  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau was established in September 2016, providing an enhanced structure within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purpose of tackling cybercrime.  The bureau has a national remit with regard to the phenomenon of cybercrime, and in particular, the investigation of online criminality.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is tasked with undertaking the forensic examination of computer media in all incidents reported to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau is currently supported by two regional pilot units, one based in New Ross Garda station, County Wexford, and the other in Ballincollig, County Cork.  The Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, in conjunction with the Garda College, has developed a training module relating to the investigation of cybercrime for delivery to all students attending the college.  It is planned that other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be trained in cybercrime awareness and cybercrime investigation through our continuous professional development network.<\/p> <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will further its long-standing relationship with the centre for cybersecurity and cybercrime investigation in University College Dublin through the GNCCB and alumni who have undertaken courses of study at the university in the cyberdomain.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also develop more educational partnerships with third level institutions and international institutions with expertise in cybersecurity in order to ensure cutting-edge support is available throughout the organisation.  The Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, was established in 2015 and is a specialist team dedicated to making sure each and every complaint relating to child protection, human trafficking and domestic and sexual violence is thoroughly investigated and that such investigations are handled in an appropriate manner.  In addition, the GNPSB is responsible for working with other agencies to manage sex offenders in the interest of community safety.<\/p> <p>  Increasingly, children are engaging in the sharing of self-taken imagery where they send nude or sexually explicit or both personal photographs of one another to other members of a chat group, utilising platforms such as WhatsApp or Instagram, or over social media such as Facebook or Snapchat.  While this scenario has given rise to a form of bullying, there is an added danger when images are circulated outside the confines of friends or otherwise become available to third parties, who may then use them as a trap to engage with a child or set up fake profiles, using the images as bait.  In 2015, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na established 28 victim service offices across the country which are tasked with communicating with victims of crime and prioritising their needs.  Protective service units, which will operate within each Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na division, will assist in ensuring that relevant child protection, domestic and sexual violence incidents are thoroughly investigated and victims fully supported.<\/p> <p>  Any individual, adult or child, business or organisation, using a connected device is vulnerable to cybercrime.  Just as with offline crime, simple steps can often be effective in reducing these vulnerabilities.  Working in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will use opportunities such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s communication channels, \"Crimecall\", public awareness campaigns and industry liaison to ensure people are educated on protecting themselves from cybercrime.  The investigation of all the relevant incidents and the examination of associated computer media is dependent on the disclosure of a criminal offence.  In cases involving the online safety of our young people, the primary offences are cyberbullying and sexual exploitation.  In this regard, the relevant legislative provisions are contained in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.<\/p> <p>  The Garda schools programme is currently being updated.  The Garda is working in partnership with Webwise to create modules within the Garda schools programme to be delivered to all primary and second level schools nationally, to include subjects such as cyberbullying, online harassment, consent and image sharing.  The \"Be in Ctrl\" programme was launched in 2018.  It is delivered to junior cycle second level students nationally.  It gives students the opportunity to recognise and understand online sexual coercion and extortion and will give them the information on how to deal with and report these incidents.  Three new modules are currently being created by Webwise and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are expected to be rolled out in 2020.  These would deal with cyberbullying and online harassment in primary school, the impact of cyberbullying and online harassment and the harm and legal consequences that image sharing has.  It encourages students on how to act responsibly when they encounter intimate content.  This is for both the junior and the senior cycle.<\/p> <p>  A new information and education resource called \"Lockers\" has been designed, in conjunction with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to assist schools in coping with and preventing the sharing of explicit self-generated images of minors.  Intended for use within the junior cycle social, personal and health education curriculum, \"Lockers\" is supported by a newly developed animation and six lesson plans, and includes an information section for school leaders.  This 25-page section informs principals on the context for sexting among young people, the laws that can come into effect when underage sexting occurs and the implications for school policy.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop its capacity and capability to tackle online harassment, harmful communications and related offences, and in this regard will interact in an appropriate manner with all relevant stakeholders. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Gubbins"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":525,"content":"<p>I thank Chief Superintendent Gubbins.

The ISPCC is delighted to be in a position to support this important draft legislation and thank Deputy Howlin for introducing it and the members for considering it in committee.  As the national child protection charity, I wish to present to members the ISPCC&rsquo;s perspective on how this Bill may pertain to children.<\/p> <p>  Research conducted for the ISPCC in 2018 found that almost half of children aged six to 18 years old were always online.  The ISPCC&rsquo;s Childline service answers over 1,000 contacts every day from children.  Many tell us about their experiences online.  For example, a 16 year old girl told Childline she had sent images to a former boyfriend, who then shared them with others without her permission.  With these images now circulating widely, this girl told Childline she could not face going back to school and was contemplating suicide.<\/p> <p>  Online safety is an integral part of the ISPCC&rsquo;s policy work.  We welcome the commitment by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to establish an office of digital safety commissioner, an office we see as imperative for championing children&rsquo;s online safety.<\/p><p>The ISPCC continues to call for the introduction of a long-term national strategy for online safety.  The ISPCC is acutely aware of the long-term and devastating consequences bullying and cyberbullying can have on children.  As cyberbullying can take place through any digital means of communication, it is essential that modern platforms are included in how this Bill defines \"communications\".  Content which is shared online often has the potential to reach very large audiences, very quickly.  Young people told the Law Reform Commission in 2016 that they felt practices such as identity theft, online harassment and the non-consensual sharing of intimate images should be made illegal.  Through the ISPCC's work with children and young people, however, we are acutely aware of the need for an age-appropriate response to the proposed offences as outlined in this Bill.  By their nature, children and young people do not have the maturity level of adults: they may exhibit a greater tendency to be impulsive and they may not fully comprehend the consequences their actions online may have.  In accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ISPCC would not advocate that children and young people under the age of 18 be criminalised for their behaviour.  Instead, it is essential they are educated and empowered to act differently in future.  Entry into the Garda youth diversion programme or similar may provide a more appropriate response.  Relative and relatable online safety education, delivered via the curriculum on a regular basis at both primary and post-primary level, is a key component in preventing these activities occurring in the first instance.<\/p><p> While we appreciate we are here today to explore proposed criminal justice responses to online safety, we need to take this opportunity to reiterate our call for industry regulation as a fundamental response too.  At present, industry regulation falls short of adequately protecting children online.  The ISPCC cannot support an approach of self-regulation of industry over legal regulation.  As the online world does not know borders in the same way as they pertain to the physical world, the ISPCC believes it is important to monitor international developments.  The Criminal Justice and Courts Act and the Voyeurism (Offences) Act, as recently introduced in the UK, make the practices referred to as revenge porn and upskirting criminal offences.  At an ISPCC event held in December 2018, the eSafety Commissioner of Australia outlined how the office has successfully assisted more than 1,000 young Australians to remove cyberbullying material.  The office is equipped with regulatory powers to penalise and fine social media companies should they fail to remove such content.  Children have a right to be protected and this protection extends to being online.  Legislation and regulation which strives to make the online world a safer place for children must be duly considered, respecting the particular rights and needs of child victims and child perpetrators.  We reiterate our point that such legislation, however, should not criminalise children and young people.  The ISPCC views the education and empowerment of children to become civic online citizens as the ultimate goal for which to strive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Church","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":528,"content":"<p>Before I bring Professor Carthy in, I wish to make a point of clarification.

It emerged from our work programme for substantive address in the widest possible way.

In the interests of time, I will keep my submission brief.  I will concentrate on two issues I believe are important in this area.  The first is regulation.  There is no history to show that a lack of regulation or self-regulation in any industry has worked.  We are relying on self-regulation very often in the cyberworld, which is a grave error.  Automobile legislation offers a very good model for the cyberworld.  Every car in the country is required to have a number plate, which can be used to identify the owner.  A similar system in the cyberworld, where users could be identified would greatly diminish instances of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, hate speech and so on.  If we could legislate in this key area it would make a significant difference.  I accept the details would have to be worked out very carefully.  First, social media platforms and online providers would have to register their users and the users would provide appropriate evidence of identity.  In the case of minors, parents or guardians would be responsible.  Second, users or parents who can show that they have been bullied, harassed or abused on a social media platform, should be legally entitled to find out the identity of the user carrying out the inappropriate behaviour.  That one simple measure would make a significant difference in this area.  I accept there is an international dimension but other countries would look to Ireland to set a lead and Ireland could pursue it at an EU level.<\/p> <p>  Computer users have a responsibility as well.  Again, the automobile industry offers an example in that we must have a national car test, NCT, on our cars.  We cannot put an unsafe car on the road.  If we have a computer system there is an obligation on us to have appropriate anti-virus software installed in order that our computers cannot be hacked, our information cannot be stolen or, equally important, that our computers cannot be infected by malware, which allows them to partake in attacks on computers on the Internet, unbeknownst to us.  That is a widespread problem.  Thousands of Irish computers are currently infected by such software.  The regulation could be such that if one is going on the Internet, one must ensure one has appropriate anti-virus software on one's computer.<\/p> <p>  In terms of keeping children safe, the concept of a digital safety commissioner is valuable but we must make sure the office has the correct mandate and the resources to carry out the tasks assigned to it.  We also need public awareness campaigns.  Again, to return to the automobile situation, the Road Safety Authority has a fantastic public awareness campaign and a similar campaign is required in terms of cyberawareness for parents and children.  Digital literacy education must be improved at primary level so that all children and teachers are aware of the risk and dangers of using computers online.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Joe Carthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":530,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Carthy.

The RCNI is grateful to have this opportunity to share its views on online harassment, harmful communications and related offences with the committee.  Our clients of all ages are now reporting to us more and more forms of online sexual harassment and harmful communications of an intimate nature.  Effective regulation, via the criminal justice system and otherwise, generally has not kept pace with developments in online technologies and the almost universal use of Internet-accessible devices.  Many forms of online sexual harassment and harmful communications are covered by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 and related legislation on child pornography but there are wide gaps in the criminal law as far as adult victims are concerned.  To us, these forms of sexual harassment are a form of sexual violence, and should be regarded as seriously as contact sexual offences.  Their impacts on their victims are just as grave and potentially far reaching.  Accordingly, we think it is appropriate to describe this behaviour as image-based sexual abuse.  It is difficult to compile an exhaustive list of all the forms which this might take.  They include sextortion, deep-faking, flashing, what is commonly but inaccurately referred to as revenge porn, and perhaps most disturbingly, the recording and distribution of videos of acts of sexual assault and rape.  They need to be addressed urgently to deter and where necessary, punish, perpetrators of grave harm through online technologies.<\/p> <p>  There have been some very encouraging positive developments in recent years, not least the Bill introduced by Deputy Howlin, which is based mainly on the relevant provisions in the draft Bill in the Law Reform Commission's Report on Harmful Communications and Digital Safety.  The RCNI broadly welcomes this Bill and would like to see it progress as quickly as possible.  In particular, we welcome the inclusion of section 4, concerning the distribution of intimate images without consent, which will address that form of image-based sexual abuse consisting of the one-off sending of intimate images online to third parties.  The current law on harassment covers only persistent communications made directly to the victim.<\/p><p>To give another positive example, the Law Reform Commission also put forward the idea of a digital safety commissioner&rsquo;s office, which would be responsible for regulating online service providers&rsquo; procedures and practices, especially in respect of take-down of harmful material.  This has also found expression in proposed legislation, such as the Digital Safety Commissioner Bill 2017, a Private Members' Bill put forward by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  <br\/><br\/>We refer briefly to some of the principal recommendations RCNI makes in its full submission.  I hope it is in order to state that the recommendations refer to the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Bill 2017, which is a Private Members' Bill.  It is recommended to consider separating the current proposed section 4 of the Bill into three distinct offences: generation of intimate images without consent, alteration of images to make them appear to be intimate images without consent, and their storage, distribution, publication, sale, etc, also without consent; to ensure that the wording of any offence or definition used in any offence covers originally innocent images of the victim that have been altered to appear to include intimate images of third parties, in order that it cannot be argued by the defence that the genitalia, anal region, etc., of the victim are not in fact depicted in the intimate image in question; to include, as has been done in Scotland, separate voyeurism related offences, to cover viewing victims without consent in intimate settings, installing equipment to record intimate images of them, recording such images, and storing, distributing, publishing or selling them, in each case without consent; to create a new offence of producing and distributing audiovisual images of acts of sexual violence without consent and attach significant penalties to it, an activity that should be an offence whether it takes place online or offline; to consider criminalising the intentional or reckless impersonation of others, real or fictional, in online interactions, which can be extremely harmful in a sexual context; to include a review clause and give responsibility for carrying out the review to the digital safety commissioner or a similar official, pending the creation of a new digital safety commissioner&rsquo;s office or a similar body, responsibility for which should be given to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; and to include provision to hear cases related to online harassment, harmful communications and related offences, <i>in camera<\/i>, ideally irrespective of whether their content amounts to image based sexual abuse. <br\/><br\/>I thank members for their patience.  RCNI thanks the committee most sincerely for taking the time, through the submission process and hearings, to consider these most important issues for all survivors of this form of sexual violence and all those at risk of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#F00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Caroline Counihan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":533,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Counihan and each of our contributors.

I always defensively preface the following point by insisting I am not in favour of censorship, restriction or anything like that but I seek our guests' views on a matter.  Further guests will come before the committee and I would also like to hear their views.  Legislation reflects the actions of people, and whether they do something that could be deemed an offence or whether an offence needs to be created.  The core problem is that some platforms are completely unregulated.  There is an insane, wild west scenario.  It is impossible to imagine television, radio or newspapers uniformly stating that even though they broadcast, transmit or publish something, they have no responsibility for it.  For some reason, however, long after the birth of the Internet and such platforms, we continue to tolerate, not just in our country but internationally, the notion that large, multi-billion euro, profitable corporations can continue in this fashion.  That is the heart of what we have to grasp.<\/p> <p>  The reason I commented on censorship is that when I make the next point, people might say, \"My God.\"  I am not in any way a fan of what the Chinese Government or other totalitarian regimes do in restricting the ability of people to post on or access the Internet.  Given that large corporations continue to interact in such jurisdictions, however, there must be a way, whether through delay, content monitoring or responsibility, that we can bring some of that to the wild west that currently operates in the western world.  One measure we should move towards is the notion that victims would have the right to sue platforms.  If there were a few substantial settlements, the providers would move quickly.  What are our guests' views on that?  Do they believe litigation and so on will have to be at the heart of reform in how we will deal with the matter in the next ten, 15 or 20 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#G00300","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":535,"content":"<p>Where will the Deputy direct his question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#G00400","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I would like to hear a range of views.

Nevertheless, I must qualify that by stating it is not a bad thing in itself because it still puts too great an onus on the victim.  What will happen is that people will say they cannot face such proceedings, that they do not care about the money, and that all they want is for the content to be taken down and reversed as far as possible.  They will say they want the process to happen in peace and privacy, quickly and cheaply.  The process has to work for victims.<\/p> <p>  In our various submissions to the committee, we have argued strongly that the role of the digital safety commissioner should include oversight of companies to ensure they keep up to certain standards.  The commissioner should oversee any take-down procedure and there should be a right of appeal to the commissioner if there is any failure in such a procedure.  Ultimately, the process should be backed by civil sanctions.

It is ridiculous that any software provider in the world can produce a new application, launch it on the Internet and allow people to use it without any measure of its safety or of how it protects the data of the people involved.  Software designers are allowed to make their software do whatever they want with impunity.  We do not allow such practice in the aviation or automobile industry.  Definite controls are needed in that regard.  The Deputy is correct that billion-dollar companies make billions of dollars every year.  There is a cost of doing business and the cost for the automobile industry is that its cars must be safe, adhere to pollution standards and so on.<\/p><p>I would argue that there is a cost of doing business in this space, namely, people should regulate the content and ensure it is legal in whatever way that is defined by countries.  There is no technological reason for not doing so.  I would argue that it is a legislative matter.  The automobile industry offers an excellent example.  Although this situation is not something that we can fix quickly, we have been dealing with automobile legislation for 100 years and every year we tweak it a little.  We need to do the same in this context, but we need to start somewhere.  We probably will not get the legislation right initially, but we need to keep tweaking it over the years.

We constantly get children ringing us about online issues, but they do not say that they are ringing about an online issue, as children do not talk about online or offline.  This is the space they are living in and they are active in it every single day of the week.  Half the children between six and 18 years of age are online every day, but that figure is 94% for 16 to 18 year olds.  This is their life.  This is where they are living.<\/p> <p>  Self-regulation does not and will not work.  That ship has sailed.  I welcome the Minister's position on this matter, and we would actively support it.  In Australia, there is an interesting concept of co-regulation.  Getting representatives from the platforms around the table and having an adult and mature conversation is the only way to go.  From speaking to the larger platforms, I know that they are spending millions of euro on trying to tackle this, but they were not set up with the express objective of protecting children.  They are commercial operations.  We are talking about YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, but this issue extends way beyond them.  We are getting calls every day about new games that are launching and apps, including smaller ones, some of which require in-app purchases.  To use the Deputy's phrase, it is the Wild West.  The only way we can tackle this is through actual regulation.  I always use the analogy of how every other form of media that we look at is regulated.

The latter is something that we do not address often enough.  Anyone can set up a successful business that sells drugs.  There is no regulation or anything.  It is just illegal, which is why such businesses are not set up, but one could sell drugs and make large amounts of money.  In the case of what we are discussing, though, we are in a strange situation wherein it is claimed that, because someone can build a technology with peer-to-peer or end-to-end encryption, he or she should be able to do it.  There may be some social good in certain contexts.  For example, we have seen protest movements around the world and people who are involved in trying to tackle unsavoury regimes using technology for good.  Having also seen the level of damage being done, however, we must be able to do something.  I am 50 something years of age, and Mr. Church's statistic about how virtually every aspect of 16 to 18 year olds' lives is online is frightening.  Deputy Jack Chambers is much younger than me, but many of us present probably grew up prior to the age when everything was available online - every photo of every birthday, every family moment, everything we did in school, etc.  That is terrifying to people who did not grow up with it, as is knowing that companies can use and exploit it or facilitate people who want to harass, bully or harm others.  I hope that we move to regulate it and that there will be a penalty for the perpetrators, but the people actually making the billions of euro will get to walk away scot-free and live a lifestyle thanks to something that has caused endless harm.  At a certain point in 20, 30 or 40 years' time, we as a society will look back on this period aghast that we put up with this and said that we had to do so because there was no way around it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#H00700","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":547,"content":"<p>I do not think there is any need to put what the Deputy has just said to the panel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#H00800","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":548,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#H00900","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":549,"content":"<p>I anticipate a concurrence.

A part of the problem in a discussion about the Internet is that it can be broad, given the panorama of the Internet.  As such, I would like to examine one or two specific issues and probe how to deal with them.  Ms Counihan and Mr. Church raised an example - a woman under 18 years of age who is in a relationship consents in that relationship to intimate photographs being taken, but the relationship breaks down and her ex-partner subsequently posts the photographs online.  Could we probe this example for a while?  I would like to see how we might deal with it.  That would give us a good roadmap for how to deal in general with these issues.<\/p> <p>  It appears to me that her right to privacy has been breached.  Had those photographs been published in a newspaper, the courts would hold under the European convention and Irish constitutional law that the consent to the photograph being taken was a consent that was given in the context of a private relationship between her and her partner at the time.  If her privacy has been broken - I believe it has - the difficulty that she faces at the outset is that, in order to give effect to that breach of privacy, she probably has to go to court.  Do the witnesses believe it is necessary for us to put on a statutory basis the right to privacy that this woman has, which is a constitutional and convention right but is not given expression in Irish statute?  I will turn to the criminal aspects subsequently but in terms of the civil aspects, does Ms Counihan believe that there should be a law of privacy that sets out the woman's right?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#H01100","speaker":"1296"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569970800,"counter":551,"content":"<p>I would love it.

I could not disagree with anything that Ms Counihan and Deputy O'Callaghan have said thus far.  The right to privacy is definitely an issue but as I said earlier to Deputy Brophy, the platforms are putting a lot of money and resources into this area.  I met representatives of Facebook recently.  That company employs approximately 30,000 people worldwide whose sole job is to take down inappropriate images.  Recently I read that something like 2.6 million inappropriate images were removed in one quarter, that is, in a three month period.  As I said earlier, these platforms were not set up to protect children.  They were set up to make a profit and while they are extremely beneficial to many people and add to effective communications, we would not let our road network run riot, with no lines in the middle of the road, no rules and no traffic lights but we are letting the equivalent happen with the internet.  Let us be clear, the ISPCC is not seeking to shut down the internet.

It is extremely beneficial but as with roads, which are also very beneficial, we need laws and rules.  The only way to do this is to have a proper regulator with teeth.

If Deputies are heading off to fulfil any other engagement or responsibility, I ask them to keep an eye on the monitors and join us at the end of the meeting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#K02000","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":599,"content":"<p>I thank the delegates for their contributions.  I want to tease out the issues a little.  It was stated correctly that there were some pieces of legislation.  I note that Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire has a Bill, as does Deputy Howlin.  A number of Deputies have brought forward legislation to deal with some aspect of the subject.  While that is part of it, our work involves looking at the bigger picture to see how it can be added to, expanded and turned into something which will be robust and strong enough to deal with these issues.  I am aware, as the previous speaker said, that there is an international dimension as the material goes outside the jurisdiction.  We do not how one would reach a platform based, for example, in Azerbaijan.  That is one of our difficulties.<\/p> <p>  I return to the key points and the example Deputy Jim O'Callaghan gave or a similar case.  While there is a civil case a person could take against an individual who has posted the piece of information or image and there may also be an element that could constitute a criminal case, the difficulty most people have is that, as regards the ability for it to be shared and the responsibility of those who share it, the company involved steps back and leaves the individuals involved to fight it out among themselves.  The company gets away without having to take any real responsibility.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of points I want to make.  On traceability, surely there is a sense that there is almost a fingerprint for each individual engaged on the Internet.  We all hear, at least anecdotally, that all of the companies are geniuses at being able to trace and know everything about every part of our lives and that they engage in all of this analysis to determine whether we like country and western music or opera, or whether we are into this, that or the other.  From our interactions with others, they can almost identify people.  If they are already doing this, mainly through the use of artificial intelligence and various algorithms, it suggests that it would not be that difficult to to identify each individual, even where someone uses a false name and identity.  From his or her interactions with others, they will get to know who a person is and what is what.  In being able to find out his or her identity, is there a case for making a company responsible for being able to identify each person?<\/p> <p>  The example of the automobile industry was given.  For instance, if any of us here produced a piece of electronic equipment, we would have to send it away to be tested to obtain CE certification to indicate that it was valid and could be sold and used.  Surely if any of us here produced an app, there should be an authority somewhere where it would have to be tested to ensure it was fit for purpose and use.  Is there an international example of such an agency - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might know - that does this or is there any effort at European level to do it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#K02100","speaker":"1345"},{"type":"speech","time":1569970800,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I will start with Chief Superintendent Gubbins.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2019100200002#K02200","speaker":"1269"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1569970800,"counter":601,"content":"<p>I will have a go at answering that question.  I will come back to what Professor Carthy stated about people having to prove who they are and their identity.  <\/p> <p>  In the nature of the business my colleagues and I are in, people do it on a regular basis, but they use a false identify.  No matter what we put in place, people will always find a way around it.  We must take this into consideration.  It impacts on traceability.  From what we have seen in some cases, people will generally create a new account to accommodate some of their criminal activities online.  It will not be personal, for example, to Michael Gubbins.<\/p><p>Such people will create a pseudonym when they go online, so there will be no history to support their identification.  The Deputy spoke about companies' responsibilities.  He is right.  I always look at the privileges and responsibilities of those big service providers.  They are big companies that make big money and they support a lot of employment, but they have a responsibility to protect citizens and their users, whether in Ireland or abroad.  We are here in this room this morning but those companies are not.  Some of what we are looking at is a new phenomenon.  We need to talk to these companies.  The Deputy is right to say that many clever people work for them.  We need them to face the issues that have developed as a result of their products.  The Deputy spoke about CE marking for cars and other products.  Because of how these service providers' applications facilitate us - and it might be one application today but another in the future - we need to be able to identify issues and ask them how they can help and what they can suggest in that regard.  <\/p><p> There are competing demands in the area of privacy of data and retaining information.  Companies might be headquartered in Ireland but the data for which we are looking might be somewhere else.  We then need to use mutual legal assistance treaties to get those data.  It can take a while to get through that process and, when the request is responded to, the data might not be there so the next step might not be available to us.  As a result of GDPR and so on, it is less likely that data will be available to help us with our investigations.  As Detective Superintendent Ryan said earlier, time is of the essence.  There is probably an opportunity for Ireland to take the first step in working with these bigger companies to find solutions as many of them have headquarters here.  We need to push it out, rather than looking outside and bringing it in.

The Deputy makes a very interesting and valid point about traceability and fingerprints.  Many intelligent people are able to figure out who we are.  I am not about to open the debate on the digital age of consent again, but the big issue we have is that children and young people, by their very nature, lie about their age to get onto these platforms.  There needs to be a greater onus on the Facebooks of this world to verify that age.  Many 13 year olds want to go into the discos where the 16 year olds are.  It is absolutely normal behaviour for children and young people.  There should be more of an onus on the companies in that regard.  In my opening statement, I made reference to the industry event the ISPCC ran with Technology Ireland, a trade association under IBEC.  The industry was present at that event.  We talked about the whole concept of safety by design and about encouraging, rather than forcing, platform and app developers to take child safety into consideration in this regard.  We talked about the idea of a CE-type mark.  That idea came up.  To the best of my knowledge, mobile phone operators in the UK are forced to issue phones set up as if they were to be bought by children.

I thank the Law Society for its submission, in which it points out that we rely on the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951 to deal with some of these issues.

In the context of intimate partner violence, the mechanism by which the harm is caused and the nature of the harm is sometimes entirely individual and personal.  For instance, in a pattern of coercive control, an abuser will often know exactly what will drive his victim mad and distress her the most.  Because he knows her situation, he knows exactly what to say to her boss to cause her untold problems at work.  I am in favour of a broad definition.  Abuse is very often individually tailored to the circumstances, particularly in a long-term abusive relationship.  One cannot be too definite.

I wish to follow up on the point my colleague, Deputy Connolly, made.  We have many suggestions for legislation.  Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned codifying the right to privacy.  Others have mentioned verification of identity, which is important.  Has any country brought those moving parts together in any way?  We are at a very primitive stage in addressing this.  The witnesses are all nodding their heads, which I will take as confirmation.  Mr. Gubbins made an interesting point, which follows what Professor Carthy said.  One issue that seems to arise from the get-go is that a false identity can be used to create an account or multiple accounts.  If we legislated to require age verification, it would mean that the publisher, that is, the account holder, could not hide behind anonymity.  That seems to be a huge issue across all social media platforms.  A lot of these problems proliferate through fake accounts.  It could be simple legislation.  The problem arises in making it cross-jurisdictional and regulating it.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on that?<\/p> <p>  I believe that if people express something, they should stand by it, whether it relates to what we are talking about today or is potentially defamatory, as Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned.  If a journalist writes something, it is published in a newspaper and the journalist stands over what he or she has written.

It can be solved by the technology in a very straightforward way and it would make a huge difference.  We cannot overstate the difference verification would make.

Many of these issues could be resolved with a verification process because we would see a levelling of people.  As Professor Carthy said, the majority of people are there to have a community platform.  Many residents' associations have internal groups where everyone knows each other and is properly verified.  The external manifestation of many of these platforms involves anybody and everybody and the same individuals behind multiple accounts.  There is no technological difficulty but a commercial one.  There is a lot of discussion about corporation tax in an Irish context but we have a responsibility in the global context to properly regulate these entities because they constitute a platform of significant harm, as the witnesses have all noted.

Deputy Chambers covered many of the questions I wanted to ask.  This area is a minefield.  As Deputy Connolly said, it is very upsetting to hear about what is happening.

I often think \"my God, what's ahead for them?\"  To think about what can happen to children between the ages of six and 18 who are online is pretty shocking.<\/p> <p>  Some of the recommendations in Professor Carthy's presentation were very interesting.  His presentation was really powerful.  As he notes, it is quite simple.  It is not rocket science but I imagine there would be a significant backlash from the big corporations because Professor Carthy's suggestion will have an impact on their profits.  I know what that is like in here and what such a battle can look like and about trying to get as much support for what one is trying to do.  I know Airbnb has a system where someone registers for an account and must provide a scanned version of his or her passport to verify his or her identity.  That is one example of how it works.
