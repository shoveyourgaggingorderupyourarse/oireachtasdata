They provide a local forum where strategic, multi-agency approaches are implemented. LCDCs bring together representatives from the community, local government, State agencies and local development bodies to develop and agree coordinated responses to locally agreed priorities. Local Economic and Community Plans are used by LCDCs to facilitate a more joined-up approach. These plans are being implemented across the country with local authorities and LCDCs now positioned as key drivers of local economic and community development.<\/p>  <p>  It is important that we continue to support the LCDC structures as the primary vehicle for collaboration between all national public service providers at local level. For example, LCDCs and the Local Economic and Community Plans (LECP) provide a governance, planning and evidence based framework for the co-ordination and management of local funding including EU supported community-led local development funding to 2027. The Public Participation Network (PPN) also augments the LCDC and Local Authority supports for community led projects around the country.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to energy generation projects, the Climate Action Plan 2021 sets a clear goal of having at least 500 MW renewables delivered through local community-based projects. These projects will be delivered through the dedicated Community category in the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) as well as through the forthcoming Microgeneration &amp;amp; Small-Scale Generation schemes. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, through the SEAI, has provided initial seed funding of &euro;200k to support the establishment of the Community Enabling Framework under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS). A further &euro;2m in capital funding has been allocated to support the development of Community projects in 2022. The funding allocation this year will allow SEAI to rollout a trusted advisory service and enabling grants that are vital supports to enable the growth of the nascent community renewable electricity generation sector. <\/p>  <p>  In addition to these measures, through Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Clean Energy for EU Islands initiative, our rural island communities can be part of the clean energy transition of the more than 2,200 inhabited European islands.

In this regard, my Department has offered every flexibility to Local Development Companies, freeing around 600 Community Development Workers to help support arrivals from Ukraine into their locality. In addition, organisations supported under the Community Services Programme can include Ukrainian arrivals in the target groups for their services. In some cases, exceptional additional funding for staff resources is being provided by my Department to organisations providing volunteer support in frontline reception hubs.<\/p><p>My Department has committed to meeting regularly with key national stakeholders from the Community and Voluntary sector and recently hosted an information webinar attended by over 160 participants from organisations involved in the Ukraine response effort. The webinar provided information, disseminated key messages and encouraged communication and co-ordination.<\/p><p>I recognise that the capacity, willingness and expertise exists at local level to co-ordinate responses, signpost services, and link voluntary and statutory efforts. Huge efforts were made by volunteers during the pandemic, and dedicated volunteers across the country are already working again to help people from Ukraine arriving in Ireland. Government is working to ensure that local capacity, resources and knowledge are brought to bear on the overall humanitarian response and will work closely with Local Authorities to ensure a well-co-ordinated and seamless approach.  <\/p><p>Building on structures developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Response Fora are being repurposed in each local authority area. The role of each Forum will be to coordinate the community-led response in the provision of assistance and support to Ukrainian refugees as they are accommodated around the country.  <\/p><p>In this regard, my Department, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has prepared a Community Response Framework to guide that work. It sets out a national template for arrangements to be put in place in each area to enable all involved at a local level to work together to support the integration of Ukrainian refugees to our communities, under the stewardship of the local authorities. <\/p><p>Local Community Development Committees<b><\/b>(LCDCs) are strategically well-placed to assist with the local responses, linking in with state bodies represented on the LCDCs and with other local authority services and initiatives. In this regard, both the Chair and the Chief Officer of the LCDC are members of the relevant Community Response Forum.  <\/p><p>Public Participation Networks<b><\/b>(PPNs) in many local authority areas are serving as networking and information hubs for community and local member groups in their area. PPNs are providing information and resources on how people can assist or donate aid, and coordinating information from those responding to the crisis.<\/p><p>Our volunteer support programme, which includes Volunteer Ireland and the network of volunteer centres, is heavily engaged in sourcing volunteers to address the many requests for specific volunteer roles emerging across the country.

The system is, by design, vacancy led and driven by the changing needs of the labour market.<\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s general policy is to promote the sourcing of labour and skills needs from within the workforce of Ireland, the European Union and other EEA states. Employment opportunities which arise in Ireland should, in the main, be offered to suitably skilled Irish and other EEA nationals and should only be offered to non-EEA nationals who possess those skills and where no suitable candidate emerges from within the EEA to fill the vacancy. This policy fulfils our obligations under the Community Preference principles of membership of the EU.<\/p><p>In order to safeguard the employment opportunities of Irish\/EEA nationals, restrictions exist on the granting of employment permits. Among the safeguards is the requirement for an employer to satisfy a Labour Market Needs Test before a General Employment Permit can be issued to a non-EEA national. Further protections in place include proof of an employer\/employee relationship and minimum remuneration levels. Employment permit holders have exactly the same protections under Irish employment law as any other worker in the State.<\/p><p>Employment permit policy is part of the response to addressing skills deficits which exist and are likely to continue into the medium term, but it is not intended over the longer term to act as a substitute for meeting the challenge of up-skilling the State&rsquo;s resident workforce.

1 September next.

It is estimated that there are over 16,200 life years lost, while many people also experience a poor quality of life due to the associated short-term and long-term health impacts of this form of pollution.    The National Peatlands Strategy acknowled`ges the tradition of burning peat in Ireland, but also recognises that the associated emissions to the air contain a range of pollutants. Research undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency also demonstrates that the contribution of peat to air pollution levels is significant.<\/p>  <p>  Turf cutting by citizens for use in their own homes is a traditional activity across many peatlands, and while\u00a0measures are required to reduce the emissions associated with burning peat, these traditions will be respected. <\/p>  <p>  Therefore, in order to accommodate those with rights to harvest sod peat, no ban on its cutting or burning will be introduced, but a regulatory provision will be made to prohibit the placing on the market, sale or distribution of sod peat.

A consultation on the MAC assessment regime for Relevant Projects concluded in February.   Alongside this, my Department have been drafting the terms and conditions for offshore wind-specific auctions under the Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS).

I can confirm that the scheme is available only to operators holding a road haulage operator licence. <\/p>  <p>  In deciding on this targeted, temporary scheme, the Government considered that the licensed haulage sector is a specific case for several reasons, primarily that the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of a functioning supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and around the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity. While this is true for certain other operators also, fuel represents a greater overall proportion of overhead cost for hauliers than would be the case for other businesses who self-provide transport as part of their wider business. <\/p>  <p>  Given the rapid increase in fuel prices linked to the crisis in Ukraine, the haulage sector reported to the Government a serious risk of cessation of business among haulage companies that would have had significant implications for supply chains into the State, including for essential goods. <\/p>  <p>  You will be aware that on 9 March 2022, in recognition of rising fuel costs for all citizens and businesses, the Government reduced Excise duty by 20 cent per litre of petrol, 15 cent per litre of diesel and 2 cent in the excise duty charged on marked gas oil in order to reduce the cost of fuels. <\/p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has written to the European Commission to ask what flexibilities might be available on an emergency basis to reduce the tax on fuel.

In the meantime, my Department will continue with its transitional arrangements as we move towards formal blended working arrangements. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500069#WRJ00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1465"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Driver Test","counter":420,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500069#WRJ00500"},{"type":"question","counter":421,"qnumday":219,"qnumall":"[18255\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500069#WRJ00600","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if the case of a person (details supplied) will be reviewed; if an appointment for a driving test will be expedited; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1557","askee":"1465"},{"type":"speech","counter":422,"content":"<p>The protocols employed for scheduling driving test appointments is an operational matter for the Road Safety Authority, who are statutorily responsible for the operation of the National Driving Test Service.<\/p><p>I have therefore referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for direct reply.

I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport, nor decisions on fares. <\/p>  <p>  It is the National Transport Authority (NTA) that has the statutory responsibility for the regulation of fares in relation to public passenger transport services and also has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public transport services by way of public transport services contracts in respect of services that are socially necessary but commercially unviable.  The funding of those services comprises both the fares paid by passengers and the subvention payments from the Exchequer.  The main purpose of the subvention payment is to meet the gap between income from fares and the cost of operating services.<\/p>  <p>  The provision of public transport services is heavily dependent on passenger fare revenue as it normally contributes about 65% of the operational cost.  The remaining 35% of cost is covered by the PSO grant and the Department of Social Protection grant under the free travel scheme.  <\/p>  <p>  Prior to COVID-19, &euro;287 million of Exchequer funding was provided for PSO services in Budget 2020; however, since 2020, additional funding has been required to continue to address the significant COVID impacts on public transport provision. <\/p>  <p>  In 2022, I secured &euro;538m to support PSO services including over &euro;200m to address COVID expenses (i.e. loss of fare revenue, cleaning costs). Up to &euro;12m will be provided as ongoing support for the licensed bus sector; while, over &euro;15m has also been allocated to support Local Link regular service provision in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The Government is strongly committed to helping combat the rising cost-of-living being experienced throughout the country. In this context, a suite of new measures is being introduced by Government to help with this issue, including a 20% average fare reduction on all PSO services until the end of 2022. These discounted fares will benefit the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who use PSO public transport every day. &euro;54m in Exchequer funding has been secured to allow for the introduction of these discounted fares.<\/p>  <p>  Also, in recognition of the importance of incentivising young people to use public transport, as part of Budget 2022 I secured &euro;25m of funding to provide for the introduction of a young adult card (YAC) which will allow any person nationwide who is between 19 and 23 years old, to avail of an entitlement for discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average of discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. It is envisaged that the discount will initially be made available on PSO services, and then broadened to include commercial operators at a later date.  This will not only promote modal shift in the transport sector among this age group but should also contribute towards a reduced reliance on private transport with associated benefit of transport emission savings.<\/p>  <p>  The PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money, and funding has increased in recent years to cater for additional services and growing capacity.  Any assessment of a proposed change to public transport fare structures would be a matter for the NTA to consider in the first instance.  Therefore, I have forwarded the Deputy's specific question in relation to the estimated cost of waiving public transport fees for persons in possession of a student leap card. to the NTA for direct reply.

Disabled Passengers Scheme (DDS) provides relief from VRT and VAT on the purchase and use of an adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.<\/p><p>The Scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons who also meet one of six specified medical criteria, as a driver or as a passenger and also to certain organisations. In order to qualify for relief, the applicant must hold a Primary Medical Certificate issued by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer (SAMO) or a Board Medical Certificate issued by the Disabled Driver Medical Board of Appeal. Certain other qualifying criteria apply in relation to the vehicle, in particular that it must be specially constructed or adapted for use by the applicant. In the event that a PMC is not granted by the relevant Senior Area Medical Officer an appeal may be made to the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal (DDMBA) who operate out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire.<\/p><p>The current medical criteria were included in the Finance Act 2020, by way of amendment to Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989. This amendment arises from legal advice in light of the June 2020 Supreme Court judgement that the medical criteria in secondary legislation was not deemed to be invalid, nevertheless it was found to be inconsistent with the mandate provided in Section 92 of the Finance Act 1989 (primary legislation).<\/p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate this Scheme confers substantial benefits to eligible persons and changing the medical criteria to more general mobility-focused criteria, would raise the already considerable cost of the Scheme in terms of tax foregone to the Exchequer. Any increase in the cost of the Scheme would require a concomitant increase in tax, reduction in public expenditure, or increase in the Exchequer deficit.<\/p><p>While I am very aware of the importance of this scheme to those who benefit from it, I am also aware of the disquiet expressed by members of this house and others in respect of the difficulties around access to the scheme.<\/p><p>Accordingly, I gave a commitment to the House that a comprehensive review of the scheme, to include a broader review of mobility supports for persons with disabilities, would be undertaken. In this context I have been working with my Government colleague, Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. We are both agreed that the review should be brought within a wider review under the auspices of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, to examine transport supports encompassing all Government funded transport and mobility schemes for people with disabilities.  <\/p><p>This the most appropriate forum to meet mutual objectives in respect of transport solutions\/mobility supports for those with a disability.<\/p><p>The NDIS working group, chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte, with officials from both my Department and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as well as others, held its first meeting on the 26th January 2022. My officials will continue to work closely with officials from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to progress this review, and on foot of that will bring forward proposals for consideration.<\/p><p>Regarding the issue of whether the public can make a formal submission to the consultation process in relation to the primary medical certificates, the methods and structure of the NDIS working group is a matter for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. I cannot comment on any possible changes in advance of proposals arising from the review.<\/p><p>The number of applications for a Primary Medical Certificate and the number of those that were successful are a matter for the HSE.

The same tax applies to new vehicles and used imports alike.<\/p>  <p>  The Government is committed to incentivising electric vehicles (EVs) as has been reflected in the wide suite of measures which have facilitated an exponential growth in EV registrations over the past number of years. The Programme for Government 2020 outlined a commitment to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall greenhouse gas emissions from 2021 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade) and to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The need to make significant emissions reductions in the transport sector is fundamental to Ireland&rsquo;s policy around Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) and Motor Tax; the systems are designed to facilitate the uptake of EVs and to address the increasingly harmful environmental and public health effects of vehicle emissions.<\/p>  <p>  The VRT system has been modified in recent Budgets to strengthen the environmental rationale of the regime, and is structured to provide a reduced rate for EVs of 7% of open-market selling price (OMSP), while vehicles falling into the highest emissions band are liable to a rate of 41%. The &euro;5,000 VRT relief for electric cars and vans were due to end on 31st December 2021 but was extended for two years in Finance Act 2021 to end in 2023. As the rate of VRT charged for EVs is already very low, many purchased in the next two years will pay no VRT at all.<\/p>  <p>  In Finance Act 2019 I legislated for a carbon dioxide-based benefit-in-kind (BIK) regime for company cars from 1\/1\/2023. From that date the amount taxable as BIK remains determined by the car&rsquo;s original market value (OMV) and the annual business kilometres driven, while new carbon dioxide emissions-based bands will determine whether a standard, discounted, or surcharged rate is taxable. EVs will benefit from a preferential rate of BIK, ranging from 9 &ndash; 22% depending on mileage. Fossil-fuel vehicles will be subject to higher BIK rates, up to 37.5%. This new structure with carbon dioxide-based discounts and surcharges will incentivise employers to provide employees with low-emission cars.<\/p>  <p>  The current &euro;50,000 BIK exemption was extended in Finance Act 2021 with a tapering mechanism that represents a value for money consideration.  This forms part of a broader series of generous measures including the preferential rates of VRT and Motor Tax, the VRT relief, SEAI grants, discounted tolls fees, and 0% BIK on electric charging; all designed to achieve national targets around EV uptake. <\/p>  <p>  I am satisfied that this Government continues to provide a generous set of supports to achieve national targets regarding the transition to low and zero emission vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Data","counter":498,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK01100"},{"type":"question","counter":499,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[17685\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated cost to the Exchequer of reducing VAT on household energy bills, that is, gas, electricity and home heating oil to 9% and 13.5% from beginning of April 2022 to the end of August 2022 and to the end of December 2022, respectively.","asker":"1462","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":500,"content":"<p>I am advised by Revenue that traders are not required to identify the VAT yield generated from the supply of specific services on their VAT returns.

Broadly speaking, for the purpose of the margin scheme, second-hand goods are moveable goods which are suitable for use either as they are or after repair.  The VAT rate which applies to a sale of goods under the margin scheme is, with some exceptions, the same rate of VAT which is normally applicable to the particular good.

Employers may incur costs in excess of these limits, but any such excess will not qualify for the exemption and will be liable to tax. <\/p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be new and must be purchased by the employer.<\/p>  <p>  - The bicycle and related safety equipment must be used by the employee or director mainly for the whole or part of their journey to or from work.<\/p>  <p>  - An employee or director can only avail of the Cycle-to-Work scheme once in any 4 year period. A salary sacrifice arrangement is subject to the same time limits and any salary sacrifice arrangement entered into must be completed within a 12 month period.<\/p>  <p>  The Cycle-to-Work scheme is only applicable where the bicycle and safety equipment is provided by an employer to either a director or someone in its employment. Thus, where college are employed in a full or part time capacity and their employer is willing to participate in the Scheme, they may participate in the scheme.  However, where the employer-employee relationship does not exist, such individuals can&rsquo;t qualify for the scheme. <\/p>  <p>  The Cycle-to-Work scheme operates on a self-administration basis. Relief is automatically available provided the employer is satisfied that the conditions of its particular scheme meet the requirements of the legislation. There is no notification procedure for employers involved. This approach was taken with the deliberate intention of keeping the scheme simple and reducing administration on the part of employers.  Therefore, the cost of the existing scheme and of any potential changes can only be estimates.<\/p>  <p>  Further comprehensive guidance can be found on Revenue&rsquo;s website.<\/p>  <p>  While the scheme is kept under review by my officials, I have no plans at present for its expansion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Credit Unions","counter":528,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK04100"},{"type":"question","counter":529,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[18343\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500070#WRK04200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if there is an enhanced and more ambitious policy framework being planned or in discussion in relation to an issue (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1461","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":530,"content":"<p>This Government recognises the importance of credit unions.

In addition, the legal rights and terms and conditions of a customer&rsquo;s mortgage agreement, including in relation to the interest rate, remain in place following a loan sale\/transfer. <\/p>  <p>  It is also worth noting that under the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2018 if a loan is transferred or sold, the holder of the legal title to the credit must be regulated and must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to &lsquo;regulated financial service providers&rsquo;.  This ensures that consumers whose loans are sold or transferred, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had, including under the various Central Bank statutory Codes of Conduct, such as the Consumer Protection Code 2012 and the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 (CCMA).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has also advised that it&rsquo;s supervision of any bank that withdraws from the market will be focused on ensuring that its customers are treated fairly, that it remains in compliance with the letter and spirit of regulatory requirements.  The Central Bank has clearly communicated the requirement for a customer-focused approach to be taken in all aspects of their business throughout the period of change and that they ensure that customers understand what the withdrawal means for them. <\/p>  <p>  Within the regulatory and contractual framework as outlined above, it is a commercial matter for individual banks and other lenders to set their lending interest rates.

These expectations reflect the Central Bank's assessment of possible risks to consumers during periods of change and reinforce previously communicated expectations, based on it's experience of prior events.

The purpose of the REIT regime is to allow for a collective investment vehicle which provides a comparable after-tax return to investors as direct investment in rental property, by eliminating the double layer of taxation at corporate and shareholder level which would otherwise apply.<\/p><p>In order to ensure distribution of profits for taxation at the level of the shareholder, REITs are obliged to distribute at least 85% of property profits annually to shareholders.  REITs are obliged to operate Dividend Withholding Tax (DWT), at the standard rate of 25%, on distributions to shareholders. The DWT is available as a credit against the shareholder&rsquo;s tax liability.<\/p><p>For Irish investors:<\/p><p>- Individuals are liable to tax at their marginal rates on dividends received, with credit for the DWT deducted;<\/p><p>- Corporates will be liable to tax at 25%, with credit for DWT; and<\/p><p>- Institutional portfolio investors are liable to tax on REIT dividends at 12.5%, this being the rate generally applicable to trading income.<\/p><p>Foreign investors are also subject to the DWT at 25%. Those resident in treaty-partner countries may be able to reclaim some of this DWT under the relevant tax treaty.

If a REIT acquires an asset and following that acquisition, develops the asset to such an extent that the cost of development exceeds 30% of the market value of the asset at the time the development commenced, and the asset is then disposed of within 3 years of development, the corporation tax and capital gains tax exemptions will no longer apply.<\/p><p>- To prevent indefinite deferral of tax at the shareholder level, a REIT will be charged to corporation tax under Case IV of Schedule D if it distributes less than 85% of its annual property income. <\/p><p>- A REIT (or a group REIT) will also be charged to corporation tax under Case IV of Schedule D if it pays a dividend to a shareholder who holds more than 10% of its shares or if, in computing the profits available for distribution, it has taken a deduction for any amount which is not wholly and exclusively incurred for the purposes of:<\/p><p>- the property rental business, where it relates to the property rental business of the REIT, or<\/p><p>- the residual business where it relates to the residual business of the REIT. <\/p><p>I am informed by Revenue that gross REIT DWT collected in 2021 amounted to &euro;15,361,133.

The OPW has produced an individual FRMP for each of the 29 River Basins including the Shannon Upper &amp;amp; Lower River Basin. The focus of the reply to the Deputy&rsquo;s question is on the Shannon River Basin District.<\/p><p>The Government has committed &euro;1.3 billion to the delivery of flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2030 to protect approximately 23,000 properties in threatened communities from river and coastal flood risk. Since the launch of the FRMPs in 2018, as part of a phased approach to scheme delivery, this funding has allowed the OPW to treble to nearly 90 the number of schemes at design and construction at this time. <\/p><p>Today, work by the OPW is complete or underway to deliver protection to 80% of properties to be protected by this significant investment programme.<\/p><p>In the Shannon River Basin District, along with the 13 already completed schemes (see Appendix 1), a further 36 flood relief schemes will be delivered under the Government&rsquo;s &euro;1.3bn investment in flood relief measures over the lifetime of the NDP.<\/p><p>The OPW and the Local Authorities have been engaging pro-actively on the arrangements and structures to be put in place to advance the implementation of the Tranche 1 schemes. <\/p><p>Of the 24 Tranche 1 schemes currently being progressed (see Appendix 2), 2 schemes (Athlone and Springfield) are at construction. Engineering Consultants have been appointed for a further 13 schemes which are progressing through Stage 1 - Option Assessment, Scheme Development and Design including Kings Island which has received planning permission.  Construction is expected to commence in Q3 2022 with a completion date of approximately two years thereafter. <\/p><p>Work is ongoing to progress the other 9 schemes in the Shannon River Basin District.  8 of the schemes will be progressed directly by the relevant Local Authorities with full funding from the OPW.  The OPW is progressing the scheme for Rahan.<\/p><p>While the other 12 schemes recommended in the FRMPs have not yet commenced, it is planned that they will be underway in the lifetime of the NDP (see Appendix 3). <\/p><p>The Government has noted the study by the Shannon Flood Risk State Agency Co-ordination Working Group that supports a programme of strategic maintenance to help mitigate flooding along the River Shannon and a further study on the removal of a series of constrictions or &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; through the Shannon Callows that can help to delay flooding in the area. The Government has agreed that the OPW will provide &euro;7m for all of these works, of which &euro;4m relates to the removal of &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; through the Shannon Callows.  <\/p><p>Work is advancing to progress the project for the removal of the &lsquo;pinch points&rsquo; in the Shannon Callows between Athlone and Meelick Weir.  A Steering Group has been established to oversee this project and a brief has been developed for the appointment of a consultant to carry out the initial analysis and design work.  It is anticipated that the tendering process for this service will commence during Q2 2022.  Waterways Ireland, on behalf of the Shannon Group, will act as the Contracting Authority for this project.  <\/p><p>The works can only commence following the completion of the appropriate environmental assessments which are expected to be significant.  In addition, planning consent will be required to progress the project.  This is a time intensive process and there are a range of variables outside the control of the Shannon Group that may impact on the overall timescale for the delivery of this project. <\/p><p>Should the Deputy require any further information, the OPW will be glad to provide the specific details.<\/p><p><b>Appendix 1 Completed Flood Relief Schemes<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th colspan=\"2\">Completed Flood Relief Schemes <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>Sixmilebridge, Co.

Over the last number of weeks, the number of Ukrainian refugees arriving into Rosslare on ferry services from Cherbourg have been steadily rising from about 30 to around 200 at present. As a result of the increasing numbers, it was clear to the port authorities that new facilities were urgently required to provide for the care and comfort of refugees as they waited to be brought to suitable accommodation, while also meeting the needs of the various departments and agencies interacting with them on their arrival.  <\/p>  <p>  The Port authorities therefore obtained the agreement of the Revenue Commissioners to vacate, on a temporary basis, an area normally used by them to facilitate the location of a mobile hub &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; for the processing of Ukrainian refugees arriving into Ireland seeking safety and support. The Revenue Commissioners relocated their operation to their other facilities just outside the port at Kilrane. <\/p>  <p>  Following a request for assistance on 24th March from the Department of Transport, officials from the Office of Public Works immediately visited the site and identified an appropriate solution involving the installation of a large Marquee, a portacabin and toilet facilities. The installation of these units commenced on Sunday 27th of March and the works were completed last weekend. As a result, new arrivals, predominantly women and children, can now access suitable facilities at the port to meet with relevant officials from a number of organisations to quickly complete the immigration process and immediately apply for access to relevant services. The facility also contains an open lounge area with seating for 110 people, which will be manned by a humanitarian team. Refugees will be provided with food and drinks and can also access a storage area where they can select essential items such as clothes, sanitary items and toys for the children provided by charities and local communities before being brought to their assigned accommodation. In addition to the main space two adjacent tents are being managed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with vets available to examine any pets coming through. Toilets are also available just outside the marquee.<\/p>  <p>  These facilities will ensure that refugees can be provided with temporary protection and immediate access to essential services on arrival in a timely and efficient fashion with minimal delay after a long and arduous journey to reach Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The cost of the installation of this new infrastructure, including the initial month&rsquo;s rental payment, is &euro;165,000. The overall cost will depend on how long it is necessary to keep these units in place which is dependent on the flow of new arrivals at the port seeking international protection. While it is not possible to predict, with any degree of certainty, the likely numbers over the coming months, I can assure the Deputy that the government is fully committed to maintaining these services at the port for as long as they are needed.

Since the inscriptions of Hurling, my officials have met with both organisations on a number of occasions to discuss how best the Department can support them in safeguarding and raising awareness Hurling as an ICH practice. These discussions are ongoing and as with all elements on the Representative List, my Department is conscious that practitioners are the custodians of their practice and therefore safeguarding and transmission of same are led by the practitioners themselves.<\/p>  <p>  By achieving recognition of these practices on the UNESCO Representative List the practices are safeguarding for future generations. Inscriptions also serve to acknowledge and celebrate the work of the generations who have kept these traditions alive and provide a platform to highlight and share these cherished aspects of Irish culture with others. <\/p>  <p>  Earlier this year, Ireland submitted its periodic report to UNESCO to outline the legislative, regulatory and other measures undertaken for the safeguarding of ICH. The preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s report focused on the broad surveying of and engagement with relevant stakeholders including the GAA and The Camogie Association. The findings of the report will help inform and guide plans and priorities for ICH safeguarding over the coming years, while incorporating the Vision, Mission and Principles outlined for ICH in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  My Department also works closely with its Expert Advisory Committee to examine how it can most effectively work with ICH practitioners and existing agencies to raise awareness of and safeguard these practices for generations and looks forward to continuing to work with both the GAA and The Camogie Association in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding it should be noted that Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards. This includes the allocation of funding across a variety of funding schemes to the GAA and The Camogie Association.

This included the Section 28 Guidelines for Planning Authorities &ldquo;Regulation of Commercial Institutional Investment in Housing&rdquo; to planning authorities which aimed to prevent multiple units being sold to a single buyer. In addition a 10% stamp duty levy was introduced for the cumulative purchase of 10 or more residential houses in a 12 month period. This policy was aimed at ensuring a level playing field for traditional family home buyers, including but not limited to first-time buyers, while facilitating vital investment in high density apartments.  <\/p>  <p>  These Section 28 Guidelines aim to provide an &lsquo;owner-occupier&rsquo; guarantee by ensuring that new &lsquo;own-door&rsquo; houses and duplex units in housing developments can no longer be bulk-purchased by institutional investors in a manner that causes the displacement of individual purchasers or social and affordable housing, including cost-rental. <\/p>  <p> In addition, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Act 2021 (No. 40 of 2021) came into effect on 17 December 2021. Section 7 provides that the housing strategy prepared by a local authority shall take into account the need to ensure that home ownership as a tenure type is provided for and estimated in its housing strategy. This amendment supports the implementation of Housing Policy Objective 1.10 and introduces the principle of home ownership, as a specific tenure type within a local authority&rsquo;s housing strategy, with particular regard to developments comprising houses and duplexes and gives further legislative effect to the provisions of the Section 28 Guidelines issued in May 2021. <\/p>  <p>  Initial data indicates that this policy has been impactful. Industry analysis suggests that, with changes made in 2021 in relation to the bulk purchase of single family residential units, the proportion of such purchases fell from 11% of residential deals in 2020 to 2% in 2021.

Cost Rental schemes delivered by Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) and local authorities will target cost-covering rents of at least 25% below comparable open market rates.<\/p>  <p>  Under Housing for All, 10,000 Cost Rental homes will be delivered from 2021 to 2026 by AHBs, supported by Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding, along with funding for Local Authorities through the Affordable Housing Fund. The Land Development Agency will also deliver Cost Rental, either on its own portfolio of sites or through acquisitions under Project Tosaigh.<\/p>  <p>  A Housing Delivery Action Plan prepared by each Local Authority will underpin delivery of cost rental homes to 2026. Each local authority submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and my officials have now met with each and the final Delivery Action Plans are expected to be published in Q2.  <\/p>  <p>  To date, funding support has been provided to deliver almost 900 Cost Rental homes.  The first 65 Cost Rental homes were tenanted by the Cl&uacute;id AHB in 2021, with 25 at Taylor Hill in Balbriggan and a further 40 at Barnhall Meadows in Leixlip, with funding from the CREL scheme covering up to 30% of the capital costs in each of the two developments. Both developments also delivered cost-covering rents at least 40% below comparable open market prices.<\/p>  <p>  The tenanting process is currently underway for a further 44 new Cost Rental homes at the Parklands development in Citywest, also supported by CREL funding and being delivered by the Tuath AHB. Projected rents are &euro;1,264 per month for two-bedroom apartments and &euro;1,297 per month for two-bedroom duplexes. Tenants have been moving into a further 50 Cost Rental homes since the 14th of March 2022 at Enniskerry Road, Stepaside. These Cost Rental homes were delivered by the Tuath and Respond AHBs, in collaboration with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The cost-covering rent for these two-bedroom apartments is &euro;1,200 per month, which represents a very significant discount on market prices in the area (c. &euro;2,000).<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500072#WRM04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rental Sector","counter":667,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500072#WRM05000"},{"type":"question","counter":668,"qnumday":303,"qnumall":"[17531\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500072#WRM05100","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will report on the Housing for All extended rent pressure zones to 2024 and rents linked to the harmonised index of consumer prices.","asker":"1514","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":669,"content":"<p>The Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced measures in July 2021 to extend the operation of Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) until the end of 2024.

Through <i>Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland,<\/i>the Government&rsquo;s strategic housing plan to 2030, the Government is committed to taking action to prevent entries into homelessness in the first instance and to help those experiencing homelessness to exit into secure and sustained tenancies.  It also includes measures targeted specifically at those experiencing homelessness with complex needs. It commits to the continued expansion of the Housing First programme, and, importantly, ensuring that health and mental health supports are provided for homeless persons.<\/p><p>Under <i>Housing for All<\/i>, my Department has committed to actively participate through the newly established European Platform on Combatting Homelessness (EPOCH) to advance the Lisbon Declaration on Combatting Homelessness signed in June 2021. Under EPOCH, Ireland has committed to &ldquo;promote the prevention of homelessness, access to permanent housing and the provision of enabling support services to the homeless&rdquo;. <i>Housing for All <\/i>outlines how the Government will work towards ending homelessness by 2030, detailing 18 distinct actions tailored to achieve this target. This includes increasing access to supports for both individuals and families.<\/p><p>Ireland has committed to support EPOCH policy measures with adequate funding and, when appropriate, make use of EU funding as a lever to improve the way the EU address homelessness. Budget 2022 made provision for &euro;194 million in funding for homeless services. This funding in 2022 reflects the priority the Government is giving to homelessness. <\/p><p>Under EPOCH, Ireland has committed to share good practices in combatting homelessness. I recently attended a ministerial level meeting of EPOCH, whereby I discussed the most pressing issues in homelessness today with my European colleagues, and where the work programme of the Platform was adopted.<\/p><p>As provided for in <i>Housing for All<\/i>, the National Homeless Action Committee (NHAC) was established in Q4 2021. The first meeting took place in December 2021 and the second took place in February of this year. The work of NHAC is informed by <i>Housing for All<\/i>. The overarching objective of NHAC is to ensure that a renewed emphasis is brought to collaborating across Government to implement actions in the Plan, along with bringing better coherence and coordination of homeless-related services in delivering policy measures and actions to address homelessness. It is intended that meetings of NHAC will take place quarterly, with the third meeting due to be held in April. Details in respect of NHAC and a note of its meetings are published on my Department&rsquo;s website on an ongoing basis<\/p><p>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a Youth Homelessness Strategy and this is articulated in <i>Housing for All<\/i>. It was agreed at the first meeting of the NHAC that the development of this Strategy would be one of the first priorities of NHAC.  <\/p><p>The aim of this Strategy is to help young people who are aged 18 &ndash; 24 and who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.<\/p><p>A 3-week Public Consultation ran from 22 February and further consultations will take place in the next month. My Department, with the support of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, is also consulting directly with a number of key stakeholders. The Strategy is currently being developed and is intended for publication later this year.<\/p><p><i>Housing for All<\/i>also committed to the further expansion of Housing First. A new National Implementation Plan, which provides for a further 1,319 tenancies covering the period 2022-2026, was published in December 2021. The new Plan outlines the targets for each region and in each year.<\/p><p>The implementation of the Plan is a joint initiative of my Department, the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), the criminal justice sector (the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service) and Local Authorities, in conjunction with NGO partners. Each partner is committing the necessary resources and supports to implement the programme. A new Housing First Directorate has been established, and is based in the Housing Agency. The newly appointed Director is responsible for managing the implementation of the new Plan. <\/p><p>To aid in the further expansion of the Housing First approach, and in line with commitments made in <i>Housing for All<\/i>, it is planned to extend outreach and intensive engagement services to every region in the country ensuring that those most in need of the intense supports provided by Housing First will be able to avail of them.<\/p><p>To support this commitment The Housing Agency, in partnership with the HSE and in consultation with key Departments and agencies, is developing a good practice manual for the operation of assertive outreach services. This manual will assist regions in expanding outreach services into those urban areas in which rough sleeping is understood to be a concern. This manual is to be published by mid-2022.<\/p><p>Resources are being made available to expand outreach services.

The Fresh Start principle extends the supports available under both Affordable Purchase schemes and the Local Authority Home Loan scheme to applicants who are divorced, legally separated, or where the relationship has ended and where they retain no beneficial interest in a home. The Fresh Start principle will also apply to those who have previously purchased a residential property but have been divested of this through personal insolvency or bankruptcy arrangements, proceedings or other legal processes.<\/p><p>Specifically in relation to the Local Authority Affordable Purchase scheme, the Fresh Start principle has already been accommodated under Part 2, Section 10 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021. This scheme assists first-time buyers (as well as those eligible under the Fresh Start principle) purchasing Local Authority-delivered new homes by bridging the gap between the market value of the home and the combined value of the buyer's mortgage and deposit. Regulations setting out the detailed eligibility criteria for the scheme are at an advanced stage and will be issued in the coming weeks.<\/p><p>Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021 provides for the establishment of the First Home scheme, which will act in a similar way to the Local Authority-led scheme, though it will apply to homes purchased through the private market. Under both schemes, an equity stake corresponding to the level of support provided is taken in the market value of the home. The supported home-owner will have an option to achieve full ownership by buying-out the equity stake in the purchased property at a timing of their own discretion. An equity buy-out will be required in circumstances where the home is sold or passed on, or ceases to the primary residential residence. <\/p><p>The First Home scheme will be available at a national level and will incorporate regional price caps reflecting median house price sales. Confirmation of the final details of this scheme is ongoing in conjunction with the relevant stakeholders and it is anticipated that the First Home scheme will be available for applications, including those eligible under the Fresh Start principle, in the second half of this year. This initiative is being designed to ensure support is provided to those that, because of the current income levels, cannot secure a sufficient mortgage to meet the cost of a modest newly constructed home in their preferred location.<\/p><p>The Local Authority Home Loan is a Government backed mortgage scheme for those on modest or low incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial banks to purchase or build a home. It has been available nationwide from local authorities since 4 January 2022 for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants. The loan can be used both for new and second-hand properties, or to self-build.<\/p><p>The &lsquo;Fresh Start&rsquo; principle applies for applications to State loan schemes such as the Local Authority Home Loan. The following categories of persons are eligible to apply for the Local Authority Home Loan under the Fresh Start principle:<\/p><p>- Applicant(s) that previously purchased or built a residential property, but is divorced and has left the property and divested themselves of their interest in the property are eligible. <\/p><p>- Applicant(s) that previously purchased a residential property, but have been divested of this through insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, are eligible to apply. The applicant must be discharged from bankruptcy proceedings.

The Residential Zoned Land Tax was introduced by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act 2021. The purpose of the proposed measure is to incentivise the activation of land which is zoned and serviced for residential development, but remains undeveloped. It is primarily intended to influence behaviour towards increased housing output, rather than to raise revenue. The tax will replace the Vacant Site Levy. <\/p>  <p>  The significant benefit of the tax is to incentivise the development of suitably zoned land across the State which has been the beneficiary of costly investment in servicing for housing construction. This includes lands in cities, towns and village centres which are vacant or idle where zoned for mixed use including residential. The tax measure, in conjunction with the ongoing review of development plans throughout the state to identify and zone housing land needed to meet statutory Housing Supply Targets will ensure that delivery of housing on zoned and serviced land is progressed. The tax will, when it comes into effect in 2024, be applied at an annual taxation rate of 3% of market value of the land to encourage use for appropriate development.  <\/p>  <p>  The tax will apply to all land zoned for residential or a mix of uses including residential and which are serviced throughout all 31 local authorities, with certain lands excluded from scope, as set out within the legislation. The role of the local authorities is to identify the lands in scope via a mapping process commencing November 2022, which includes appeal provisions where the relevant landowner considers that a parcel of land does not meet the criteria for falling within the scope of the tax.  <\/p>  <p>  The tax will be managed by the Revenue Commissioners. After the publication of the final maps in December 2023, the maps will be reviewed annually by local authorities to ensure they are up to date. The tax will remain as a charge on the land, will be applied annually and will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners, incentivising the development of the land-bank by the owners, or the sale of the land to those who will undertake development.  <\/p>  <p>  Existing dwellings and their gardens, while they will be included in the maps, are not included in the scope of the tax.  <\/p>  <p>  Landowners may also make submissions to local authorities during the public consultation periods on the maps in 2022\/23 only to amend zonings to remove their lands from the scope of the tax. In considering these submissions and the potential for varying the adopted development plan as a result, the local authorities must take into account the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and the need to zone sufficient land to meet the statutory Housing Supply Targets.  <\/p>  <p>  My Department notified all local authorities of the introduction of the tax measure on signing of the Finance Act 2021. My Department is preparing guidance on the mapping process and the management of rezoning requests and will liaise with stakeholders through a working group.  Financial support and assistance to the local authorities will also be provided on this matter to ensure that the maps will be published as required by the legislation. My Department will bring forward separate transitionary legislation to repeal the vacant site levy arrangements and this will take account of lands that might otherwise fall out of the full scope of the Vacant Site Levy, that are currently subject to the Vacant Site Levy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500073#WRN03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":724,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500073#WRN03700"},{"type":"question","counter":725,"qnumday":321,"qnumall":"[17552\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500073#WRN03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if he will report on the Housing for All for a new cro&iacute; c&oacute;naithe fund to increase owner-occupier apartment development in city centres.","asker":"1514","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":726,"content":"<p>The national housing policy <i>Housing for All, as <\/i>launched in September 2021, provides a new pathway to a sustainable housing system, by clearly setting out how we plan to address the short, medium and long-term challenges ahead.

One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF). <\/p><p>CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction, acquisition or refurbishment of new social housing units.  This loan facility can support up to 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the housing units provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.  <\/p><p>With regard to the specific project to which the Question refers, I can confirm that the project received conditional CALF funding approval in 2018.

This will include the introduction and full implementation of a pipeline of cost reducing innovations and productivity measures, in line with its established remit to improve productivity and efficiency, and to temper price inflation.<\/p>  <p>  In addition the CSG supported by my Department are also in the process of preparing a study to carry out an analysis for each component of cost of construction (including cost of compliance) of house and apartment development, with a view to reducing cost (including cost of compliance) and increasing standardisation.

Together these two schemes will support the purchase of 36,000 affordable homes under the Government's <i>Housing for All<\/i>strategy.<\/p><p>Both of these schemes will use an equity support model to assist eligible purchasers. In the case of Local Authority Affordable Purchase, this equity stake will be equivalent to the reduction in price from the full market value of the home and will be held by the Local Authority. In the case of the national First Home Scheme, the equity stake will be the funding provided to bridge the gap between someone's maximum mortgage under the Central Bank Mortgage Measures and the price of a new home (within regional price ceilings reflective of median first-time buyer prices). Subject to final approvals, equity under the First Home Scheme is to be funded by the State and participating mortgage providers on a 50:50 basis and will be held by a Special Purpose Vehicle (the First Home Scheme Ireland DAC). <\/p><p>For both schemes contractual arrangements will be put in place between the equity holder, be it a local authority or the First Home scheme, and the purchaser. These contracts will fully detail the rights and responsibilities of the signatories and will contain the necessary covenants to fully protect the State&rsquo;s interest. <\/p><p>The State&rsquo;s interest will be registrable as a beneficial interest in the Land Registry as an act of the homeowner affecting the dwelling. Under both schemes, the purchaser of the home can redeem or &lsquo;buy out&rsquo; this equity stake, in full or in part, at a time of their choosing. Since the equity stake will be redeemed at the current market price of the home, there is potential for its value to both rise and fall, though over the long term it is expected that market prices will rise. This brings both risk and benefit for the holder of the equity, but the potential risk is proportionate to the size of the equity stake in the home, and in the case of the jointly funded First Home Scheme the risk is shared 50:50 by the State and participating mortgage lenders.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500076#WRQ01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Housing Provision","counter":897,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500076#WRQ01200"},{"type":"question","counter":898,"qnumday":383,"qnumall":"[18241\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500076#WRQ01300","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of new build social housing homes that were delivered in 2021; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1550","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":899,"content":"<p>My Department publishes comprehensive programme level statistics on social housing delivery for each local authority on a quarterly basis.

On 9 March, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a disbursement of US$1.4 billion under the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to help Ukraine meet urgent financing needs and mitigate the economic impact of the war. This follows a US$723 million package of support approved by the World Bank; a &euro;668 million immediate financial support package for Ukraine to be provided by the EIB; and a &euro;2 billion &lsquo;resilience package&rsquo; approved by the EBRD.<\/p>  <p>  In the absence of full funding by bilateral donors, debt cancellation or debt forgiveness by the IMF risks impairing the Fund's financial integrity which, in turn, could jeopardise future financing for Ukraine and other countries in need. Instead, the IMF&rsquo;s ability to provide debt service relief on its loans to members must be underpinned by donor grants for the repayment of those loans.  For example, during the COVID-19 crisis, the IMF used the donor-supported Catastrophe and Containment Relief Trust to provide debt relief totalling almost US$1 billion to cover debt obligations owed to the Fund between April 2020 and April 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland remains steadfast and unwavering in its support to Ukraine, including through provision of humanitarian aid, the European Peace Facility package for Ukraine, and the EU's emergency macro-financial assistance operation of &euro;1.2 billion in the form of loans to foster stability in Ukraine.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1013,"content":"<p>Question No. 420 answered with Question No. 415.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Meetings","counter":1014,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR05900"},{"type":"question","counter":1015,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[18270\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06000","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if he has had any engagement regrading a matter (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1016,"content":"<p>Respect for human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, and we have made this position clear to the Singaporean authorities. The Embassy of Ireland in Singapore, together with our European Union partners has actively monitored the case of Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, including calling on the authorities to halt his execution and to commute his sentence to a non-capital sentence.  We learned with grave concern that Mr. Dharmalingam's death sentence has been upheld by the courts in Singapore on 29 March.  On 30 March, a spokesperson for the EU's High Representative also issued a statement deeply regretting the execution in Singapore of Abdul Kahar bin Othman, who was the first person to executed in Singapore since 2019.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is unequivocal in its stance against the death penalty and the abolition of capital punishment is one of Ireland&rsquo;s international priorities. My Department regularly conveys our stance on this matter to all countries where the death penalty is still in use. Our active participation at the United Nations Human Rights Council is a particularly important fora in which to raise our concerns regarding human rights. At the 48th Session of the Council, Ireland, as part of the EU27, co-sponsored the biennial resolution on the question of the death penalty which was adopted by vote. The resolution calls on those States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to ensure transparency and respect for human rights. In our intervention at the last Universal Periodic Review of Singapore's human rights record in May 2021 Ireland called on Singapore to consider a moratorium on executions as a step towards abolition.<\/p>  <p>  I remain deeply concerned about the use of the death penalty and Ireland will continue to monitor developments in Singapore in this regard.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06100","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Foreign Birth Registration","counter":1017,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06200"},{"type":"question","counter":1018,"qnumday":422,"qnumall":"[18271\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the number of full, part-time and casual staff processing applications for the foreign births register monthly from January 2020 to date in tabular form.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1019,"qnumday":423,"qnumall":"[18272\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of the scaling-up operations in regard to applications to the foreign births register; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":1020,"qnumday":424,"qnumall":"[18273\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500077#WRR06500","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the month in which the foreign birth register applications currently being worked on were received; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1498","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1021,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 to 424, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is responsible for citizenship by descent through the Foreign Births Register under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.<\/p>  <p>  Before the onset of Covid-19, 18 staff were assigned to Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) entitlement checking. Due to the pandemic, from March 2020, FBR staff were redeployed to assist in the delivery of essential services, which resulted in a pause in overall FBR processing for a total of 15 months across the 2020-2021 period. Despite this pause, 12,000 FBR applications were processed in 2020, and 7,000 applications were processed in 2021 as FBR staff continued to provide an emergency service for Foreign Birth Registration in cases of exceptional urgency, such as expectant parents, or stateless persons.<\/p>  <p>  Given the redeployment of staff from the FBR team to passport checking and other essential services during the pandemic the Passport Service does not have a monthly record of the numbers of staff assigned to FBR entitlement checking during that period.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the FBR Service in November 2021, there have been 17 staff assigned to FBR entitlement checking.

Due to the complex nature of the FBR process, the large increase in applications received following the Brexit vote in the UK, and the pause in the service due to necessary Covid-19 restrictions, applicants should allow over 2 years from the receipt of supporting documentation for processing of FBR applications at this time.

Costs detailed below relate to Defence Forces attendance at training and other activities that ensure that the Defence Forces can operate safely and effectively in crisis management operations and for some services, including secure comms and Role 2 medical facilities in KFOR.<\/p><p>The total value of expenditure from the Department of Defence to NATO institutions in 2019, 2020 and 2021 is as follows: <table>    <tr>       <th>SUPPLIER -  NATO INSTITUTION <\/th>       <th>2019 <\/th>       <th>2020 <\/th>       <th>2021 <\/th>       <th>TOTAL <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NATO COOPERATIVE CYBER DEFENCE CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>500 <\/td>       <td>500 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NATO MARITIME INTERDICTION OPERATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>11,000 <\/td>       <td>11,000 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NATO SCHOOL OBERAMMERGAU SHAPE <\/td>       <td>7,800 <\/td>       <td>24,400 <\/td>       <td>18,850 <\/td>       <td>51,050 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>BICES GROUP EXECUTIVE <\/td>       <td>164,935 <\/td>       <td>125,393 <\/td>       <td>142,651 <\/td>       <td>432,979 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NATO SUPPORT AGENCY   for Role 2 Medical Facilities for personnel deployed in KFOR<\/td>       <td>206 <\/td>       <td>0 <\/td>       <td>6,003 <\/td>       <td>6,209 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TOTALS <\/td>       <td>172,941 <\/td>       <td>149,793 <\/td>       <td>179,005 <\/td>       <td>501,739 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p>The above costs do not include reimbursement to the Department of Foreign Affairs for office and accommodation costs in respect of the PfP Liaison Office in Brussels.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Traffic Management","counter":1061,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1062,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[18178\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS03900","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"if he will liaise with officials in his Department regarding granting access to a location for a person (details supplied).; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1495","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1063,"content":"<p>In light of the reported concerns of An Garda Siochana in relation to potential impacts on traffic management arising from the intended building works, I have instructed my officials to engage further with the requestor to ascertain how best this matter can be resolved.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Flexible Work Practices","counter":1064,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS04100"},{"type":"question","counter":1065,"qnumday":443,"qnumall":"[18161\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500078#WRS04200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the current policy with respect to remote working options for staff in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":1066,"content":"<p>Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, my  Department, in line with other civil and public service organisations, has adhered to public health advice and to the Guidance for Public Service Employers published by the  Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

Successful and repeatable results are then incorporated into all new school designs and refurbishments through my Department&rsquo;s Technical Guidance Documents, which set the benchmark for sustainable design in school buildings with a clear focus on energy efficiency. The Department&rsquo;s policy is supported by a strong research programme with fifty three research projects at various stages including the energy website www.energyineducation.ie. which is a joint partnership with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).<\/p><p>Schools designed and built in accordance with the Department&rsquo;s schools technical guidance documents have been achieving A3 Building Energy Ratings since 2009 with schools typically achieving up to 20% higher performance than required by the current Building Regulations, along with 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics and infrastructure provision for electric vehicle charging. <\/p><p>These new schools include: <\/p><p>- A3 BER standard <\/p><p>- Fully evaluated natural ventilation strategy to all spaces<\/p><p>- 20% higher energy performance and 25% better carbon performance than required by the 2019 Building Regulations even thought it was designed pre 2019<\/p><p>- 10% of primary energy provided via photovoltaics<\/p><p>-Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable biomass heat to the school under the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat (SSRH), as the heat as a service area matures in Ireland.

It is also critical that an energy reduction plan is part of any investment in renewable energy applications. <\/p><p>The Department&rsquo;s approach is also based on future proofing to ensure school buildings are renewable compatible and are able to take advantage of developing technologies as they become viable, thus enabling a just transition for school management, teachers, pupils and parents to include:<\/p><p>- Direct modulating high efficiency gas boiler systems that can support the integration of heat pump systems, in series at a base level, with controls.<\/p><p>- Optimum envelope fabric that will not require additional enhancement for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems, (note further enhancement of the external building fabric will result in overheating in Spring and Autumn, requiring air conditioning).<\/p><p>- Low water content radiators and operating temperatures for compatibility with decarbonised heating systems.  <\/p><p>- Provision to enable Energy Supply Companies (ESCO's) to sell renewable heat to schools using biomass boilers, with provision for the ESCO to provide, operate and maintain the boiler plant system and maximise the Support Scheme for Renewable Heat.<\/p><p>The Department have been using test schools to evaluate the suitability of renewable energy options for schools over the past twenty plus years. Nearly 60 % of the research programme features renewable aspects. These renewables include wind generation, solar hot water heating, photovoltaics, rain water recovery, geothermal heat pumps, air source heat pumps and biomass heating systems. Results have varied with respect to their applicability in a school environment.  Research continues in many areas. <\/p><p>My Department and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications established a jointly funded pathfinder programme with the SEAI, testing and demonstrating energy efficiency and decarbonisation retrofit approaches. This pathfinder is a great example of collaboration ensuring the deployment of new design approaches and technologies are introduced to the educational environment on an evidence based approach. <\/p><p>This Pathfinder programme is paving the way for, and informing, a much larger national schools&rsquo; programme for the energy retrofit of schools built prior to 2008 as included in the National Development Plan. It is facilitating research on a range of typical retrofit options, which will have been tried and tested. It is providing valuable development information for a solution driven delivery strategy which will be founded on a solid evidence base that has proven the robustness and scalability of renewable solutions within the schools&rsquo; sector.<\/p><p>The Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are involved in an energy efficient retrofit pathfinder scheme for schools since 2017. The longer-term outcome of the pathfinder will be to create an accurate and scalable model for energy efficient retrofits of schools across Ireland. A deep energy retrofit programme for schools built prior to 2008 is due to be rolled out as included in the National Development Plan.  <\/p><p>The pathfinder programme has retrofitted 41 schools across Ireland to date with work on an additional 9 schools added in 2021 underway. 2022 sees six additional schools undergoing deep retrofit to a Building Energy Rating (BER) of B with renewable heating systems. Each school undergoes a comprehensive assessment to ensure that the measures are suitable for that school and will deliver value to both the school and learnings for the national retrofit programme. <\/p><p>The pathfinder programme builds on significant investment by the Department of Education in energy efficiency through the 2009\/10 Cavity and Attic Insulation\/Water Conservation Scheme and ongoing Summer Works and refurbishment projects. <\/p><p>The schools for the 2022 programme are:<\/p><p>- Ennis Community College<\/p><p>- Bishopstown Community School <\/p><p>- St Marys Secondary School Killester <\/p><p>- Our Lady of Consolation Killester <\/p><p>- Scoil Mhuire NS Abbeyleix  <\/p><p>- St Annes Primary school, Tallaght<\/p><p>The upgrades target a Building Energy Rating of B, 50% energy efficiency improvement and 51% emissions reduction. The works typically involves upgrades to the building fabric including wall and roof insulation, doors and windows, air tightness improvements, LED lighting and heating upgrades as well as renewable technologies. <\/p><p>The Department recognises that transition to full decarbonisation raises the bar even higher in terms of requirements with feedback from our pathfinder projects as noted above indicating a greater depth of challenges at a significantly enhanced cost for primary and post primary schools. <\/p><p>The Climate Action Plan 2021 Annex of Actions published in January this year actions the Department to confirm its decarbonisation pathway trajectory to meet 2030 and 2050 targets for the schools sector by end of 2022.<\/p><p>Work is ongoing on decarbonisation options for new schools with a focus on the standard of required design criteria and specification to achieve a net zero energy school building and establishing the trajectory for the integration of suitable solutions on a phased basis in a risk controlled manner providing a credible cost effective transition to zero carbon school buildings while ensuring no delays to school accommodation delivery.<\/p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the education sector will receive a total of approximately &euro;4.4 billion capital investment over the period 2021-2025. This significant investment allows us to move forward with certainty on our ambitious plans and deliver high quality building projects, with a real focus on sustainability, for school communities across Ireland. This investment will also build on the good progress being made on adding capacity to cater for demographic changes and provision for children with special educational needs. This investment will also facilitate an increased focus on the modernisation of existing school stock and help transition the school system for an era of net zero carbon by 2050.<\/p><p>The total budget for the Pathfinder programme of works from 2017 - 2022 is &euro;78m.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1101,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1102,"qnumday":456,"qnumall":"[17579\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT02000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the status of a building project (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1619","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1103,"content":"<p>As the Deputy is aware, this project has been devolved for delivery to Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board (WWETB).  <\/p><p>I can confirm that the Design Team to deliver this project was appointed by WWETB in April 2021.

The Department does not believe that the existing minimum qualifications has impacted on the calibre of person appointed and it is also the case that people with experience and\/or higher qualifications than the minimum are often the successful candidate in competitions held by schools.<\/p>  <p>  However, having considered the claim and, in particular, the period of time since they were set, the Department is open to reviewing the position. The Department is not yet in a position to indicate when that review might take place but is of the view that the forthcoming review of the SNA contract proposed as part of the Building Momentum national pay agreement should be carried out and implemented first.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is satisfied that the approach outlined fully recognises the important place of SNAs in our schools.  The forthcoming review of the SNA contract along with the new training programme for SNAs that is now in place will help to enhance the experience of children with special needs in our schools.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":1146,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06400"},{"type":"question","counter":1147,"qnumday":471,"qnumall":"[17749\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the total cost incurred each year by her Department for the running of the leaving certificate helpline in 2020 and in 2021.","asker":"1460","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1148,"content":"<p>I can confirm to the Deputy that my Department provided &euro;12,000 in 2020 and &euro;20,000 in 2021 towards the running of the Leaving Certificate Helpline.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Building Projects","counter":1149,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06700"},{"type":"question","counter":1150,"qnumday":472,"qnumall":"[17818\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500079#WRT06800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the commencement date for phase two of a school development (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1566","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1151,"content":"<p>The school to which the deputy refers received approval for a School Development Phase 2 in May 2020 under the Additional Accommodation Scheme 2020.

As a result, the establishment of the planned new school has been deferred. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Management","counter":1179,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1180,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[17979\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU02900","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of appeals made to her Department under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 in 2020 and 2021, respectively; the number of these appeals that were upheld and the number that were denied in these respective years; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1181,"content":"<p>The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the table hereunder. <\/p><p>Section 29 of the Education  Act 1998 provided that the outcome for appeals lodged prior to 12th November 2020 to be upheld, upheld in part or not upheld.<\/p><p>Section 7 of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018  which commenced from 12th November 2020  provides for a section 29 Appeals hearing committee to allow, disallow or refuse to determine an appeal.<\/p><p>In all appeals it is open to the appellant to withdraw their appeal prior to the hearing, should they so wish.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU03000","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs","counter":1182,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU03100"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[17980\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU03200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the primary and secondary special schools recognised by her Department in counties Cork and Waterford; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1515","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1184,"content":"<p>Special schools funded by my Department are classified as primary national schools and are intended to cater for children and young persons with special educational needs from the age of 4 years until the end of the school year in which they reach their 18th year.<\/p>  <p>  A list of all special schools in the country, including those in the counties referenced by the Deputy, are available on the NCSE website at the following link: ncse.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/NCSE-Teaching-SNA-Allocation-Special-Schools-20.21-12.06.2020.1.pdf<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1472"},{"type":"question","counter":1186,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[17981\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500080#WRU03500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools that provided July provision for the past five years, by county; and the number of schools that propose to facilitate July provision in 2022, by county, in tabular form; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1605","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":1187,"content":"<p>The purpose of the July Provision Scheme was to provide an extended school year for children with a severe or profound general learning disability or children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).  The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special education needs over the summer holidays.  With regard to the range of years referred to by the Deputy, Special schools and schools with special classes were permitted to run the school-based programme over the years 2017-2020 inclusive. <\/p><p>In 2020 a significantly expanded summer programme was established as a response to COVID-19 with the eligibility criteria widened to include approximately 9,000 additional children with complex needs. <\/p><p>The programme aims were to ensure, in so far as possible, that these children could reintegrate\/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  As part of this expansion, the Department&rsquo;s existing Literacy and Numeracy camps for DEIS Primary Band 1 schools was included in the Summer Programme and extended to all DEIS Primary schools. Furthermore, DEIS post-primary schools were given the option of running an inclusion programme for the first time.  <\/p><p>In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the government announced a further expanded to the Summer Programme.  Under this expansion, students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage had access to an enhanced summer programme of education. The total funding available to provide the programme was &euro;40 million, which was a 100% increase on the allocation for summer provision in 2020.  The range of programmes on offer built on the success of the expanded programmes that ran in 2020 and incorporated feedback from education stakeholders.  For the first time, all primary schools were given the opportunity to run a 2-3 week inclusion programme, an expansion to all post-primary schools that had been previously only been available in DEIS post-primary schools in 2020.  In addition, enhanced supports provided included measures to reduce the administrative burden, provision of funding to schools towards preparation and overseeing of the programmes, earlier payment to school staff and provision to recruit newly qualified teachers to work on the programme. <\/p><p>My Department is currently at an advanced stage of planning for the 2022 summer programme. Details of the programme will published as soon as possible.<\/p><p>Due to the different structures of July Provision and the Summer Programme, the information as requested by the Deputy is broken down to cover the years 2017-2020 and 2021 for the primary and post primary programmes,  as well as a separate breakdown of the DEIS Literacy and Numeracy\/Campai Samhraidh over the period 2017-2021.<\/p><p><b><i>1. 2017-2020 <\/i><\/b><\/p><p>1a Schools offering the Special Class and Special School Programme <table>    <tr>       <th>County<\/th>       <th>2017<\/th>       <th>2018<\/th>       <th>2019<\/th>       <th>2020<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Carlow<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cavan<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Clare<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Cork<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>26<\/td>       <td>27<\/td>       <td>31<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Donegal<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Dublin<\/td>       <td>41<\/td>       <td>44<\/td>       <td>38<\/td>       <td>49<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Galway<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>21<\/td>       <td>22<\/td>       <td>19<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kerry<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kildare<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>20<\/td>       <td>17<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Kilkenny<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Laois<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Limerick<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Longford<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Louth<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mayo<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Meath<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Monaghan<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Offaly<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Roscommon<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Sligo<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Tipperary<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>       <td>10<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Waterford<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Westmeath<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>       <td>8<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wexford<\/td>       <td>13<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>15<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Wicklow<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Yearly   Totals<\/td>       <td>219<\/td>       <td>239<\/td>       <td>232<\/td>       <td>254<br \/><br \/><\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>1b 2020 &ndash;

The model applies to pupils with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes only and provides many advantages for both the school and the pupils.  A diagnosis of a disability is not required in order to access additional teaching support.  This approach is pupil cantered and schools are expected to ensure that the pupils with the greatest level of need receive the most support. A school can seek a review of its SET or SNA allocation where it considers that the allocation is not sufficient to meet its needs.The Special Education Teaching (SET) allocation provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.

The numbers of special classes, special education teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are at unprecedented levels.<\/p>  <p>  Very significant levels of financial provision are made to ensure that children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs. <\/p>  <p>  The State currently spends in excess of 25% of its annual education and training budget (&euro;9.2 Billion) on making additional provision for children with special educational needs.<\/p>  <p>  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011, at which point &euro;1.247 Billion per annum was provided.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased by almost 386% from 548 to 2,118 for the 2021\/2022 school year.  Of these 1,524 special classes are in primary schools. <\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 announced details of &euro;9.2 billion in funding for education and includes funding for an additional 1,165 SNAs (in 2022) to provide support to children with special educational needs, which will bring the total number of SNAs to 19,169 at the end of December 2022. This represents an increase of 81% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,575 SNAs were available.<\/p>  <p>  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs.  Such support is provided in order to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and also to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned, or for their peers, and with a view to developing their independent living skills.<\/p>  <p>  SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management of the school.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. <\/p>  <p>  There are now over 13,600 Special Education Teachers allocated to mainstream primary and post primary schools.  <\/p>  <p>  This represents an increase of 40% in the total number of special education teachers allocated to schools since 2011, at which time 9,740 teachers were allocated.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2022 provides for the creation 980 new teaching posts in special education.  This new investment is required to meet the needs of students with special educational needs enrolled in mainstream classes; students to be enrolled in new special classes and new special school places and the needs of new and developing schools. <\/p>  <p>  The new allocation is broken down as follows:<\/p>  <p>  - 620 of the new posts will provide additional support for children attending mainstream classes including new and  expanding schools<\/p>  <p>  - 360 posts will facilitate the opening of 287 new special classes providing over 1,700 new places in 2022 and 140 new special school places<\/p>  <p>  A new model for allocating special education teachers in respect of students with special needs enrolled in mainstream classes was introduced in 2017.  The Special Education Teacher allocation process provides a single unified allocation for special educational support teaching needs to each school, based on each school&rsquo;s educational profile.  The profile of each school takes account of enrolments and a number of other factors that are considered to be indicative of the level of need in each school. There is a commitment to update profiles on a regular basis with the last update being for the 2019\/20 school. <\/p>  <p>  In addition, there is a provision for schools to seek additionality through the Exceptional Needs Review process if there is a significant change in their level of need in between profile updates.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. It has well established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents. NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special education placements.<\/p>  <p>  Where circumstances change during the course of the 2021\/22 school year that materially increase the level of care need in a school to the extent that the school can clearly demonstrate that it cannot be met within the existing SNA allocation, the school may apply to the NCSE for a review.

There are currently approximately 1,025,000 customers with direct eligibility.

Further meetings will be arranged once this exploratory work has been concluded.<\/p><p>However, it is really important to note that, in general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Crucially as many illnesses or physical conditions have an impact across a spectrum from mild to severe, entitlement to these schemes is not provided on the basis of a simple diagnosis but on the basis of the impact of that diagnosis on the individual concerned.  In this way resources can be targeted to people with most need.  Therefore, while a diagnosis of a particular medical condition will be required to establish if a person may be eligible for certain social welfare schemes, evidence of impact is also required before entitlement to the scheme or the related free travel scheme is established.  The sole exception to this general approach is in respect of people who are blind.<\/p><p>It is also important to note that there are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to a person with any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act. <\/p><p>While consideration is always given to any requests to improve or extend eligibility to the free travel scheme, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from being a social welfare measure to being a general transport initiative.<\/p><p>Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant. The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.

For example, class D contributors currently pay a contribution at the rate of 0.9% on their weekly earnings up to &euro;1,443 and 4% on weekly earnings over that amount and their employers pay a contribution of 2.35% on all employee earnings.  Class D contributors are currently entitled to widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's (contributory) pension, guardian's payment (contributory), occupational injuries benefits, parent's benefit and carer's benefit.<\/p>  <p>  In contrast, civil and public servants recruited from 6 April 1995 pay a class A social insurance contribution of 4% on their weekly earnings and their employers pay a contribution of 8.8% where employees&rsquo; weekly earnings are &euro;410 or less and 11.05% where their employees&rsquo; weekly earnings exceed &euro;410.  Class A contributors have access to the full range of social insurance benefits.<\/p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500081#WRV05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Community Welfare Services","counter":1274,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500081#WRV05700"},{"type":"question","counter":1275,"qnumday":515,"qnumall":"[17489\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500081#WRV05800","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the number of persons who met with the community welfare officer in person at locations (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1590","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1276,"content":"<p>My Department does not maintain records of the number of persons who meet with the Community Welfare Officers (CWOs) in Intreo Centres and Outreach locations.<\/p><p>The following tables show:<\/p><p>-  the number of Basic weekly Supplementary Welfare Allowance (SWA) in payment in December 2019, 2020 and 2021 in the locations concerned. <\/p><p>-  the number of SWA supplements (including Rent Supplement, Diet Supplement and Travel Supplement) in payment in December 2019, 2020 and 2021 in the locations concerned and <\/p><p>-  the number of Exceptional Needs Payment awarded and paid during 2019, 2020 and 2021 in the locations concerned. <\/p><p>It should be noted that in Quarter 4, 2021, the claimload in Mountmellick was reallocated to CWOs in adjacent areas to maximise efficiencies in claim processing. <\/p><p>The data beneath will give an indication of the level of traffic to the Community Welfare Service in Portlaoise, Rathdowney and Mountmellick in December  in the years 2019, 2020 and 2021: <table>    <tr>       <th>Basic SWA claims in payment <\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>       <th><\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Location <\/td>       <td>Dec-19 <\/td>       <td>Dec-20 <\/td>       <td>Dec-21 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise <\/td>       <td>303 <\/td>       <td>193 <\/td>       <td>184 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Rathdowney <\/td>       <td>71 <\/td>       <td>54 <\/td>       <td>48 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountmellick <\/td>       <td>42 <\/td>       <td>24 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SWA Supplements claims in payment <\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Location <\/td>       <td>Dec-19 <\/td>       <td>Dec-20 <\/td>       <td>Dec-21 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Portlaoise <\/td>       <td>148 <\/td>       <td>159 <\/td>       <td>92 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Rathdowney <\/td>       <td>23 <\/td>       <td>31 <\/td>       <td>30 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Mountmellick <\/td>       <td>28 <\/td>       <td>21 <\/td>       <td>1 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p><p><b>Exceptional Needs Payments made<\/b> <table>    <tr>       <th>Year <\/th>       <th>Portlaoise <\/th>       <th>Rathdowney <\/th>       <th>Mountmellick <\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2019 <\/td>       <td>2,269 <\/td>       <td>432 <\/td>       <td>305 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2020 <\/td>       <td>1,650 <\/td>       <td>231 <\/td>       <td>171 <\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>2021 <\/td>       <td>1,119 <\/td>       <td>166 <\/td>       <td>98 <\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> A person can request an appointment with a Community Welfare Officer (CWO) at my Department's office at Government Buildings, Abbeyleix Road, Portlaoise Monday to Friday and at the Social Welfare Branch Office in Rathdowney each Thursday morning.

In addition to these primary payments, my Department also provides a range of other payments, both cash and non-cash, on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent basis.  These payments are considered secondary in nature.<\/p><p>The Living Alone Increase (LAI) is one of those secondary payments.  It is not a scheme or a stand-alone payment in itself, but rather it is a supplement to a primary social protection payment of &euro;22 per week made to people aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are living alone.  For those aged 66 or over, these payments include State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Non-contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s (Contributory) Pension, Widow's\/Widower's Pension under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme, Incapacity Supplement under the Occupational Injuries Benefit Scheme and Deserted Wife's Benefit.  <\/p><p>Accordingly, there are no circumstances where the Living Alone Increase can be paid to people who are not in receipt of a primary qualifying payment from my Department.

Those who qualify for the payment are not required to sign on, partake in any activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work which is generally the case for recipients of jobseeker payments.<\/p>  <p>  The benefit payment, which is not means tested, is provided under the Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit (Self-Employed) social insurance schemes in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 as amended.  <\/p>  <p>  One of the qualifying conditions for Benefit Payment for 65 year Olds is that a person must no longer be engaged in employment or self- employment.  However, customers may continue to work in subsidiary employment while in receipt of Benefit Payment for 65 Year Olds, provided that the remuneration or profit from the occupation does not exceed &euro;7,500 per annum or &euro;144 on a weekly basis.  Subsidiary employment is defined as work that could have been done while a person was in full-time employment and outside their normal working hours.  Where a person has more than 117 contributions in the 3 years prior to becoming unemployed there is no income limit applied. <\/p>  <p>  A person with investment income subject to PRSI Class K over &euro;7,500 per year would not be eligible to any benefit payment from my Department.<\/p>  <p>  Class S Self-employed contributors pay PRSI on a wide variety of self-employment income.  These contributions help to ensure that individuals qualify for social welfare benefits, including pensions.  The qualifying conditions for Jobseekers Benefit (Self-Employed) include the requirement that a person has completely ceased self-employment.  For that reason, individuals who continue to pay Class S PRSI on a variety of income sources would not satisfy the conditions for Benefit Payment for 65 year olds as they are not regarded as having ceased self-employment; they continue to pay Class S PRSI and are to be regarded as being in insurable self-employment. <\/p>  <p>  A person with distributions from an Annual Retirement Fund of over &euro;7,500 per year would not qualify for the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds as they would be deemed to be in insurable employment. <\/p>  <p>  Any person aged 65 who does not qualify for the benefit payment may apply for the means tested Jobseekers Allowance.  The maximum rate of payment is also aligned with the weekly rate of payment for the Benefit Payment for 65 year olds, which is &euro;208 and increased allowances are paid for qualifying adult and child dependents.  A person can also be engaged in limited employment and may still qualify for a jobseeker's allowance payment subject to satisfying the scheme conditionality. <\/p>  <p>  The issue regarding Class S PRSI contributions arising solely from personal pensions has been raised with my Department and the matter is under consideration.<\/p>  <p>  I hope that this clarifies the position at this time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500082#WRW04700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1334,"content":"<p>Question No. 534 answered with Question No. 533.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1335,"content":"<p>Question No. 535 answered with Question No. 533.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1336,"content":"<p>Question No. 536 answered with Question No. 533.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Eligibility","counter":1337,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500082#WRW05100"},{"type":"question","counter":1338,"qnumday":537,"qnumall":"[18290\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500082#WRW05200","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if a person (details supplied) will be approved for the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.","asker":"1454","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":1339,"content":"<p>Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA) is a support to qualifying customers wishing to take that first step into self-employment.

This ensures that the fuel allowance payment goes to those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods and those who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2022 and with immediate effect the Government increased the weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of Contributory State Pension representing a 20% increase and enabling more people to qualify for this support. <\/p>  <p>  Fuel Allowance operates as part of an overall system of social protection supports which provides assistance payments based on a system of means testing.

Core Funding aims to offer better financial sustainability to providers in return for a cultural shift to a partnership relationship between providers and the State that reflects the public good dimension of ELC and SAC.<\/p><p>On 7th March I announced the rates and values for the Core Funding, and launched the online Ready Reckoner tool. The Ready Reckoner is accessible to all and is designed to give an idea of what services can expect to receive based on their characteristics. It also allows different scenarios of provision to be tested. This will show the benefits of applying for Core Funding when it is possible to do so. <\/p><p>Where providers are experiencing difficulties completing the Ready Reckoner, I would encourage them to engage with their local City\/County Childcare Committee (CCC) who can provide support. <\/p><p>The majority of Core Funding (i.e. &euro;183 million of the &euro;221 million) will be distributed based on a service's capacity - opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available. This &euro;183 million includes allocations for improvements in staff pay and conditions (&euro;138 million), for administrative staff\/time (&euro;25 million), and a contribution to non-staff overhead costs (&euro;20 million).  The rationale for distributing Core Funding based on capacity is that capacity encompasses the primary characteristics that determine the service's costs of delivery. Structuring Core Funding primarily based on capacity will support sustainability and stability for services, since they will have an allocation each year that will not fluctuate in line with children's attendance.  <\/p><p>In addition to the &euro;183 million allocated on the basis of capacity, a further &euro;38 million is allocated to contribute to support graduates to be Lead Educators across ELC and to support graduates as Managers in ELC or combined ELC and SAC services. Heretofore funding has only been available in respect of graduate Room Leaders in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. <\/p><p>Services whose provision is led by a graduate will receive this Graduate Premium, on top of their other funding. The Graduate Lead Educator Premium in Core Funding is paid as a top up on the number of hours of provision that is led by a graduate with a relevant qualification and three years' experience. The Graduate Manager Premium is paid as a top up on the number of hours of operation of a service whose manager is a graduate with a relevant qualification. An ELC Graduate Manager who also works as a Lead Educator can only attract one graduate premium. <\/p><p>Core Funding will address some of the existing disparities in funding levels across ECCE and non-ECCE provision, providing funding proportionate to the age ratio of children being cared for and supporting the employment of graduate Lead Educators across ELC provision. While Core Funding will operate in addition to and alongside ECCE (standard capitation), AIM, CCSP and NCS, it replaces ECCE higher capitation and incorporates funding previously allocated to the discretionary Programme Support Payments (PSP), with an increased allocation, from September 2022.<\/p><p>The significant majority of ELC and SAC services will see substantial increases in income through Core Funding. It is important to state that no service will lose out because of Core Funding.<\/p><p>My Department has issued a funding guarantee to providers. All services will receive at least the same level of funding in Core Funding as they received from higher capitation and PSP in the 2021\/22 programme year, assuming the numbers of children, graduate staff and type of service offered remains the same<\/p><p>Services for whom the Funding Guarantee will apply and those who will see just small increases from Core Funding are ECCE services in receipt of higher capitation for large groups of children and with high occupancy levels. Such services are currently in receipt of the highest levels of public funding relative to the staffing levels required for operating those types of services, &euro;110-&euro;120 per hour of service provided, substantially in excess of the average staffing costs for this type of provision.<\/p><p>The level of investment being made available for Core Funding is an acknowledgement that high quality ELC and SAC costs more than the current income to the sector and that this additional investment is best allocated by linking the quantum of funding to services with their underlying costs of delivery. <\/p><p>This is the start of a multi-annual investment plan and is part of Government&rsquo;s commitment to realising the <i>First 5<\/i>target of investment of approximately &euro;1 billion by 2028. <i>First 5<\/i>and Core Funding recognise that the workforce is at the heart of high-quality ELC. Strong international evidence shows that children achieve better outcomes when staff are well qualified. First 5 seeks to continue to build an appropriately skilled and sustainable professional workforce, and includes a commitment to achieve a graduate-led workforce by 2028. Core Funding introduces a strategic way of funding the sector and begins to implement the recommendations of the Expert Group to develop a new funding model.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500083#WRX03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1477"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mother and Baby Homes Inquiries","counter":1389,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500083#WRX03800"},{"type":"question","counter":1390,"qnumday":554,"qnumall":"[17937\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500083#WRX03900","dept":"Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","minister":"Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth","question":"when the application forms for redress will be sent to survivors of Mother and Baby homes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1478","askee":"1477"},{"type":"speech","counter":1391,"content":"<p>I am acutely aware of the sense of urgency surrounding the establishment of\u00a0the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme and I am focused on delivering the Scheme as soon as possible.

The Kildare DPSU referenced by the Deputy commenced operations in September 2020. <\/p><p>There is now a Divisional Protective Services Unit (DPSU) established in every Garda division across the country. This ensures that vulnerable victims of crimes, such as domestic abuse and sexual violence, presenting to Garda&iacute; are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance.

Training was delivered in 5 individual modules titled as follows:1. Sexual Crime;2. Online Child Exploitation;3. Domestic Abuse;4. Human Trafficking and Victims;5. Court Process.<\/p><p>  The initial position in respect of the DPSU training requirement, is that anyone who has not completed all five modules of this training will be required to undertake the new training programme that will be ready for delivery by Q2, 2022. <\/p><p>  The proposed training programme is expected to enhance the skills of DPSU members, to ensure that each one can carry out the full range of specialist tasks frequently necessitated within their roles.<\/p><p>On foot of the Deputy's question, I contacted An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seek the specific information sought on the number of cases that the Kildare Protective Services Unit has dealt with in 2021 and to date in 2022.

It details the geographies of the six regional health areas, including the hospitals, Community Healthcare Organisations and Local Health Offices contained within each.<\/p>  <p>  The RHA boundaries were decided following detailed population and health infrastructure analyses of patient service usage patterns across the country. This analysis examined patient flows to establish the extent to which hospitals in a given region are serving patients who live in that region. The regions are designed to be as self-contained as possible across the country. Available infrastructure and population demographics were considered extensively when they were being developed. There is no plan at this time to re-examine the boundaries as we have no indication that infrastructure or demographics have changed significantly in a way since then that would require a re-assessment. <\/p>  <p>  The scale of change required to regionalise our health service is significant.

Projections for 2022 show that over 1.5 million patients will be added to active waiting lists this year.\u00a0Many people stayed away from the health service during the pandemic and, as these people come forward for treatment it will place huge additional demand on health services. Under the Waiting List Action Plan, the Department HSE and NTPF will deliver urgent additional capacity to treat 1.7 million people as well as investing in longer term reforms to bring sustained reductions in waiting lists.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to reducing waiting list volumes and implementing reforms, the 2022 Plan will also progress work towards achieving maximum waiting time targets. The 2017 all-party Oireachtas Sl&aacute;intecare Report recognises the need to reduce waiting times for scheduled care services, especially for those with urgent and complex care needs. The Sl&aacute;intecare Report sets out the following recommended maximum waiting time targets for acute scheduled care to be achieved in the long-term that have been adopted as Government targets: no patient should wait longer than 10 weeks for outpatients\/assessments; 12 weeks for inpatients \/ day cases; and 10 days for diagnostics.<\/p>  <p>  However, given the historically long waiting times for scheduled care and the impact of the pandemic, the numbers of people now waiting for treatment and diagnostics far exceed these stated targets. The 2022 Plan will progress practical work towards the achievement of these maximum waiting targets through a phased approach and the delivery of intermediate targets this year, while also seeking to improve and increase capacity and productivity to deliver an immediate and medium-term reduction in waiting list numbers. The 2022 Waiting List Action Plan will progress intermediate waiting time targets this year, as set out in the 2022 National Service Plan of: by end-December 2022,\u00a0 98% of all patients on our waiting list will wait less than 18 months for their first outpatients appointment (OPD) and 12 months for their procedure (IPDC and GI scopes). The Plan also focuses on 15 high volume inpatient day case procedures, including cataracts and hip and knee replacements, so that every person waiting over 6 months for one of these procedures, and who is clinically ready will receive an offer of treatment via the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).<\/p>  <p>  In total, the 2022 Plan details 45 actions to reduce and reform waiting lists. One of these actions is to develop and agree a multi-annual waiting list reduction plan to support the achievement of the Government maximum wait time targets. As part of this action consideration will be given to decisions relating to codifying such targets in legislation to complement the practical work already underway via other actions in the Plan to achieve these targets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500088#WRCC01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public

approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Current priority deliverables under the Strategy are HIV prevention, including the continued expansion of a Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) programme, which commenced in late 2019, and the HIV Fast Track Cities programme, involving Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.<\/p>  <p>  Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge; expanding sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.<\/p>  <p>  A review of the Strategy began in 2021, having been postponed as a result of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Focus group meetings were held with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme team, those working in the STI clinics, the education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community.<\/p>  <p>  The detailed feedback from these meetings has been collated and will inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. Commissioning an external review of the Strategy has been approved and will progress through standard procurement processes, which will commence shortly. It is envisaged that the procurement process will conclude by July, with the Review to take 3-4 months once commenced. When complete, the Report will be published on the Healthy Ireland website. Results will, in turn, inform future policy direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500088#WRCC06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1608"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mental Health Services","counter":1752,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500088#WRCC06100"},{"type":"question","counter":1753,"qnumday":679,"qnumall":"[17515\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500088#WRCC06200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if a group (details supplied) will be included as eligible to receive counselling from the HSE following the 2016 report from the United Nations on safe and child-sensitive counselling which recommended that these services be made available;

While all issues impacting women's health in Ireland are not enumerated in detail in the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan, I can confirm that the HSE and my Department are working with pace to improve the supports available to women with this condition. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the cost and availability of medications needed in some cases of the treatment of Hyperemesis Gravidarum, important work in this area has commenced in the HSE and officials are engaged with the HSE to progress this work in line with the Ministers request for urgent consideration of this matter. This is a key first step in considering options which can better support women suffering with hyperemesis in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The Medicines Management Programme (MMP) has submitted a clinical review and the HSE are now considering if there are potential reimbursement options based on the MMPs recommendations. I\u00a0am hopeful that the HSE can achieve a positive outcome and my Department and the HSE are continuing to work closely together on this issue.<\/p>  <p>  Improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes is a key priority for me and this Government. We made a strong commitment to Promoting Women&rsquo;s Health in the Programme for Government and are fully committed to the development and improvement of Women&rsquo;s Health services and to working with women and girls to improve their health across the whole life cycle. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan 2022-2023 is the first step to these important improvements. It is important to note that the Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan is the first of its kind in Ireland. This plan starts and ends by listening to the women of Ireland. The life cycle of this first plan is of an 18-month duration, is ongoing and will respond to issues as they arise and developing consistently over its life course. The Women&rsquo;s Health Action Plan sets forward a wide range of positive initiatives to support women&rsquo;s health, including maternal health, and provides a framework for further prioritisation as issues and needs arise. It does not enumerate every issue that impact a woman&rsquo;s health but instead spotlights certain issues raised by women in the course of 2019 and 2020 and sets out a framework for regular review to ensure a responsiveness to women on the issues they want to see addressed is embedded in how the plan is implemented.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  It is also supported by significant funding in Budget 2022, for example:<\/p>  <p>  - An investment of almost &euro;9 million additional funding to ensure continued implementation of the National Maternity Strategy into 2022 and beyond, building on the significant investment in 2021,<\/p>  <p>  - Funding which will allow us to continue improvements in our gynaecology services by establishing a further 6 ambulatory gynaecology \"see and treat\" clinics, bringing the total to 20 clinics nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500090#WREE02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Status","counter":1853,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500090#WREE02600"},{"type":"question","counter":1854,"qnumday":712,"qnumall":"[17686\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500090#WREE02700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be called for surgery in the Regional Hospital, Tullamore.","asker":"1596","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1855,"content":"<p>Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

As a prerequisite to this, the existing paper-based Health and Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) will be replaced with an electronic Self-Assessment Health History (SAHH) questionnaire.<\/p>  <p>  The IBTS announced that the first phase of these policy changes to began on March 28th of this year.

My colleague the Minister of State with responsibility for Skills and Further Education also attended this meeting.<\/p>  <p>  Day services for adults with a disability are developed in line with the New Directions policy. The ambitious change envisaged by New Directions is strongly linked to the implementation of the policy of mainstreaming that was a core part of the National Disability Strategy and is now a core part of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of mainstreaming is to move from segregation to inclusion, by ensuring that persons with disabilities can take their place in mainstream society, that mainstream public services include people with disabilities and that mainstream public policies take into consideration their impact on people with disabilities. In terms of service provision, mainstreaming means that services for people with disabilities should be the responsibility of whichever Government department has responsibility for such services in general.<\/p>  <p>  The New Directions approach to adult day services embodies the policy of mainstreaming, and supports service users to access mainstream public services such as further education and training, rather than this type of content being part of the day service itself.<\/p>  <p>  Improved access to mainstream services is essential to let adults with disabilities participate fully as members of communities, and access to further education is key to enabling people to continue to learn throughout their lives.<\/p>  <p>  The twelve supports outlined by New Directions include support to access a number of services that are the remit of several government departments and agencies, including the Department for Further and Higher Education, Research Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), Solas, and the Education and Training Boards (ETBs).<\/p>  <p>  I am continuing to engage with the HSE on this matter.

RPLs are counted in the Year 1 intake, so effectively they skip year 2, directly into Year 3; hence our system does not consider any RPLs in Year 2.  <table>    <tr>       <th>RPL TRAINEES 2021\/22<\/th>       <th>TRAINING YEAR<\/th>       <th>-<\/th>       <th>- <\/th>       <th>-<\/th>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TRAINING SCHEME<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>Per Scheme<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>BALLINASLOE<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>CORK<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>12<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>HSE DUB MID LEIN<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MID LEINSTER<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>MID-WEST (UL)<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NORTH DUBLIN TP<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>5<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>NORTH EASTERN<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>RCSI<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>3<\/td>       <td>7<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SLIGO<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SOUTH EAST<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>SOUTH WEST<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td><\/td>       <td>2<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>TCD<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>       <td>2<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>9<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>WESTERN<\/td>       <td>4<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>1<\/td>       <td>6<\/td>    <\/tr>    <tr>       <td>Per Training Year<\/td>       <td>33<\/td>       <td>18<\/td>       <td>14<\/td>       <td>65<\/td>    <\/tr> <\/table> <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500095#WRKK00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Care Services","counter":2140,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500095#WRKK00900"},{"type":"question","counter":2141,"qnumday":826,"qnumall":"[18090\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500095#WRKK01000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 325 of 3 March 2022, the way identifying relocation arrangements for unnamed residents of a centre (details supplied) constitutes an ethical breach of confidentiality given that relocation options for other service users have been provided;

The Health Service Executive is leading on the implementation framework in respect of the recommendations of the National Policy and Strategy for the provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015.The Neuro-Rehabilitation Strategy Implementation Framework (IF) was launched in February 2019.<\/p><p>The overarching aim of the Strategy is the development of neuro-rehabilitation services to improve patient outcomes by providing safe, high quality, person-centred neuro-rehabilitation at the lowest appropriate level of complexity. This must be integrated across the care pathway, and provided as close to home as possible or in specialist centres where necessary. These services are to be configured into population based managed clinical rehabilitation networks (MCRNs).<\/p><p>Funding was approved to support the introduction of a managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstrator project. The focus of the demonstrator project is the development of post-acute and community neuro-rehabilitation services across CHO 6 &amp;amp; 7. In terms of service provision, this is where the gap is most evident in terms of demonstrating a Network model.<\/p><p>Disability Services Community Healthcare area 6 are currently working on the recruitment process, capital funding for the service has already been received and the location for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team (CNRT) has been identified. Disability Services Community Healthcare area 7 are working with Primary Care to identify the location &amp;amp; governance for the Community Neurorehabilitation Team in this area.<\/p><p>There has been tangible progress with the focus and trajectory of the MCRN in the development of the post-acute and community neurorehabilitation teams and services. The implementation of a 10 bedded neurorehabilitation unit in Peamount has improved timely and early access to post-acute specialist rehabilitation services for patients with complex disability including those neurological complications associated with severe COVID infection from the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. These new beds introduce some 3,500 additional specialist rehab bed days per annum into the system and are expected to reduce the NRH waiting list by over 30%, and take direct referrals from AMNCH, SJH, SVUH, Beaumont &amp;amp; the Mater for patients with neurological conditions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500095#WRKK05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Healthcare Infrastructure Provision","counter":2192,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500096#WRLL00200"},{"type":"question","counter":2193,"qnumday":844,"qnumall":"[18129\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500096#WRLL00300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the procedure with regard to check-ups on newborn babies when they return home;

There are many reasons for such shortages including shortages of raw materials, manufacturing difficulties, logistical\/transport issues or product recalls due to potential quality defects.\u00a0<\/p><p>Medicines shortages can therefore originate at any point in the supply chain and can involve and impact on many different stakeholders. Accordingly, medicines shortages require a multi-faceted, multi-stakeholder response to ensure patient safety, continuity of care and protection of public health.\u00a0Ireland has a multi-stakeholder medicines shortages framework in place, coordinated by the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), to prevent, wherever possible, and manage medicine shortages when they occur.<\/p><p>The HPRA is aware of the current challenges regarding the intermittent supply of some hormone replacement therapies (HRT). The HPRA has had regular and ongoing engagement with suppliers in this regard. The companies that place the products on the market have indicated that the current supply difficulties are due to a significantly increased demand for these medicines in Ireland in recent years. To illustrate, the supply of one range of HRT patches has increased by between 77% and 117%, for the three most-used strengths, compared to 2020. In addition, based on demand in recent months, the company expects a similar increase in the demand for all strengths during 2022. This would mean that the usage of this patch in Ireland would be approximately 4.5-7.5 times higher in 2022 (depending on the strength) compared to 2019.<\/p><p>Regarding the HRT patches, the suppliers have confirmed that they have increased the planned supply of HRT patches to Ireland during 2022 in response to this increased demand. In the case of one brand (Evorel\/Evorel Conti), the supply of HRT patches has resumed. For another brand (Estradot), some strengths are available currently and, based on manufacturing availability, the re-supply of the full range is expected to be in July. With respect to the gels, Divigel was received by the wholesaler on 25th March and has been released for sale this week. An alternative gel product (Oestrogel) has recently gone short and is expected to resume supply in April. In the interim, the company is working to find solutions to the immediate supply issues.  <b><\/b><\/p><p>The current supply situation has arisen due to significant increases in demand for HRT medicines and is not linked to regulatory matters. However, the HPRA continues to review available options within our regulatory remit to facilitate increased supply where at all possible. In particular, the HPRA has advised the companies that we are open to providing accelerated regulatory approval to supply a product originally intended for other markets if available. We are awaiting further information from the companies in this regard.<\/p><p>The HPRA publishes a medicinal product shortages list on its website, with the reason for the shortage, the expected dates for the return of supply and in some cases, such as HRT shortages, the HSE&rsquo;s clinical guidance on the management of patient treatment in response to medicine shortages.

There are derogations to this access rule, including restrictions on access to Member States' coastal waters.<\/p><p>In Ireland&rsquo;s case, other than Northern Irish vessels under Voisinage Agreement, no EU Member State or Third Country has access to our 0-6 nautical miles zone.  Foreign fishing vessels are excluded from the 6-12 nautical miles zone on our North-west Coast, from Lough Foyle to Eris Head, and along the South-west Coast between Mizen Head and Sybil Point.  France, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium have access for specific species in various areas of the 6-12 nautical mile zone along Ireland&rsquo;s West, East and South coasts.  Ireland does not have access to any other Member States&rsquo; 6-12 nautical mile zones.<\/p><p>Last year, the European Commission published a proposal to rollover, for another ten years, the provisions relating to the restrictions on access to Member States' 6-12 nautical miles zones, as set out in the CFP Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 1380\/2013).  I am seeking an extension of the 6 and 12 nautical miles zones out to 12 and 20 miles, respectively.  I believe that there is a strong case to be made to increase the protections for Ireland&rsquo;s fishing fleets in these waters, particularly against the background of Brexit.<\/p><p>Quotas for the various stocks are allocated for management areas - that is, an ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Seas) area or a part thereof - and not Member States' Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ).  Generally, most stock areas straddle more than one EEZ area. These stock areas can include Member States' EEZs, third countries' EEZs and international waters. <\/p><p>For example, the Total allowable Catch (TAC) area for the Hake Stock is ICES Areas 6 and 7 which stretches from the north of Scotland south to the north coast of Brittany, and into the English Channel.This area includes parts of the UK EEZ, the Irish EEZ, part of the French EEZ and some international waters.

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive.

The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. <\/p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM).

The Appropriate Assessment procedures and subsequent mitigation measures in place today go beyond those envisaged in the NIS published at the end of 2014.<\/p><p>Policy documents such as &lsquo;<i>Environmental Requirements for Afforestation&rsquo;<\/i>and &lsquo;<i>Standards for Felling and Reforestation&rsquo;<\/i>published in 2016 and 2019 respectively underpin my Department&rsquo;s approach to protecting European sites, giving a baseline of good practice helping to ensure that the conservation status of qualifying interests will not be adversely affected by the forestry operations being proposed. Publication of &lsquo;<i>Forests &amp;amp; Water Achieving Objectives under Ireland&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021<\/i>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<i>AA Procedure Guidance Note &amp;amp; iFORIS SOP for DAFM Forestry Inspectors (2019)<\/i>&rsquo; are other important documents that help the Department protect European sites.<\/p><p>Geographic Information Systems (GISs) and associated technologies play a major role today in how my Department ensures that European Sites are protected when forestry operations are being carried out. This allows for all proposed projects to be assessed in terms of their proximity to European sites and their associated species and habitats. For example, Hydrological connectivity is assessed at individual site level and this assessment is aided by using the latest EPA GIS data which includes sub catchment data and rivers.  <\/p><p>DAFM's mitigations in relation to the Hen harrier are based on a protocol agreed with the NPWS. Datasets identifying High Likelihood Nesting Areas are regularly updated by the NPWS and the Department is able to immediately update its QGIS systems to ensure that the appropriate measures are applied to the latest data on breeding Hen harriers in SPAs designated for Hen Harriers. Ecologists assessing files have access to this dedicated Ecological QGIS system. Other datasets available in the QGIS system include the Semi-natural grassland survey layer, non-designated hen harrier areas and curlew breeding buffer layer. OSI&rsquo;s  prime 2 water body dataset was also added to the Departments GIS system within the last 12 months. <\/p><p>The Department's data requirements for both statutory and non-statutory designated sites are subject to continuous review and improvement. This includes NPWS data which is updated regularly. Almost 90 amendments have been made to datasets used by my Department since the Forestry Programmes NIS was published in 2014.<\/p><p>The Department has also strengthened its staff resource in the field of ecology, with a strong emphasis on Appropriate Assessment since the NIS was published. Currently, there are 36 ecologists employed by the Department where only one ecologist was employed by the Department when the Forestry programme NIS was written. There are over 40 Forestry Inspectors.  In 2018, the Forestry Inspectors and all Registered Foresters received Annex 1 habitat training, and further Habitat training is planned.  <\/p><p>The SEA environmental report concluded that with the adoption of the listed mitigation measures it was anticipated that none of the effects identified as adverse in the detailed matrix assessment will be of greater than negligible significance and ensure that, even without adoption of enhancement measures, the overall effect of the Forestry Programme is strongly positive. In keeping with the SEA obligations, my Department undertakes monitoring in relation to the implementation of the Forestry Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020 in relation to all sites and not just those designated as European sites. This monitoring is carried out <i>inter alia<\/i>in order to be able to identify at an early stage any unforeseen adverse effects and to be able to undertake appropriate remedial action.<\/p><p>The monitoring programme is ongoing and includes the use of information collated in relation to projects approved under the programme. In this regard significant data is available on the Departments website including the Forestry Division Monthly reports detailing information about  afforestation, roads, woodland Improvement and Reconstitution and Underplanting of woodlands schemes.  Species composition is provided in the Forest Statistics Ireland annual publication also available on the Departments website. The Department&rsquo;s forest licence viewer provides access to view the location of public and private forests as well as proposed forests and proposed roads.  <\/p><p>The Department also monitor information provided by other sources, i.e. from other existing monitoring and reporting arrangements arising from EU legislation other than the SEA Directive and from national legislation or policies, and which can be indirectly used for purpose of monitoring for significant environmental effects arising from the implementation of the programme. Also, the reports required under Article 17 of the habitats Directive on &lsquo;The status of EU protected habitats and species in Ireland&rsquo; and the implementation of the measures taken under the Habitats Directive are reported upon to the European Commission every six years.

The continued development of the pigmeat sector is a priority for me given the pivotal role the industry plays in the national economic context. It is the third largest agri-food sector, and supports approximately 8,000 rural jobs.<\/p>  <p>  Last month, I announced the Pig Exceptional Payment Scheme (PEPS), with a fund of up to &euro;7 million, for commercial pig farmers. This is an urgent, short-term response to assist producers that would be viable but for the extreme current circumstances, and allow space for a more medium-term adjustment to market signals. <\/p>  <p>  This scheme is a once off, exchequer funded scheme open to commercial pig undertakings which had produced more than 200 pigs in the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 inclusive. This includes pigs sent to slaughter, exported or sold commercially from a breeding herd. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was notified to the European Commission under the agriculture de minimis rules, which provide for a maximum payment per undertaking of &euro;20,000.<\/p>  <p>  Applications for the PEPS closed on 20 March 2022. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. All information on the scheme can be found on my Department's website.<\/p>  <p>  This scheme is part of a wider package of measures to support the pigmeat sector, including intensified efforts by Bord Bia to promote quality assured Irish pigmeat in the domestic and export markets with dedicated media advertising campaigns underway nationally, as well as EU-funded pigmeat promotion programmes running in key export markets.<\/p>  <p>  Teagasc has also intensified its dedicated, ongoing advisory supports being provided to pig farmers and is actively engaging with pig farmers to explore the  options potentially available to them. <\/p>  <p>  There is also support for access to finance through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), particularly the Brexit Impact Loan Scheme and the COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme. Both of these SBCI finance products, which are part-financed by my Department, can be used for working capital and include features which will assist the current financial needs of pig farmers.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, my Department continues to engage at EU level to ensure a joined-up EU approach to the challenges arising from Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine, including through the European Food Security Crisis preparedness response Mechanism (EFSCM). Last week the Commission announced the adoption of exceptional support measures across the agriculture sector, along with a communication on Food Security. In addition, the Commission in view of the particularly difficult situation in the pig meat sector has opened a new private storage aid scheme to assist in stabilising the sector.<\/p>  <p>  We are currently examining the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to the exceptional aid allocation to Ireland of &euro;15.8 million in EU funding, and considering how it might be used to support the Irish agricultural sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500100#WRPP03200","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":2455,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500100#WRPP03300"},{"type":"question","counter":2456,"qnumday":937,"qnumall":"[17973\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500100#WRPP03400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"if an organisation (details supplied) has submitted its final report on the review of the legislation and the full examination of the regulatory system for the forestry licencing; if the report has been finalised, if he will provide details of the findings; when he will introduce the recommended changes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1482","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2457,"content":"<p>The regulatory review of the licensing process is an important initiative which is being carried out by a consultant, Philip Lee  and Associates, with legal and environmental expertise under the auspices of Project Woodland.

I have just launched a targeted intervention package for the tillage sector and a multi-species sward initiative, which together are worth over &euro;12 million in support to Irish farmers. The package is aimed at producing more native crops and reducing dependency on imports, and on producing crops with a low demand for chemical fertiliser. An emergency aid scheme for pig farmers of &euro;7 million opened for applications on 7 March. This will provide commercial pig farmers a payment of up to &euro;20,000 each. The first payments to pig farmers under this scheme began to issue on 25 March. The Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is the key mechanism for ensuring food security throughout Europe. I have been engaged with EU Agriculture Ministers since the beginning of the crisis and on 23rd March the European Commission announced, via the communication &ldquo;Safeguarding food security and reinforcing the resilience of food systems&rdquo;, a range of actions to enhance global food security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs. A &euro;500 million package to support EU farmers most affected includes an allocation of &euro;15.8 million for Ireland, which can be topped up by national funding.  I will be examining ways to best mobilise this support as soon as possible, taking account of the detailed requirements and conditionality attached to this exceptional aid provision. <\/p><p>I will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and will continue to work across Government, and with our European partners, to respond to this crisis using all of the tools at our disposal. Last year, according to the Economist's Global Food Security Index, Ireland was ranked first in terms of food security across a range of indicators. While my Department are monitoring the situation closely, all indications suggest that Ireland will continue to be a food secure country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500101#WRQQ01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1546"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Common Agricultural Policy","counter":2486,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500101#WRQQ01100"},{"type":"question","counter":2487,"qnumday":947,"qnumall":"[18322\/22]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2022040500101#WRQQ01200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the provisions that are contained in the new CAP programme for Irish rare breeds (details supplied); and if apart from GLAS, which is closed to new entrants, there are schemes available for promoting farmers to keep Irish rare breeds.","asker":"1519","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":2488,"content":"<p>I believe that it is important to ensure the preservation and protection of rare breed farm animals as a genetic resource for future generations and for the benefit of agriculture in general.  <\/p>  <p>  The current Rare Breeds measure in my Department's GLAS Scheme sets out to retain and, where possible, increase populations of specific rare breed animals to ensure their long-term protection and survival.

The first National Social Enterprise Policy was published in 2019.
