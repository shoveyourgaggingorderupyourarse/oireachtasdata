Ms Nilani Suhinthan, an IT consultant, was headhunted for a job in New Zealand and her husband and family decided to move there.  The New Zealand authorities have issued residency permits to Nilhani, her husband and two of their three daughters - Tanya, who is 19, and Saumia, who is 14.  However, they have refused a permit to their third daughter, Bumikka, who is 15.  Shockingly, the reason for this seems to be that Bumikka has Down's syndrome.<\/p> <p>The New Zealand authorities have told the family that she does not have an acceptable standard of health and would place demands on the health and education systems there.  The family has made it clear that they do not expect the New Zealand state to fund any special health treatment or educational support for their daughter and have offered to fund this themselves since they have well-paid jobs.  Their appeal has been refused and they are in limbo with their family separated.<\/p> <p>The Hyde family face a somewhat similar injustice in Australia.  Anthony and Christine Hyde moved from Dublin to Victoria in 2009.  Anthony works as a bus driver and Christine is a teacher and assistant principal in a local primary school.  Their son Darragh was born there is 2015 and has never been outside Australia.  <\/p> <p>The family applied for permanent residency in Australia and, in the course of the application, their son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, CF.  Incredibly, this diagnosis led to the family's application being rejected due to the potential cost of the treatment of CF.<\/p> <p>An administrative appeals tribunal has refused the family's application and they can now make a final appeal to Australia's immigration Minister, but they face possible deportation within a month.<\/p> <p>Australia and New Zealand are saying that skilled Irish people and their families are perfectly welcome so long as none of them has a condition such as those I have described.  If this is happening, families who have children with these diagnoses are stigmatised and refused entry.  I hope we, in Ireland, would never be so heartless.  I cannot imagine a situation whereby a family from Australia or New Zealand would be turned away from Ireland on the grounds that one of their children was born with a manageable medical or genetic condition.<\/p> <p>There has been an almost total blackout of media coverage on these cases in Ireland.  One can easily imagine that if Donald Trump, or his United States, had denied visas to children with Down's syndrome or cystic fibrosis, there would be media outrage and extensive coverage.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We would ask where our moral values were.

What does this say about the world we are in?  I have been reading a lot about the controversy about Viktor Orb&aacute;n's Hungary and his coining of the phrase \"illiberal democracy\".  When I read about countries we regard as being, or supposedly being, in the vanguard of best practice in terms of human rights and civil liberties, I must ask whether this is liberal or illiberal democracy.  Is it governance without morality?  Is it conceivable that in modern democracies, the legitimate management of public finance allows such blatant and unjust discrimination against the most vulnerable?

In the case of the Hyde family where an appeal is still possible if there is a process, can the Minister intervene and make representations to the Australian immigration minister?  Can the Minister of State confirm that no such grounds would ever be used to deny a child a visa to enter Ireland with his or her family, all other things being equal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#B00400","speaker":"1401","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":12,"content":"<p>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs sends his apologies to the House.

I have come across many UK citizens living in my area and across the country who are very fearful about their situation with Brexit looming.  Approximately 300,000 British citizens live in Ireland and approximately one third of them do not qualify for citizenship through lineage by way of having either an Irish parent or grandparent.

I have spoken to people on doorsteps in my area and they are very fearful of what might happen.  They cannot afford the naturalisation fees.  These are people who may be married to an Irish citizen and may have been living here for many years.

The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria for naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.<\/p> <p>The fees to be paid by an applicant for a certificate of naturalisation are governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Regulations 2011, SI 569 of 2011.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy David Stanton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->The application fee is stipulated at &euro;175, payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation, and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or, in certain cases, where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons, the certification fee is nil, as the Senator pointed out.<\/p><p>While the fee is reduced in the cases outlined above, the fee is waived in its entirety only in respect of refugees and stateless persons.  Any review of fees would have to consider other categories of applicants, such as EU nationals, and the impact any changes would have on the level of fees for all other applicants.  It is important to bear in mind that, under the terms of the common travel area, British citizens resident in the State enjoy unrestricted residence rights within the State, as well as associated rights and entitlements, including access to employment, healthcare, education, social benefits and the right to vote in certain elections.  Indeed, for the first time, these rights have been placed on a more solid basis with the newly-signed agreement between the Irish and British Governments signed by the T&aacute;naiste last Wednesday.<\/p><p>I also remind the Senator that Ireland already operates a less onerous regime in regard to citizenship by naturalisation compared with many other countries.  There are no formal language or civic knowledge tests and a straightforward residence requirement applies to non-nationals.

It is because I have been speaking to a few people who are involved in this area and have looked into the issue a bit more that I am supporting Deputy Rock in his efforts to try to get policymakers to see some sense on this.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have heard that the Garda is setting up checkpoints to confiscate these scooters, which cost people &euro;500, &euro;600 or even more.  They must then pay a fine to get their scooters back.  That is unacceptable.  There is law in place.  To my legal mind, though, there is an issue with its interpretation.  It depends on whether the scooter needs to be pushed to get it started or whether someone can just get on and start it straight away.<\/p><p>The technology exists to make these safe for use on our roads and limit the speeds at which they can travel.  There was a time years ago when cyclists were told to get off roads because they were a danger to cars.  We need to embrace this innovation.  Other cities have done so.  It should be done in a way that is organised, suits our cities and operates in conjunction with cycling.  The more ways that we can find to have people out of their cars and not using pollutants, the better.  It would also take pressure off public transport.  If it can be done in a way whereby helmets are provided, the scooters are parked in specific spots and whatever else is deemed to work well for the NTA's national strategy is done, we should not just leave the issue in a grey area.  That would be unacceptable.  We cannot be complete dinosaurs.  We must examine this issue and sort it out.  Legally, it does not make any sense to suggest that the Garda should confiscate them.  I do not understand that.  We must put a pilot in place in an organised way so that we can see how it works and what its potential pitfalls and problems are.  Irish providers need to be involved.  Irish individuals and companies can, in conjunction with city and county councils, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, put these in place throughout the country in a safe way.  That would make sense.  In this way, the scooters would not be a nuisance to anyone and people could use them to get around effectively.  I would welcome a response from the Minister of State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#E00400","speaker":"1406","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Noone for raising the issue of electric scooters.

The Road Traffic Act 1961 defines a mechanically propelled vehicle as:<\/p><blockquote>A vehicle intended or adapted for propulsion by mechanical means, including-(<i>a<\/i>) a bicycle or tricycle with an attachment for propelling it by mechanical power, whether or not the attachment is being used,<br \/><br \/>(<i>b<\/i>) a vehicle the means of propulsion of which is electrical or partly electrical and partly mechanical,<\/blockquote> <p>Electric scooters and powered skateboards fall into this category and are therefore considered to be mechanically propelled vehicles.  Any user of such vehicles in a public place, as defined in the 1961 Act, must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence, with penalties under road traffic laws, including fixed charge notices, penalty points, fines and possible seizure of the vehicle, for not being in compliance with these requirements.  As it is currently not possible to tax or insure electric scooters or electric skateboards, they are not considered suitable for use in a public place.<\/p><p>The Minister has asked the RSA to research how electric scooters and other such vehicles are regulated in other countries, particularly EU member states.  He is keen to understand the road safety implications of the use of such vehicles on public roads, especially when interacting with other vehicles.  He is due to receive the outcome of the authority's research within the next few weeks.  He will need to be satisfied that permitting such vehicles on our roads will not give rise to safety concerns for the users themselves as well as all other road users, including cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.  However, the Senator should note that, should the Minister decide that the benefits derived from the use of electric scooters outweigh the risks associated with using this type of transport, an amendment to primary legislation would be required.  He will not be supporting a pilot scheme for the use of electric scooters in our cities while the use of such vehicles in a public place, as defined in the Road Traffic Acts, is <i>ultra vires<\/i>.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#F00200","speaker":"1277"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I will make a brief response, although I could respond all day.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Catherine Noone:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I have alluded to the fact that there is an interpretation problem in the sense that one could argue that the fact one must manually propel some of scooters before the electric element kicks in indicates there is a grey area here.

The response to a parliamentary question that was submitted asking about this was shocking in that it stated in black and white that there was no planned date for completion of costs and implementation plans for providing 7-7 child and adolescent mental health services.  The cost of the implementation plan is the first step.  We have all agreed within these Houses, the HSE and among Ministers to deliver the 24-7 services that have been requested.  However, 7-7 services are the initial ask and task for us.  It is essential that we follow the service plan for 2019.  The HSE does not seem to be meeting its commitment to develop such services.  When will these vital services be delivered?  I guess the HSE needs a reminder.<\/p> <p>We all know the importance of services that are provided from Monday to Friday.

I welcome any campaign that deals with stigma.<\/p> <p>On the issue raised by the Senator, the HSE service plan for 2019 commits to developing all aspects of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  This includes developing a seven-day per week service for CAMHS to ensure improved support for vulnerable young people, as well as related initiatives in enhanced early intervention and day hospital care.  Community based CAMHS teams provide specialist mental health services for young people up to the age of 18 years and operate on a five-day per week basis.  Expanded CAMHS provision will be in line with adult services where a seven-day service is being developed.<\/p> <p>Where a child has a mental health crisis, the initial consultation should be with the child's general practitioner, GP, and if the GP assesses that the child requires an urgent mental health assessment, the GP should contact the local CAMHS team.  Where a person under 18 years of age presents to an emergency department following self-harm, it is important that he or she receive a compassionate and empathic response.  He or she should receive a bio-psychosocial assessment from a suitably qualified mental health professional prior to discharge from hospital.  It is recommended that children under 16 years of age be admitted overnight to a paediatric ward.  The paediatric team should ensure the child receives a bio-psychosocial assessment prior to discharge from hospital, thus following international best practice.  In some hospitals the child will be assessed by a non-consultant hospital doctor, NCHD, who can discuss the case with the on-call CAMHS consultant.  In other services, there might be no on-call CAMHS consultant and the paediatric team will be advised to wait until the CAMHS consultant is available.<\/p> <p>The HSE national clinical programme for the assessment and management of patients presenting to an emergency department following self-harm aims to ensure all such patients receive a bio-psychosocial assessment.  The programme is being extended to include the three paediatric hospitals in Dublin.  Three clinical nurse specialists, one for each of the three Dublin paediatric hospitals, are being recruited.  The addition of a specialist in each of the hospitals will improve follow-up care.  In addition, all three Dublin paediatric hospitals provide a comprehensive liaison psychiatry service.  In Temple Street Hospital it is provided in conjunction with the local mental health service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In Crumlin and Tallaght children's hospitals the liaison psychiatry service is available Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Outside these hours, children are assessed by paediatricians and admitted to a paediatric ward.  In Cork University Hospital there is a liaison psychiatric nurse available Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  This nurse is supported by a consultant from CAMHS.  Outside these hours, a NCHD completes assessments and CAMHS consultants provide input, as appropriate.<\/p> <p>CAMHS inpatient units currently operate a 24-7 tertiary model of care for young people with severe or complex mental health issues.  There are 74 CAMHS inpatient beds in four units in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will have an additional 20 CAMHS beds.  There will be ten CAMHS beds in the new forensic mental health complex which is due to open at Portrane next year.  It will be the first such unit nationally.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#H00200","speaker":"1359"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":54,"content":"<p>I do not wish to thank the Minister of State.

There is a serious lack of these units in schools in Dublin 6, Dublin 6W, Dublin 8 and Dublin 12.  I asked my colleague Deputy James Browne to table a question to the Minister to ask how many persons were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in the south central area of Dublin.  We received a reply from the HSE stating there was no comprehensive national or local children's disability database that gathered data for children with autism spectrum disorder or other diagnostic groups.  That is remarkable, especially when huge funds are allocated to autism services.  It is most important to find out where the children who need these services are in order that funds can be directed accordingly.  There is a huge demand for ASD units in the Dublin 6, 6W, 8 and 12 areas.  The lack of statistics alone shows how low this issue is on the Government's agenda.

This fantastic scheme was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  One of the problems with it is that it is so fantastic that many cr&egrave;ches are closing their new baby wards such that families are finding it very difficult to find childcare places for babies aged from six to 12 months.

They are working ahead of us all the time and the problem for us is that we have to catch them.  Our cybersecurity network structure is excellent at the job its does, and we should acknowledge that at this time.<\/p><p>I wish to raise two points with the Leader.  We heard yesterday that the cost of renting an apartment in Sandyford is &euro;2,100 per month.  The cost of a mortgage for the same apartment is &euro;1,350 per month.  That indicates there is quite a bonanza for those who can afford to buy a number of apartments.  I acknowledge there is no Member of this House who is not concerned about the issue of homelessness and the various other problems with respect to housing.  I have raised previously the possibility of easing the banking rules.  A relation of mine has spent &euro;87,000 on rent in the past seven year.  That person could have bought an apartment and be well into the repayments of the mortgage at this stage had there been access to a mortgage but the problem is this person cannot save the deposit.  Where will this person get the deposit when paying out that sort of money on rent?  From that point of view, could the Leader arrange for the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to come to the House to debate this issue and outline what influence can be brought to bear on the Central Bank with respect to the rules that apply.<\/p><p>The second issue I wish to raise concerns the Defence Forces.  First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the report in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times <\/i>that there is some ease for the Defence Forces with respect to their pay claims.  I compliment the Public Service Pay Commission, the Defence Forces, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Chief of Staff, in particular, for the work they have done in trying to secure this.  I hope other public servants would not see this as a bonanza for everybody to jump on the bandwagon.  The Defence Forces have been at the bottom of the heap for quite some time.<\/p><p>Yesterday the Minister told the D&aacute;il that 200 members of the Defence Forces had availed of sick leave.  It has been seen as an extraordinary high number.  I ask people to bear in mind that members of the Defence Forces are constantly working in very physical roles.  It is not uncommon for people to break their legs, have back injuries or various other injuries.  The problem is that we do not have the infrastructure within the Defence Forces to treat those members and, in many cases, they have to go on to the public waiting list.  That is where the differential kicks in.  Commissioned officers have access to private health insurance whereas 85% of the members of the Defence Forces who are service men and women, enlisted men and women, non-commissioned officers, etc., do not have the funding to afford private healthcare and, as such, they are dependent on the public health system.  God be with the days when I was in the Army where if one got sick there were the hospitals one could attend and one was treated totally by the Defence Forces.  Sadly, that is not the case any more.  I do not want the message to go out that we now have malingerers in the Defence Forces.  People need to realise that members of the Defence Forces abseil out of helicopters, engage in extremely physical activities and quite a number of them are involved in sporting activities.  By their very nature, these activities bring injuries with them and, as such, there is a backlog of cases to be treated.  I will leave it at that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#O00200","speaker":"1390"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":64,"content":"<p>At the weekend we heard the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform comment on the national broadband plan.  When asked about possible knock-on effects of the spend on the national broadband plan, he rejected any notion that Government plans for tax breaks would be affected.  He effectively said, no matter what the cost of the national broadband plan, money would still be found to cut taxes.  In other words, we should not worry, the money would be found.  That is an extraordinary statement.  I call on the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss this obsession with tax cutting above all else.  Terse answers have been given to the likes of patients waiting for life-saving drugs.  Schoolchildren are waiting on the delivery of proper school buildings.  Older citizens have had their home care hours slashed in recent years while people are desperately waiting on housing lists, yet the priority, as stated again at the weekend by the Minister for Finance, is tax cuts.

These people are porters, chefs and support staff who have honoured the Lansdowne Road agreements, who have gone through a job evaluation process and who have been awarded money through that process but are now being snubbed by the Minister for Finance.  The Minister sits in breach of his own Lansdowne Road agreement.  He cannot find money for those workers, but he will find money for tax cuts.  Last night I met childcare workers in Clare, as part of SIPTU&rsquo;s Big Start campaign.  They are people on abysmally low wages who have campaigned for years but the Minister can find no money for them either.  What does that tell us about the priorities of Fine Gael in government?  They are tax cuts, tax cuts and tax cuts.  The health service is in crisis and housing is in the worst crisis of the history of the State, but the Minister can only make one guarantee, namely, regardless of what else happens in the State, he will deliver tax cuts for his wealthy friends.  It is high time for a debate on this issue.<\/p> <p>I was very struck by the comments of a Fine Gael spokesperson on TV last night on the rent crisis.  He said that if it is given time, the rent crisis will work itself out.  People who are renting simply do not have time.  Every month expensive rental accommodation sees them further away from ever having a home of their own.  This evening in the D&aacute;il there will be a debate to enshrine the right to a home into the Constitution.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proud to take that stance today.  I do not wonder what position Fine Gael will take; it will oppose it.  Perhaps we need a real debate on the ideological chasm that exists in this Chamber.  Fine Gael and its obsession with tax cuts are costing the people of this country far too much.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#P00100","speaker":"1389"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":65,"content":"<p>Before I make my main point I wish to pay my respects to Fidelma Doonan, an usher in the Houses, whose brother died suddenly yesterday.  He happens to also be my nephew's grandad.  That is how I became aware of it and I thought it would be nice to pay my respects to Fidelma.<\/p> <p>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 19 would be taken before No. 1.  Today, I intend to introduce the Electoral (Civil Society Freedom) (Amendment) Bill 2019 to the Seanad.  The Bill aims to fix an urgent problem with the Electoral Acts, which currently sees valid political advocacy by civil society organisations and community groups treated as electoral activity by the Standards in Public Office Commission.  As a result, it attaches disproportionately high, stringent and unfair financial declaration requirements to the work.  The interference by the State in the political lobbying activities of civil society groups was an unintended consequence of an amendment made to the Electoral Acts 18 years ago.  The amendment was made to the Bill responsible in the Seanad during a Committee Stage debate on 14 June 2001.  It is an urgent issue that has seen some civil society groups forced to close their doors in the face of the high compliance standards required, such as Education Equality, a group of concerned parents who came together to work for secular education.  We must support groups of ordinary people who want to organise together to agitate for positive change and yet the laws just get in the way.  Ireland is a world leader in civil society advocacy, including to the UN Human Rights Council and the European Union, yet European Union fundamental rights agencies and the Standards in Public Office Commission criticise the law domestically.  It undermines us internationally and opens us up to charges of hypocrisy and needs reform.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Lynn Ruane:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In a Commencement debate in the Seanad on 29 November last year the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, admitted that he was aware of the problem and the concerns expressed and saw its potential resolution within the process to set up a new electoral commission.  However, this process could feasibly take years to come to fruition, whereas the current issue needs to be resolved in a timely fashion.  That is why I am tabling the Bill today.  I thank colleagues in the Civil Engagement group, the Independent group, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party for co-sponsoring the Bill which I hope to see receive cross-party support in the House in the near future.  The problem has been caused by bad legislation and has damaged Ireland's vibrant civil society space.

I know that it has been discussed in the House, but it is urgent.  Last week we heard, for example, that the Ballina Salmon Festival was not being run this year because of the high cost of insurance.  Just today I was contacted by the principal of St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe and told that the cost of insurance had risen last year from &euro;3,221 to &euro;19,199, a colossal increase.  The school contacted the school governance board and the database section of the Department of Education and Skills, but it got nowhere.  It used money it had fundraised to meet the bill, but on Friday last it received an email from the patron to say Allianz Insurance's quote for this year had risen again, this time to a staggering &euro;26,317.  The Department suggested the school try to negotiate with the insurance company and offer to pay in monthly or other instalments, but the insurance company flatly refused to negotiate with the school and stated it had two days to make up its mind.  The school made up its mind, but it has no way of paying the cost of the insurance.  It is going to have to close.  The issue is really urgent and I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Education and Skills.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#Q00300","speaker":"1392"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I am reading with concern about the appointments that may be made in the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, and about how some influence might be brought to bear by what are perceived to be Government agencies, if not by the Government itself.

I am not saying there is interference, but I understand some people within the organisation are concerned that if it is perceived to be the case, the governing body at international level may decide to cease giving the FAI the financial support it requires.  I am sorry about being a little vague, but I am concerned that I have received a number of calls about the matter.  The last thing we need is for funding for any organisation to be withdrawn because of a perception, rather than what is actually happening on the ground.  It is important that that be made clear.  I understand fully that there is a need for full and thorough oversight of every organisation that is receiving state aid, including the FAI, which is accountable for that funding and making sure it is assigned to the areas for which it was given on the first day, but that does not give any Government agency or the Minister the right to interfere in how an appointment is subsequently made.

The stationmaster will be relocated to another station which already has adequate staff.  In 2017, the station was thought so beautiful that An Post captured it on a commemorative stamp.  We now hear Irish Rail plans to lease it out.  To say it is not busy enough to keep it manned is unacceptable in a rural town.  People in towns such as Bagenalstown matter.  This issue is so important.  We speak about rural areas but Bagenalstown, which has one of the most beautiful railway stations in Ireland, is now being told the man who runs the station will be going somewhere else.  That is unacceptable.<\/p><p>Irish Rail has told us 80% of users avail of online ticketing and that only 20% of passengers go into the station to buy tickets.  That does not matter.  What about the 20%, who need to have the service in the railway station?  I have been informed by Irish Rail that a staff member will disembark at all stations to help with machine tickets and acceptability issues.  I worry that we are slowly destroying rural Ireland and its way of life.<\/p><p>Transport poverty and accessibility are social and environmental issues.  More than one in four people living with a disability do not use public transport due to accessibility reasons.  What we are now seeing will further prevent the use of public transport at a time when we need to be considering ways to reduce our carbon footprint.  I am very concerned that, without a staff presence in Bagenalstown, there will be an increase in anti-social behaviour.  The issue of maintenance needs to be examined but we also must consider the requirements of people who need help - the 20%; they matter.  They include older people who do not use online services and those with disabilities.  My office telephone has been ringing for the past week.  I have been contacted by older people, in particular.  They are so concerned about this.  Individuals with disabilities are also ringing me.  A disability rack may be pulled out for wheelchairs users.  College and schoolgoing children also use the services in the station.  What is occurring is unacceptable.  Irish Rail cannot afford to be turning away customers.  I fear this is what is going to happen.<\/p><p>I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this.  I believe what I describe is happening across the board.  It is happening in Athy and it has happened in Thomastown.  It is unacceptable that rural Ireland is being forgotten.  We have to ensure that we provide the services to the people.  God be with the days when one said, \"Hello\", to everyone.  One went into the train station and people said, \"Hello\", and asked how things were.  Are we changing all this?

The Leas-Chathaoirleach was present.  We had an excellent presentation from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton.  The meeting was interesting because of the considerable engagement and the questions.  The Minister responded to all the questions, and queues of additional people wanted to engage with him on them.  We would benefit by having the presentation here, if possible.  The Minister was exceptional.  Everyone from all the jurisdictions talked about a Minister who was totally on top of his brief.  He was asked many questions and had no idea what questions would be asked.  He responded very well.  It would be good to see him here.<\/p> <p>I attended the beef summit in Galway last week.  There were many parliamentarians there, as there were city and county councillors, particularly from Galway but also from other parts of the country.  One of the points arising in the environmental debate is that of a just transition.  We need to concentrate on that.  I would like to hear more from the Minister on it.  There has to be a just transition.  Certain groups will suffer more than others.  We have to guard against that.  Just transition is a really important aspect.<\/p> <p>Let me refer to agriculture, producers and farmers in regard to just transition.  This issue is important.  If we want to achieve targets, we have to incentivise.  We have not used the word \"incentivise\".  I believe in incentivising people.  I would like to hear more about just transition and how we can incentivise people.  We have a plan and targets but we have to incentivise people  to succeed.  If it all possible, and if it fits in with the schedule of the Minister, whom I realise is busy because he has a lot going on, he should be invited to make his presentation to the Seanad.

It is not only a feature of rural Ireland as many of the railway stations in Dublin have been unmanned for quite a long time.  That has led to a degree of anti-social behaviour at those stations because the person who manned the station acted as an early-warning signal.  He or she could see what was happening at the station, who was getting on the train and if there was a problem.  A passenger could step off the train and tell the person manning the station of a problem happening on a train.  We need to be cautious.  The Government is working out the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  There is real value in manning railway stations.<\/p> <p>I wish to raise a matter close to the Leader's heart.  I welcome the Cork area transport strategy that was announced today.  It has the potential to change Cork for the better over the coming decade but I have slight concerns.  I hope the National Transport Authority, NTA, has learned lessons from community engagement in Dublin.  Many people from the Labour Party in Cork have been on to me today voicing their support but they also want an extension of the consultation period which currently runs until 28 June.  Cork is in the middle of local and European election campaigns and a plebiscite about whether there will be a directly-elected mayor for Cork.  Those Labour Party representatives feel it would benefit the city if the consultation period was extended.  I echo their calls and ask the Leader to engage with the Minister to see if he will extend the consultation period.  The citizens of Cork need to have ownership of the transportation plan for the city.  They need an opportunity to input their ideas.  I hope we do not end up in conflict with communities as has been the case in Dublin.<\/p> <p>Consultation can be done well and properly.

That is not so.  In fact, it is quite the contrary.  The amendment we dealt with on the last occasion merely copperfastened the position set out in the Bill and in the Constitution in bringing some common sense to a procedural issue.  There will be a requirement for a slight tweaking on Report Stage.  I acknowledge the initiative by Senators McDowell, Norris and others but it does not do what it was purported to do in the national newspapers.  In any event, the amendments being considered in this grouping are designed to add experience to sit alongside skills and attributes, as the description of one of the two statements to be prepared and published by the procedures committee under Part 8 of the Bill.<\/p><p>Briefly, the procedures committee will be set out in accordance with section 16.  We can recall from section 10(2) that the functions of the commission shall be to select and recommend a person to the Minister for appointment, to approve a statement for selection procedures and a statement of the requisite skills and attributes for inclusion in what would be a published statement.  Part 8 deals with the published statement.  It provides the means by which the second function of the commission, as set out in section 10(2), is to be discharged and, later, in section 53, the procedures committee is empowered to prepare for submission to the commission a statement setting out selection procedures and a statement of requisite skills and attributes.  Sections 53(5) and (6) set out matters that the procedures committee shall have regard to in preparing these statements.<\/p><p>With respect to the amendment, we are considering the second type of statement dealt with under Part 8, namely, the statement of requisite skills and attributes.  The effect of amendment No. 97a and the latter amendments, which Senator McDowell has accepted are broadly similar, if not identical, would be to change the description of the statement of requisite experience, skills and attributes.  Amendment No. 97a seeks to insert the term \"experience\" in the definition of what requisite skills and attributes means while amendments Nos. 97b to 97e, inclusive, would restyle the statement of \"requisite skills and attributes\" as a statement of \"requisite experience, skills and attributes\".<\/p><p>I am not minded to accept amendment No. 97a because Part 8, for the most part, deals with matters other than those relating to technical qualifications or experience; it deals with selection procedures.  The amendments in this grouping do not appear to concern that aspect in respect of the published statements.  We must accept the fact that experience is something entirely different from attributes, attributes being qualities and characteristics we would seek such as determination, honesty and work ethic.  In short, I do not want to prescribe anything in particular for candidate judges because that will be an obligation on the part of the procedures committee.  Experience is different from attributes.  <\/p><p>We have already dealt with, over a considerable period, the basis for the assessment of a number of factors such as qualifications, knowledge and probity.  Practice, experience and knowledge are to the fore here and that is important but it must be brought forward by the candidate in an application and by the commission in a recommendation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Charles Flanagan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Experience is somewhat different from what might be regarded as more objective headings or attributes.  My preference is that it will not be for the commission or the procedures committee to determine what type of legal experience, judicial experience or any other experience might be required.  The basic qualifications and experience requirements are provided for in the Bill.<\/p><p>I believe that under section 56, for example, the committee can review the qualification requirements and the commission can seek research in that regard.  The committee can report on the matter to the commission.  However, this is still somewhat different from the matter of experience.  The amendments are unnecessary because this is adequately provided for in the foregoing provisions of the Bill and it is not appropriate to insert them in section 50. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#DD01400","speaker":"1233","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":132,"content":"<p>I want to focus on the word \"attributes\".

The point I want to make, and it is at a more serious level than those observations, is that experience that might be very relevant to whether somebody was appointed, say, as a judge of the Circuit Court, is, for instance, service as a member of the Residential Tenancies Board, the Employment Appeals Tribunal or in the asylum process, or on an appeals board for the State, where they would have demonstrated, and could be asked about, a capacity to be judicial or quasi-judicial.  Experience is, therefore, hugely important.<\/p> <p>If we take the notion that experience should not be one of the stated criteria, we must ask whether the commission should be blind to the comparative experience of two people who are candidates for short-listing.  Surely it must give some credit for satisfactory performance and experience of a judicial or quasi-judicial kind.  Surely, as Senator Norris said, if somebody was going to be appointed to the Circuit Court or the District Court and it appears they have been an in-house conveyancer for a bank and a practising solicitor for the previous 20 years, that experience must be weighed against that of somebody who has experience of litigation in the courts or in one of the tribunals established by the State.  I do not accept the proposition that it is inappropriate to take into account experience in this context.<\/p> <p>What worries me about excluding it is that people who have no experience will be recommended on the basis that the Minister in the Seanad said that experience was not something which should feature in these statements or in the published documentation.  The argument will, therefore, be made that, historically, the Act was not intended to give credit for experience, where it is relevant.<\/p> <p>Of course, I accept that not all experience is relevant and it cannot be the sole determinant.  However, it must be part of the mix if we are choosing somebody to be a judge at whatever level in our judicial system, but more particularly the more senior the appointment.  The fact that somebody has experience of court practice and procedure must be a significant issue in determining that person's suitability, especially when this legislation wants that to be done.  It is unfortunate it is doing two things: first, selecting out of the group of people three people who the commission is then recommending to be first viewed by the Government; and, second, between them, ranking them in importance.  The Minister drew our attention on the previous occasion to the fact they were to be ranked in importance but he did not draw our attention to how - and I had to go and research how - that provision had come into the text of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->If memory serves, it was a proposal from Deputy Clare Daly.

If we are going to compose shortlists and accept Deputy Daly's amendment which provides that there should be an order of preference within the shortlist of three, it makes little or no sense not to draw the commission's attention to the need to examine the experience of the various people it is considering for the shortlist.<\/p><p>I should add that I tabled amendments in respect of the situation where the Government wishes to recruit a number of judges to expand, for example, the family courts or the Court of Appeal's appellate side in the criminal area.  My amendment, which we will reach in due course, indicates that the Minister in those circumstances may direct the commission to have regard to the fact that the Government is looking for family judges, not just chancery judges or landlord and tenant judges, and that the commission is obliged when making its recommended list to have regard to the underlying purpose of the vacancy on which the Government is asking it to make a recommendation.  That is an essential amendment to the Bill, but we will reach it in the fullness of time.  In that context, in particular, it is inappropriate to say that experience is irrelevant.  To choose not to include it in the list of attributes of a person to be recommended and to reject an amendment designed to include it is to create a false devaluation of experience, which should not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#FF01200","speaker":"1403","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":144,"content":"<p>To make a brief comment, in advertisements offering jobs to the public it is almost invariably the case that they ask people to state their experience.

I firmly believe there is sufficient reference to the matter of experience to allow the commission to weigh it up in its deliberations.  It is covered and there is no necessity to include further words at this stage, particularly in Part 8 which deals solely with the selection procedures and the requisite skills and attributes.

In section 50 we are dealing with, I hope, a period in time in which specialist family courts will become the norm and District Court and Circuit Court judges will tend to specialise in those cases, rather than having family law litigants waiting for the afternoon while the television licence cases are dealt with in the morning.  They are dealt with later in the same day by a judge who is understandably tired after a long list in the morning and who then has to listen to a highly sensitive and emotional family law case.

The early enactment of this Bill has been given priority by the Government and the Attorney General and facilitated by Deputies in all parties in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and it now comes to the Seanad for its careful consideration.  I thank Members for the time they are devoting to it this week in order that, hopefully, the Bill will pass both Houses this week.  I will not pretend that this Bill will put an end to the current crisis.  It will not, but it will definitely delay and has good potential to prevent homelessness for many households.  The significantly extended notice periods for tenancy termination will afford tenants a greater chance to find alternative accommodation, with or without the support of a State scheme.  The new powers for the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, to investigate and sanction improper conduct by landlords will ensure that any rent increase in a rent pressure zone, RPZ, or any tenancy termination, is lawful.  The RTB will have the choice at the outset to prosecute landlords for new related criminal offences through the courts rather than using its own new administrative sanctioning powers if it deems it necessary to do so.  Neither the RTB, nor I, seek to criminalise landlords but if persistent and serious, unlawful conduct by landlords occurs, I think we can all agree that a criminal record, a fine and imprisonment might be the only appropriate course for the RTB to pursue.  Under this Bill, all RPZs will continue in force until the end of 2021.  If this Bill is not enacted, the RPZs or rent caps in the Dublin local authorities and in Cork city are due to expire in December of this year.  Again, I think that we can agree that we still have high rents in those areas and in the other RPZs and that Government intervention is urgently needed to extend rent caps beyond the end of this year.<\/p><p>For the first time, new homes for the rental market and large institutional landlords will be covered by rent caps and associated regulation, which is significant.  I will get into the detail of the Bill a little later but I wish to reaffirm for Senators that all of our efforts, as a Government and as an Oireachtas, are being directed towards solutions that will help bring the crisis to an end.  Fundamentally, supply must be and is being increased, thanks to the policies the Government has pursued and is spearheading through Rebuilding Ireland.  As supply increases, we must also ensure that we protect people who are currently struggling with housing affordability and security issues.  That places a particular focus on the need to continue to reform the rental sector.  The rental sector in Ireland still needs to develop and mature in order to provide a viable, sustainable and attractive alternative to home ownership, rather than serving as a temporary refuge or a staging post on the route to home ownership.  The rental market here is not like that of other European countries yet.  It is true that we do not have a mature rental sector but we are trying to transform the sector into a more mature European-type one, but we do so at a time of undersupply which makes it very challenging.  We do not have a cost-rental market.  In other countries, provision of cost-rental accommodation provides 20% to 25% of total accommodation.  We are at the very early stages of building a cost-rental sector.  If we get it right, the long-term benefits are obvious.  What we do have is the Residential Tenancies Board, which provides strong protection to both tenants and landlords.<\/p><p>A professional landlord sector similar to other European countries is beginning to build in Ireland, but the majority of landlords, some 86%, own only one or two properties.  Many are accidental landlords following the financial crash in this country, which is still having an impact today on housing, banking and public and private debt levels.  The make-up of the landlord sector, with its heavy reliance on small and accidental landlords, has to be borne in mind.  We must be careful in making changes to residential tenancy law, that the changes do not inadvertently cause an unsustainable exit of landlords from the rental sector, which would only make things worse.  Recent data from the RTB tell us that landlords have left the market.  More than 1,700 have done so since 2015.  That is a real and legitimate concern that all of us must keep in mind as we progress new reforms in this sector that protect tenants.  We must work with what we have and secure continued participation in the residential rental accommodation sector, as we improve and reform it.  That will require participation from the traditional landlord as well as participation from the larger, institutional landlords, some of which have only recently begun to participate in the residential rental sector in Ireland.  Such activity must be regulated and taxed appropriately.  I accept that there is concern with regard to institutional investment in the sector and the Department of Finance and my Department will closely monitor developments in this area.  At present, fewer than 5% of landlords own more than 100 units.  The vast majority of landlords, or just over 70%, own just one property, with a further 16% owning just two rental properties.  Official CSO statistics of the purchasing activity of institutional investors in 2018 will be available later in the summer but in 2017, the combined purchasing activity of property funds, real estate firms and real estate investment trusts, REITs, accounted for a net 1% of transactions.  Crucially, institutional investment is adding to supply, and that is explicitly recognised and welcomed in this week's <i>daft.ie<\/i>report on the rental market.  We must be careful and measured in our assessment of developments in the rental market.  We need supply to grow.<\/p><p>Figures from the RTB show that more than 339,000 tenancies registered from both private and approved housing body landlords at the end of 2017.  People are not renting solely because they cannot afford to buy a home, although I recognise that is a challenge for many in Ireland today.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Many are renting because they choose the flexibility that renting offers or because they do not want to take on the significant debt that is a mortgage, or the liability that home ownership can sometimes become.  It is also true that Irish life is changing, and has been for some time.  As far back as 1991, the level of home ownership started to decrease.  Changes resulted in people staying in education longer, marrying or committing to a partner later and putting down roots in a community at an older age than in previous generations.  These factors are also leading to a growing demand for rental properties, different types of rental properties from the ones that we may have seen before and a better functioning rental sector.  Not only in our rental policy have we sought to meet this demand but also in the new planning and building guidelines that we have developed in the past 18 months around build-to-rent apartments, more cost-effective apartment delivery and the introduction of new concepts such as co-living.  These reforms are now leading to an upsurge in planning applications for new apartments.<\/p><p>While it is the case that renting has been a negative experience for some and has not meant a secure and safe home, renting works for the vast majority, and we need it to continue to work, but to work better than it has been working, with greater transparency and accountability for tenant and landlord and, crucially, greater affordability. <\/p><p>Under Rebuilding Ireland, a rent increase restriction of 4% per annum was introduced in rent pressure zones, where very steep rent hikes arose on foot of particularly high demand.  What we have seen in RPZs to date has been a moderation of rent inflation, particularly for existing tenancies, but rent inflation and rents themselves remain unacceptably high in many parts of the country.  This is also having an impact on people's quality of life as they try to save for a home.  They try to make unacceptable sacrifices to meet the rent or sacrifice time with their families by making long commutes because they cannot meet the rent closer to where they work.  Others are living in overcrowded circumstances or have to move back in with parents at a time in their lives when they should not have to.  Those really suffering have found themselves without a home and are in emergency accommodation today.  There are too many in that situation.  These scenarios demonstrate the importance of the Bill that we have before us.<\/p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2018 builds on what has been achieved by the Residential Tenancies Acts and the RTB to date.  The Bill provides for the future development of the rental sector, with stronger protections for tenants.  The Bill centres on priority proposals in order to facilitate quick passage through the Oireachtas.  It does not address everything that we need to do in the rental sector.  I expect to submit a further rent reform Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny later this year.  The Bill before Members today contains the priority measures that we believe are necessary and must be enacted now in the best interests of existing and future tenants.  My colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann have helped prioritise its passage, and I hope Senators will agree that this Bill will improve the situation for many households and assist in having it put onto the Statute Book as soon as possible.<\/p><p>The Bill delivers on a number of commitments flowing from Rebuilding Ireland and the commitments made in September 2017 to provide the RTB with additional powers and resources to deliver enhanced protections to both tenants and landlords.  The key measures and reforms are designed to enhance enforcement powers for the RTB; provide greater security of tenure for tenants; and further underpin the operation of the rent caps, along with some further targeted priority measures, including bringing student accommodation under the remit of the RTB, in addition to RPZs, and introducing amendments to the Planning and Development Acts to provide for the regulation of short-term lettings.  <\/p><p>The Bill is set out in three Parts and 38 sections.  I will now refer in some detail to the main provisions.  Part 2 amends the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and provides for a number of key changes.  For example, sections 3 and 37 of the Bill are key provisions to apply the Residential Tenancies Acts to student-specific accommodation let under a tenancy or a licence to a student by a private provider or a public educational institution.  I have worked together with the Minister of State responsible for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, the Attorney General and members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government to make this happen.  I thank all involved, specifically student representatives and the RTB, for assisting to make sure that this important legal change has made it to the Seanad for consideration today.  It is important that the rent increase restriction in RPZs apply in this sector and that there be recourse for students to the dispute resolution services of the RTB.  Sections 4, 5 and 18 provide for consequential technical amendments required in the context of the student-specific accommodation sector.<\/p><p>Section 6 amends section 19 of the Act of 2004, which relates to rent setting by, among other things, modifying the exemption from the rent increase restriction of 4% per annum for dwellings coming onto the rental sector in an RPZ.  Under the Bill, any dwelling being let that has not been let in the previous two years can set a rent that does not exceed the market rent level.  Any rent increase thereafter cannot exceed the rent increase restriction of 4% per annum until after the expiry of the RPZ.  This modification tightens the exemption in respect of new lettings and new landlords and should be effective in better restricting annual rent increases in RPZs.  <\/p><p>We are inserting a definition of a \"substantial change in the nature of the accommodation provided under the tenancy\" in respect of which an exemption applies from the rent increase restriction or cap of 4% per annum to the extent that the works carried out to the dwelling concerned consist of a permanent extension that increases the floor area of the dwelling by at least 25%, improves the BER by seven ratings or results in at least three of the following: the internal layout of the dwelling being permanently altered; the dwelling being adapted to provide for access and use by a person with a disability; a permanent increase in the number of rooms within the dwelling; in the case of a dwelling with a BER of D1 or lower, an improvement of at least three ratings; or, in the case of a dwelling with a BER of C3 or higher, an improvement of at least two ratings.  This definition is important and has been developed as the D&aacute;il debates on the Bill progressed.  The most recent changes relate to the BER improvements required.  I am happy that the Bill recognises the importance of reducing emissions.  I am also happy that tenants will see real benefits and real cost savings as a by-product of better restricting the use of this exemption.  The provision makes clear that the exemption cannot be claimed in respect of works solely carried out for the purposes of compliance with regulations covering minimum standards for rented dwellings.<\/p><p>Landlords will now also be required to notify the RTB, and to provide supporting information, where they wish to avail of an exemption from the rent increase restriction.  Also, three new offences are provided under section 6, namely, non-compliance with the rent increase limit provisions, knowingly or recklessly furnishing information to the RTB that is false or misleading in a material respect in a bid to claim an exemption, and non-compliance with the new requirement to notify the RTB of an exemption claim.<\/p><p>Section 20 of the Act currently provides that after 4 December 2019, rent reviews outside RPZs can again occur on an annual basis.  Currently such reviews can only occur on a biannual basis.  Section 7 of the Bill amends section 20 of the Act of 2004 to extend the provision for biannual reviews until 31 December 2021.<\/p><p>Section 8 of the Bill amends section 24A of the Act of 2004 by providing that the average rent criterion to be used for the purpose of qualifying an area within Kildare, Meath or Wicklow as a RPZ should be based on rents in the 27 local authorities outside Dublin and the average rent to be used for areas outside of the greater Dublin area, GDA, should be based on the rents in the 24 local authorities outside the GDA.<\/p><p>Currently, a single average rent is used for the entire country, and section 8 is intended to make it easier for areas to become a RPZ and to recognise the effect that rents in Dublin and the GDA have in raising the average rent level that must be exceeded.  Section 8 also provides that existing RPZs shall now expire on 31 December 2021, irrespective of the expiry date placed on any RPZ designation order made to date.<\/p><p>Section 10 of the Bill inserts a new section 24BA into the Act of 2004 to provide that the administrative area of Cork City Council, which was deemed a rent pressure zone on 24 December 2016, shall include the area transferring from Cork County Council to Cork City Council on 31 May 2019.  Some of the areas being transferred, in Ballincollig and Carrigaline, are already designated as RPZs.<\/p><p>Sections 12 and 13 of the Bill amend sections 34 and 35 of the Act of 2004 in connection with tenancy terminations.  A registered architect or surveyor will be required to certify that any substantial refurbishment or renovation works cited as a ground for a tenancy termination would pose a health and safety risk to any occupants and should not proceed if the dwelling is occupied and that such a risk is likely to exist for at least three weeks.  Once such works are complete, a re-letting must be offered to the former tenant, where contact details have been provided.  Currently, such a re-let offer is only required where such works are completed within six months of the termination date.  Where a landlord notifies of a tenancy termination grounded on his or her intention to sell the dwelling, this Bill provides that such an intention must be framed within the nine months following the termination date rather than the current three-month timeframe.  The Bill also requires a landlord to provide a statutory declaration to the tenant that where he or she does not enter a contract of sale within that nine-month period, he or she is required to offer a re-letting of the dwelling to the former tenant.<\/p><p>Under the Bill, where a tenancy is terminated because a landlord or a family member wishes to occupy the dwelling, that dwelling must be offered for re-letting to the former tenant where they have provided contact details if it becomes vacant within 12 months of the termination, rather than the six-month period provided for currently.  Also, where a tenancy is terminated because the landlord intends to change the use of the relevant property and where the tenant has provided contact details, the landlord will now be required, within one year of the termination, rather than within the current six-month period under the Act, to offer a re-letting of the dwelling to the former tenant.  A landlord will now also be required to copy the RTB with a termination notice within 28 days after the termination notice period expires.  This will assist the RTB in the operation of its new investigation and sanctioning power under section 28 of this Bill.<\/p><p>Section 15 of the Bill inserts a new section 64B into the Act to clarify that the combined duration of any Part 4 tenancy and any subsequent further Part 4 tenancy should count in the &ldquo;duration of tenancy&rdquo; used in calculating the termination notice period to be given under the tables to section 66 of the 2004 Act.<\/p><p>Section 16 of the Bill amends section 66 of the Act of 2004 to increase significantly the notice periods a landlord must provide in serving a notice of tenancy termination to any tenant who has occupied a dwelling for more than six months and less than seven years.  For example, for any tenancy of a duration longer than three years and less than seven, the tenant is entitled to 180 days' termination notice, which is approximately six months' notice, representing an increase of almost 100 days' notice for some tenants.  These longer notice periods should take some of the pressure off tenants at what can be a very stressful time.  Section 16 also specifies 28 days as the minimum notice period applicable to tenancy terminations by a landlord or tenant in student-specific accommodation.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Sections 19 and 20 technically amend sections 93 and 109, respectively, of the Act of 2004 to empower the RTB to charge for its mediation service.  There are no plans at this time to charge for its mediation service, but there is a recognition that it is a costly service for the RTB to provide and that cost recovery may be required in the future.  <\/p><p>Section 21 technically amends section 123 of the Act of 2004 to make it mandatory for the board to publish its determination orders and notices of cancellation thereof.  The board currently has the option of publishing.  The amendment aims to enhance transparency.<\/p><p>Section 22 amends section 134 of the Act of 2004 to require the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB.  The aim is to gather accurate and detailed tenancy and rental data on an annual basis.<\/p><p>Sections 25 and 26 amend sections 137 and 137A, respectively, of the Act of 2004 to provide for the RTB to charge a &euro;40 fee for annual registrations of tenancies.  A reduced registration fee of &euro;20 applies for approved housing body, AHB, tenancy registrations by an AHB.  A late fee of &euro;10, or &euro;5 for AHBs, will apply for each month a tenancy remains unregistered.<\/p><p>Section 27 inserts a new section 144A into the Act of 2004 to empower the RTB to pursue updates to its register from landlords on rent alterations related to tenancies in their dwellings.  A new criminal offence is created for non-compliance with the requirement to update rent information on the RTB register.  The contravention of the requirement under section 139(1) of the Act to update the RTB on rent alterations is also listed in the new Schedule 2 as improper conduct by a landlord which will be subject to the sanctioning regime under the new Part 7A of the Act.<\/p><p>Section 28 inserts new sections 148R to 148AG, inclusive, into the Act of 2004 to form a new Part 7A dealing with complaints, investigations and sanctions.  This is the key section of the Bill, providing the RTB with its new administrative investigation and sanctioning powers.  The RTB is empowered to initiate an investigation with or without a complaint being made by the public of improper conduct by a landlord under the Act.  Oral hearings on improper conduct may take place.  Sanctions may be imposed that take into account the nature of the improper conduct in question and may comprise one or all of the following: a financial penalty of up to &euro;15,000, payment of RTB investigation costs up to &euro;15,000 and a written caution.  The section provides for a right of appeal to the Circuit Court against a sanction.  If no appeal occurs, the section requires the Circuit Court to confirm all sanctions.<\/p><p>Section 29 technically amends section 151 of the Act of 2004 by extending the functions of the RTB to include the investigation of landlords and the imposition of sanctions in accordance with the new Part 7A.  As Minister, I will be legally required by this amendment to report to the Houses of Oireachtas on prevailing rent levels in the private rented sector based on 12 months of annual registration data collected by the RTB.<\/p><p>Section 30 inserts a new section 164A into the Act of 2004 to provide for the appointment of authorised officers and decision makers by the RTB and the creation of a panel of authorised officers and a panel of decision makers for the purposes of implementing the new sanctions regime under Part 7A.<\/p><p>Sections 31 and 32 provide for minor technical amendments to the Act.<\/p><p>Section 34 inserts a new Schedule 2 into the Act of 2004 which details the improper misconduct by a landlord in respect of which investigations may be caused under Part 7A, including non-compliance with the rent increase restrictions; non-compliance with the new requirement under the Bill for a landlord to notify the RTB where he or she wishes to avail of an exemption from the rent increase restrictions; seeking to rely on an exemption from a rent increase restriction in respect of a dwelling that does not comply with the exemption requirements; non-compliance with the requirement to register a tenancy; non-compliance with the requirement to update the register with particulars of rent alterations; false or misleading citations of tenancy termination grounds in tenancy termination notices; and a failure to make re-letting offers to former tenants where required to so do in accordance with the new provisions we have included surrounding re-letting offers.<\/p><p>Section 38 inserts a new section 3A into the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for the regulation of short-term lettings, proposals which are aimed at addressing the impact of short-term letting on the private rented housing market in areas of high demand.  In that regard, it provides that the short-term letting of a house in a rent pressure zone is a material change of use.  Accordingly, planning permission is required, unless a specific exemption applies.  The Bill provides me, as Minister, with specific regulation making powers that will enable planning authorities to require persons involved in short-term letting in rent pressure zones to provide specific and specified information for their local planning authority.  A contravention of a requirement of such regulations will be an offence and subject to a summary fine of up to &euro;5,000.<\/p><p>Short-term letting is defined in the Bill to mean \"the letting of a house or part of a house for any period not exceeding 14 days, and includes a licence that permits the licensee to enter and reside in the house or part thereof for any such period in consideration of the making by any person (whether or not the licensee) of a payment or payments to the licensor\".  The provisions in the Bill related to short-term letting will be supplemented by exempted development planning regulations which will clarify that home sharing and limited short-term letting in a person&rsquo;s principal place of residence will be allowed in rent pressure zones to an annual cap of 90 days without the need for planning permission.  As required by the planning code, the regulations will be brought before the Oireachtas for approval before signature.  Accordingly, there will be an opportunity to discuss the short-term letting regulations in detail with the joint committee before they come into effect on 1 July.  These proposals strike a reasonable and appropriate balance between alleviating the impact of short-term tourism letting on the private rental market and facilitating tourism letting where private rental need and housing demand are not acute.  I trust they will receive the support of the House.  <\/p><p>In addition to the changes being ushered in by the Bill, the RTB is actively pursuing a range of modernisation initiatives and being better resourced to deliver enhanced protections to tenants and landlords.  The proposed new powers for the RTB under the Bill are a crucial step in expanding its overall role and functions as part of a multi-annual change management programme to enforce tenancy law proactively within the residential rental sector.  Budget 2019 provided for a 67% increase in Exchequer funding to strengthen the RTB's powers and provide for greater local authority inspections in the residential rental sector.  The Bill represents a significant evolutionary step in the development and enforcement of residential tenancy law.  The introduction of powers through the Bill for the RTB to sanction improper conduct by landlords who flout the rent increase restrictions in RPZs and tenancy termination procedures should deter such conduct and protect tenants.  I do not want to see landlords sanctioned or criminalised, but I want the RTB and the courts to have the power to do so, if required.  Landlords who conduct their affairs lawfully have nothing to fear.  I do not want to deter investment in the rental sector, particularly during a housing and homelessness crisis, but I do want to prevent homelessness.  Every section of the Bill protects tenants.  The Government has to step in to protect the most vulnerable.  A household facing homelessness because of an illegal rent hike simply deserves better protection.  I commend the Bill to the House as an important and necessary step to strengthen and enforce security of tenure for tenants.<\/p><p>Although I recognise it is not normal conduct of business to take the Bill in one week as proposed, the importance of the legislation and it being brought into effect as quickly as possible speaks for itself.  Any further unfortunate delay would have a consequential impact, particularly on our ability to commence the regulation of short-term letting on 1 July as proposed and agreed to in the D&aacute;il and on Committee Stage.  Senators have performed due diligence on this issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, and I have appeared many times in the Seanad to deal with housing issues.  On many occasions we have discussed the challenges of affordability and insecurity of housing facing those who are renting who sometimes, unfortunately and unacceptably, find themselves homeless, as well the challenge of getting short-term letting stock back into long-term letting stock.  All of these issues have received a great deal of scrutiny in this Chamber and at the joint committee.  The Bill has been subject to a great deal of scrutiny and it is imperative that it now be passed by the House in order that it can be enacted and we can proceed to have the new laws in place to protect tenants and, crucially, that on 1 July we can begin to get short-term letting rental homes back into the long-term rental market in rent pressure zones where the demand is highest and they are needed most.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#OO00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>Group spokespersons will speak first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#QQ00200","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>It is good to have the Minister in the House.  I have great concerns about particular issues he raised.  On rent pressure zones, it worries me that County Carlow which has two of the best third level colleges in the country is not included among them.  The issue has been raised with me on numerous occasions and I am weary asking the Minister why it is the case.  I will return to the issue, about which I have massive concerns.  It is one of the biggest in the context of the Bill.<\/p><p>It now costs more to service a rental bill than a mortgage.  This situation where massive portions of take-home pay are being devoured by skyrocketing rents must not continue or it will cost far more in the future.  According to today's edition of <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, the number of landlords increased by almost 350 in the past year, in spite of warnings that many landlords were afraid to re-enter the market owing to new regulations and that we had to exercise caution in that regard.  The article referred to figures compiled by the Residential Tenancies Board which revealed an average monthly rent payment of &euro;1,366 in January 2019.  It also referred to data from <i>daft.ie<\/i>which indicated that only 2,700 homes were available to rent on 1 May, the lowest figure recorded in 13 years.<\/p><p>There are massive issues in the rental sector and we need legislation to respond to them.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the legislation which draws on the Bill published by it which aims to strengthen the RTB to hold landlords to account and expand the rent pressure zones designated period for a further three years, particularly in the case of student accommodation, which is very important.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is not enough.  This Bill does not go far enough at all.  I have massive concerns.  Much more needs to be done to get to grips with the rent crisis.  We need to move to a system of building more homes.  We are talking about local authorities, rent pressure zones and various agencies, including the RTB, but unless there is supply, it does not matter how much legislation we bring in, it will not work.  We have to try this in the short term, but we need to do it.  With regard to allowing for long leases, we need to support landlords but also tenants.  We seem to be borrowing pieces from the rental systems of every other country, but we have our own system here and we need to find solutions for our own country.  I welcome the move to apply the rent pressure zone regulations to student accommodation and plans to roll out rent transparency.  I see the Minister is rolling this out in Dublin and in other areas, but he needs to confirm whether it will cover my own area, about which I have massive concerns.<br\/><br\/>Much more is needed if the national scandal of homelessness is to be addressed.  We need additional investment in a cost rental system that will offer accommodation to workers on ordinary incomes who fall above the threshold for social housing but who are crippled by spiralling rents.  Further practical steps such as a national rent deposit scheme, local authority quality certificates for accommodation and incentives to provide accommodation above shops are also required.  That is so important.  There are vacant units over shops in our towns and villages that could be used as rental accommodation, but the incentive is not there and no proper scheme was put in place so landlords did not take the opportunity.<br\/><br\/>Dublin remains the most expensive place to rent with average monthly costs now at &euro;1,620, representing an increase of &euro;141 on the same period last year.  According to the<i>daft.ie<\/i>report, Dublin rent levels are now 36% higher than they were during the previous boom more than ten years ago.  Rent pressure zones have not been effective because the underlying problem of lack of supply remains and because these zones were self-policed.  It was unrealistic to expect tenants to argue with a landlord over prices they were quoted.  We need a radical overhaul.<br\/><br\/>I welcome this Bill as it strengthens tenants' rights by empowering the RTB and making rent levels more transparent.  Again, however, supply is the key and addressing this issue is the only way forward.  We cannot operate on the basis of catching up.  Our rental sector is relatively young and we are learning as we go, but we need to step up the pace.  This Bill will not, by itself, solve the rental crisis.  Ultimately, boosting supply will be critical to meet the growing demand, particularly in areas hit by the housing crisis but also throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>Budget 2019 was not a landlord's budget.  Our rental market needs landlords if it is to work.  It does not incentivise landlords to stay in the system.  Some 40,000 landlords left the system from 2012 to 2018, 4,000 of whom left in the past 12 months.  We need to keep these in the system or there will be fewer units available to rent and rents will rise.  Mortgage interest relief is targeted at small landlords with two units or fewer to keep them in the system.  We need additional tax measures such as local property tax relief and commercial rates relief for accommodation above shops to keep them in the system.  The Minister needs to give some incentive in this area and he is not doing so.<br\/><br\/>The Government has been playing around with a cost rental pilot project since 2015 but has not put a single brick in place yet.  This needs to be escalated and expanded to allow workers on ordinary incomes to access quality and affordable accommodation.  A national deposit scheme would help avoid disagreements with landlords over deposits while a quality accommodation certificate would boost the quality of the rental stock.<br\/><br\/>I am happy to support some of this Bill.  More needs to be done.  There are so many questions.  Why are some areas in rent pressure zones and others are not?  I have asked several times why accommodation in some counties qualifies when neighbouring accommodation across the road in another county does not.  The RTB has been very helpful but it needs more powers.  How many staff has the Minister given it?  Who is going to enforce this legislation?  When we introduce Bills, we need to make sure they are enforced.  It has always been the same.  People who had spent longer than three or four years in a rented accommodation were always entitled to six or seven months' notice if they were to be evicted.  This notice could not be given on a normal piece of paper.  It had to be given through a solicitor or the courts.  That has always been part of the legislation, but it has never been enforced.  We need to start enforcing tenants' rights.  We have good tenants and good landlords but we have to solve our housing crisis.<br\/><br\/>We have a massive housing crisis.  The Minister is trying his best to solve some of it, but if he does not put rent pressure zones in every local authority and if he does not give more staffing to the RTB, this will fail.  One of the biggest issues that the Minister is not addressing, and I have said this on several occasions, is the need for local authorities to have more power.  Most local authorities have no power anymore.  The Minister needs to give them power and to make sure they have enough staff to check accommodations.  There is not enough.  The Minister should put more money into the issue and should be able to come back in six months with figures for how many houses the 31 local authorities have inspected.  That is not happening.  In fairness to the local authorities, they are doing their best but the Minister needs to step in.  We can bring in all the rules and regulations we like, but unless the Minister sorts out rent pressure zones in every local authority area, gives more power to the RTB, makes sure these provisions are enforced by tenants and landlords, and allows local authorities to play a bigger part, we will have an issue.<br\/><br\/>I do not want to be negative.  There are good parts to this Bill.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il will be tabling some amendments tomorrow, for which we will be seeking the Minister's support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#QQ00300","speaker":"1395","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":177,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  As the previous speaker said and as the Minister has acknowledged, this Bill is dealing with a crisis.  There is a shortage of living accommodation in Ireland and the result of this has been monstrous increases in rent in some parts of the country.  That is a fairly obvious consequence of the lack of housebuilding, homebuilding, and apartment building we have seen in recent years, coupled with an increasing population in urban areas and transport difficulties.  All of those things are entirely predictable.  It is our response to them that has to be measured and careful.<\/p> <p>I have a slightly different perspective from that of some other Members of this House.  I have been in the position of being a landlord of an entire house, which was furnished to a very high standard.  It was furnished even down to cutlery and teaspoons and all of the furniture was of high quality.  I will make one point.  That is an entirely different situation from the so-called Vienna policy about which we have been hearing recently.  Under this policy, people will build apartments and let them to another for 20 or 30 years.  Some people want to build high-quality executive houses to let out to others on a short-term basis and to have remedies.  Others want to build an apartment block such as those we formerly had in the Mespil flats and to accept less than the ultimate market rent to have a steady income from an investment in an apartment block.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, are doing that.  I strongly believe that we need a system that differentiates between the two.  If people are given long-term leases on apartments by real estate investment trusts, those people have different expectations from those of somebody who lets a house for a year as an executive.  They will have different expectations in respect of the standard, the fitting out, and who is going to repair the washing machine and so on.  They are totally different worlds and we have to have different sets of landlord and tenant law to deal with them.  One of the problems is that the RTB has been asked to deal with everything on the basis of more or less the same rules applying to everything.  That is a mistake.<\/p> <p>In making my second point I again speak from personal experience.  I was brought up in a rent-controlled house.  My father voluntarily increased the rent on a house on a third of an acre on Leeson Street from &pound;120 to &pound;240 per annum.  I know what controlling rents can do in the end - such measures were declared unconstitutional - but one has to look at the underlying economic forces in a society when one is dealing with this issue.  One cannot be like King Canute and try to freeze or hold things down unnaturally when there is, for instance, increasing demand for property in Dublin from an increasingly prosperous population, which is growing.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Michael McDowell:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is going to be difficult and things cannot just be frozen as they were.

Fair enough.  The most important thing in the Bill, and I support this strongly, is the introduction of administrative sanctions and penalties but they must cut both ways.  If a landlord is behaving appallingly, there should be sanctions against that landlord.  If a tenant is behaving appallingly, there should be some form of fairly quick sanction.  I received an email to my office today relating to tenants who were told to go 14 months ago and are still there and asking to be taken to court.<\/p> <p>This deals with the kinds of people Senator Murnane O'Connor was talking about.  If we want someone anywhere in the county to provide a house or two flats to other people by way of private rental dwelling, they must be provided with decent remedies.  They cannot be allowed to be brutalised or to find their place completely messed up and to have virtually no comeback.<\/p> <p>It is the fashion of the day to sympathise with tenants and show little sympathy to landlords because a minority of landlords gouge their tenants.   I agree with having sympathy for tenants but the great majority of landlords that I ever met would take far less than the market rent if they got a satisfactory tenant who made life easy.  The Minister's Department should be very careful about the role of buy-to-let landlords.  They are important and will continue to be.<\/p> <p>A previous Minister, John Gormley, decided he would get rid of bedsits and threw petrol on the flames of homelessness in Dublin despite his brilliant intentions.  One of the most amusing aspects of that was that bedsits were made illegal if they had shared kitchen or bathroom facilities.  Of course, there was a simple loophole in that whereby the landlord could let the whole house out to all of the bedsit tenants, making them joint tenants of the whole house, without changing anything.  In the meantime, 10,000 people lost their homes.  <\/p> <p>I saw on the news yesterday evening that it is significantly cheaper in Sandyford in Dublin, if one can get a mortgage, to buy a house and pay the building society or the bank the repayments than it is to rent.  We have to be very careful about whether these measures, well-intentioned as many of them are, will not make it increasingly unlikely that private landlords will stay in the market.  We are not continental Europe.  The Vienna solution is not available for the great majority of Irish people.  We have a different problem on our hands if we drive people out of the market, as is happening now.  Rents in Dublin have gone to an all-time high but the amount of houses available for rent has plummeted to an all-time low.  There are some iron rules of economics which cannot be ignored.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#SS01100","speaker":"1403"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I also welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  I believe the Minister will hear a balanced debate on this important topic.  The Minister needs and deserves our supports in all of his efforts to increase housing output, residential and rental, and that is acknowledged by the contributions of all Members, Opposition and others.  The Minister will hear various proposals in this House that will assist him in that.  I know the Minister is doing his utmost to prevent further homelessness.  He wants to achieve the objective of a sustainable, normalised rental market.  All of us in this House must do all in our power to help him to protect and sustain long-term tenancies.<\/p> <p>The RTB has been mentioned and it plays an important role in terms of registration, monitoring compliance and adjudicating disputes.  Positive strides have been made to adequately resource the RTB, to allow it do its work in adjudicating and making effective and early decisions where it must and that is important.<\/p> <p>I am concerned that 1,700 landlords have left the market since 2015.  There are reasons for that which we must understand.  I have no doubt there are many rogue landlords and we must acknowledge there are also rogue tenants.  We have all heard horror stories from both sides.  It is important that all landlords and tenants are not tarred with the same brush when people step out of line.  As other contributors have stated, we must be careful that legislation is seen as fair and addresses the societal challenges we face in housing and rental in the current climate.<\/p> <p>We all recognise there is a rental crisis at the moment.  That is why we have designated rental pressure zones.  We must therefore respond and that is why I support the legislation before the House tonight.  We should review the legislation after two or three years, by which stage, hopefully, the housing output will be continuing to increase and the market will be normalising.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views on that.<\/p> <p>The Bill will enhance powers to investigate landlords and impose sanctions for non-compliance, as it should.  Standards and regulations are set down to protect tenants but I agree with Senator McDowell that, while sanctions apply to landlords, there should also be sanctions for tenants when they step out of line, are not being fair or reasonable, are not respecting property or the tenancy they are offered.  The RTB might have a role in that if it is empowered correctly.  It is important to recognise that it works both ways.<\/p> <p>The Bill also ensures that annual registration by landlords of tenancies are kept up-to-date in terms of records.  <\/p> <p>I have heard Senator Humphreys raise the issue of Airbnb and how it is affecting long-term tenancies on numerous occasions in this House.  The Minister also understands the pressures that is bringing.  This Bill will also regulate short-term lettings in rental pressure zones.  It will address rental properties in these zones with rental periods of fewer than 14 days, which essentially intends to address the Airbnb issue where good rental properties are possibly being taken up with short-term lettings.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Paudie Coffey:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I understand why people might want to do that, but we have a crisis and we need to respond to it.  This is a resource that is available to us to try to respond to that crisis.  It is a mechanism and a measure being introduced in legislation in a crisis by the Minister to try to address that, and that should also be acknowledged.  The Minister said he hopes it will be implemented by 1 July, and he also committed to the House that the regulations for short-term letting will be consulted in the Oireachtas joint committee.  I welcome that approach because a wide range of views will be heard there as well.<\/p><p>Legislation must be fair in how it deals with both landlords and tenants.  We have to be concerned when landlords are leaving the market, because the fewer landlords we have, the fewer tenancies that will be available for people who need them.  It is important that we see increases in housing output in both the private and public sectors, and we need to ensure that continues.  We all acknowledge that there is a scarcity of properties, as well as upward rental pressures, which are beginning to level off, which is welcome.  I note recent by the economist, Ronan Lyons, in which he said that the solution to this is to encourage private developers to build and institutional investors to become landlords.  The alternative view to that from various housing associations and social housing advocates is that housing should be provided mainly and only by the State.  I believe that the solution is in the middle.  It is a balance of both, where we need to see more private residential development and more social housing developments.  Rebuilding Ireland is the plan that will address that, and it is beginning to become fruitful.  We can see that from the numbers, and the thousands of houses that are becoming available year on year, but that needs to continue.<\/p><p>I need not tell the Minister about the increases in rent in rental properties nationally.  The national average is now at &euro;1,366, and it is much more than that in Dublin.  In Waterford city, the average is &euro;972 per month, and it is &euro;847 per month in the county.  The concern is that rent is now becoming more expensive than actual mortgages, and that has to be a cause for concern.  It is not normal, and we therefore need to look at new mechanisms, which I know the Minister is doing all the time, in terms of affordable housing for both purchase and rental.<\/p><p>I wish the Minister well.  I know there will be criticisms of the legislation but people should understand that it is a response to the crisis we are in.  We are being innovative in trying to leverage properties that are there but are, unfortunately, not available due to short-term letting, and trying to make them available for long-term lettings.  That is to prevent homelessness, essentially, and to try to make renting more sustainable in this country.  I support the Minister in his efforts, and I hope the House will as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#SS01200","speaker":"1422","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":191,"content":"<p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Bill and will be supporting it.  I am disappointed, as ever, when we have to submit amendments quite rapidly or before Second Stage is finished, but I will not dwell on that tonight.  There is much more that needs to be done, both within and beyond this Bill.  We saw from yesterday's <i>daft.ie <\/i>report that the average rent in Dublin hit over &euro;2,000 for the first time, and it has been on the rise for 31 quarters now.  That highlights the inconsistency and non-compliance with rent pressure zones, RPZs.  The report also highlighted that there were just 2,700 homes available to rent nationwide on 1 May, which is the lowest recorded since <i>daft.ie<\/i>started compiling those statistics in 2006.  In contrast, more than 4,000 hotel bedrooms were under construction in the first quarter of this year.  Similar to how, during the financial crisis, workers were reluctant to assert their workers' rights, we are now seeing the same situation where tenants are reluctant to assert their tenancy rights for fear of having no place to call home at all.<\/p><p>The rental crisis has highlighted that even when laws are strengthened in regard to tenants, there is still a cohort of landlords who actively evade those laws.  Lettings that do not meet minimum standards or overcrowding laws, non-registration with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, or rents raised higher than RPZ limits are all commonplace.  We need the RTB to have the resources to inform all renters of their rights and to build up tenants' confidence.  That is a funding issue.  We also need the RTB and local authorities to be funded so they can carry out inspections to combat non-registration.<\/p><p>Furthermore, the continuation of rents being higher than mortgage repayments in every property type and county in the State highlights a harsh reality for most renters, who are paying grossly inflated rents, are therefore unable to save for a down payment on a house, and are locked into a vicious cycle.  While the Minister will say that Rebuilding Ireland is the remedy to this, a Rebuilding Ireland home loan requires, in many cases, a down payment of &euro;28,800 in cities like Dublin.  The affordable housing scheme is still in its infancy, and properties acquired under Part V are meeting the huge social housing need.  When Rebuilding Ireland was launched in 2016, did the Government believe that the situation would become as dire as it has today?  We are sinking further into the crisis.<\/p><p>One issue the Bill is addressing that I largely welcome is the limitation put on so-called renovictions, the action where landlords can evict tenants from lettings for the purpose of &quot;substantial renovation&quot;, and are able to rent outside of RPZ limits when they re-advertise the properties.  I have heard, albeit anecdotally, of this happening to tenants more so over the last couple of months than in any other time, and I wonder whether some landlords are doing this in anticipation of this legislation.<\/p><p>I seriously welcome the inclusion of student accommodation under RPZ legislation.  I commend the efforts of the Union of Students in Ireland, as well as the NUIG and DCU students' unions, on this.  We put forward a proposal on it in the past, so I welcome and commend that move.<\/p><p>I welcome the extension of the notice to quit periods, which form part of the Bill.  We proposed a 90-day period in the past if a tenancy was six months old, as opposed to 35 days.<\/p><p>I welcome the Minister's amendments during Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il aimed at curbing short-term lettings.  Dublin, in its current status, is quickly becoming like larger European cities which reap the benefits of tourism but fail to cater to residents.  I bring attention to robust enforcement of those measures, and support for Dublin City Council to perform that enforcement.<\/p><p>I and Sinn F&eacute;in are disappointed that the Bill does not include enabling legislation for a rental deposit scheme or a limit of one month on the amount charged as a deposit.  The deposit protection scheme has had legislation approved by Cabinet as far back as 2014, and five years on I am sure many deposits have been lost unfairly.  I understand the Minister has stated that further legislation to deal with this is at a biting point, and maybe he could provide an update on that as well.<\/p><p>We will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage, and we have submitted a small number of amendments for the remaining Stages.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#TT00200","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":192,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.

It moves the balance slightly away from landlords and towards tenants, ensuring greater protection in renting.  This is vital if we want to stop the number of people being evicted into homelessness and tackle the precarious situation so many families are facing.<\/p><p>I am happy to see an increase in the sanctioning powers of the RTB and the penalties available, in particular the extension of criminal liability to landlords who break the rules.  If the RTB is to do its work, it has to have teeth and be able to enforce the rules set by the Oireachtas.

The extension to cover student accommodation and the increased notice rights for tenants are also important.  We all know that a key function of this House is to review legislation passed by the D&aacute;il and to see where it can be improved.  In that spirit, I will not speak at length about the welcome measures included in the Bill, which I recognise and acknowledge.  Instead, I want to focus on issues that still need attention.  I will address some of these areas on Committee Stage and Report Stage and will table amendments along with my colleagues in the Civil Engagement group.<br\/><br\/>We have been speaking to Threshold about the legislation as it stands.  I share its view on section 34(b) and the problem with the ongoing issue of no-reason evictions.  A landlord is able currently to terminate a Part 4 tenancy after four or six years with no reason given.  There are situations where a family with young children have been living in a property for almost a decade, paying their rent, and they are removed through no fault of their own.  This is a horrendous situation to be in and the stress that it causes is beyond terrible.  We will not have a healthy, secure rental sector unless people are able to plan and look forward.  Rebuilding Ireland has committed to moving towards indefinite tenure but that is not reflected here.  Landlords need to understand that they are not selling a normal, everyday product.  It is not a packet of crisps.  It is an essential social good that people need to survive.  It is the difference between a child having a normal, decent life where he or she can grow and develop, or sleeping in a car.  It is right that there are restrictions and protections in place because this is not a market like any other.  We are dealing with an essential social good and we must not forget that.<br\/><br\/>We need to address the issue of deposits.  My colleague, Senator Kelleher, has worked very hard on this.  Very sensible amendments were tabled in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  The Minister should reconsider and accept them.  Like other European countries, we need to address the situation whereby landlords demand two or three months' rent upfront as a deposit, which is unacceptable.  The Minister said he agrees in principle that deposits should be capped at one month and that this will be addressed in legislation coming later in the year.  I do not see any good reason it cannot be included here.<br\/><br\/>We can do more on rent transparency.  If we want the rent pressure zones to be effective, tenants need to be able to access a proper register and see the rent increase for properties relative to the previous rent.  I know the Minister is committed to this in principle but apparently there are legal issues.  Could more detail be provided on what the Attorney General has said?  What constitutional or statutory rights would be impacted, especially if efforts were made to make it anonymous?  Does Ireland have stronger rights in this area compared with other countries that stop us from publishing these data?  I am worried that legal advice will take the path of least resistance and tend to be more conservative.  It would be good to get more detail on this point.  These issues could be addressed through amendments.  If the political will is there, we should look for cross-party consensus on common-sense changes that could improve an already strong Bill.<br\/><br\/>I hope to work with the Minister on this.  In general, I welcome the legislation and the protection that it brings.  However, we have to acknowledge that this will not address the root cause of the current crisis.  We read the reports from <i>daft.ie<\/i>and we see how fast rents are rising despite pressure zones.  The fundamental problem is a lack of supply of housing.  Dublin alone needs approximately 80,000 new homes, and reliance on the private sector for construction just will not provide it.  We urgently need the State to invest in social and affordable housing.  The reality is that it is often cheaper to buy a house and pay off the mortgage than it is to rent.  This compounds inequality throughout the country.<br\/><br\/>If one considers two couples at the same stages in their lives with roughly similar but modest incomes, both of them can just about afford to pay the rent each month and then cover other essential expenses such as childcare, healthcare and food.  They are just getting by.  The first couple, however, is lucky enough to have access to cash, whether a loan from their parents or an inheritance.  It means that they can cover a deposit and take out a mortgage.  At this point, the situation starts to change radically.  They now pay &euro;300 or &euro;400 less per month than they would if they were renting, meaning more disposable income every week and the capacity to save.  This money is also going straight into the solid asset that they can keep as opposed to going into the black hole of a landlord's pocket.  It can be recouped to an extent.  Meanwhile, the second couple is stuck despite a similar income and capacity to pay.  The terrible state of the rental market means that they just cannot save because they do not have family wealth.  Getting a deposit is impossible.  They are stuck renting with no real way out of it.  They are left in a precarious position with all the worry and stress that comes with it.  How can a couple raise a young family in that situation?  This is how inequality is compounded in this country and it builds over time.  Our broken housing system makes it worse.  It shuts out those without wealth.<br\/><br\/>If we are serious about fixing this, we need a proper supply of social and affordable housing.  It is not just about scoring political points.  I fully recognise the positive steps taken here but we need to address the root cause.  We need an ambitious programme of investment in social and affordable housing and an end to the reliance on the private sector and the motive of profit to provide.  It is not working and we have to change our thinking about housing.  It is an essential social good, such as education or healthcare.  It is time for the State to step up and ensure that it is provided.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#TT00300","speaker":"1408","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":194,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for the work that he is doing.

The demand for housing poses major challenges in all of the cities throughout the country.  It is important that we get a balance.  I am a legal practitioner and come across issues.  In fairness, as other speakers have said, there are landlords who have provided substandard accommodation, have not been putting in the work to make sure that it is adequate, and have been using it as a means to make the maximum amount of money.

We need to do much more on that.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Colm Burke:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->In many cases, landlords are providing furniture, carpets, curtains and all ancillary services in addition to the house or apartment itself.  We need to move in a direction where maintenance is a shared responsibility between landlord and tenant.  The existing legislation is not adequate in this regard.<\/p><p>The final issue I wish to raise is the situation of landlords whose sole business is letting property.  They do not enjoy the same benefits as anyone else running a business in terms of transferring the property to a family member or selling it.  In fact, they are liable for the full amount of capital gains tax.  If we are not careful, we will end up in a situation where only the bare minimum of work is done on existing rentals.  That is exactly what happened when restricted rent was introduced 40 or 50 years ago, which resulted in a serious deterioration in the condition of rental properties.  We need to find the right balance in this matter.  We must protect tenants, particularly families, and ensure they have adequate notice of having to moving out, but we must also ensure there is a balancing protection for landlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#UU00600","speaker":"1409","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for bringing forward this badly-needed legislation.  I do not intend to delay its progress on Committee or Report Stages but I have submitted some amendments, which I hope the Minister will have time to consider before tomorrow.  One of my concerns relates to the enforcement of short-term lettings.  We must make it as easy as possible for planning enforcement officers in local authorities to deal with that aspect.  The more effectively that we can make it a desktop process, the better.  It is why I am proposing that there be a register to which planning enforcement officers have access.  There may be problems in legislating for this, but I ask the Minister to look closely at it before Committee Stage.  I accept that his intention is not to prevent people from renting a room in their property.  In communities close to my home and that of the Minister, several homes have been transferred to short-term lettings.  With adequate enforcement, we can ensure a good number of units are restored to the long-term market.  My concern is to prevent a hollowing out of communities, which we have seen on the Continent where residential communities close to city centres were turned into holiday villages.  I can name streets in Dublin city centre where that has happened, with families putting their homes up for sale because the location was no longer a residential street but more like a holiday home section of the city.  The relevant provisions in the Bill would be strengthened by considering mechanisms for enforcement and ensuring adequate resourcing for that enforcement.<\/p> <p>I acknowledge the point that there are good and bad tenants and good and bad landlords.  The reality at this time, however, is that the number of people losing their private rental properties and becoming homeless exceeds our capacity to provide housing for them.  It is one of the main reasons for the growth in the homeless list, with people going into a family hub, if they are lucky, or a bed and breakfast or hotel.  In the short term, we need to stem that flow into homelessness by providing adequate protections for people.  Several measures in the Bill are timely and will assist in that regard.  In addition, I would like to see a strengthening of the deposits system, as raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in the D&aacute;il and set out in one of my amendments.<\/p> <p>Another issue with short-term lettings is that the relevant provisions relate only to rent pressure zones.  However, as numerous reports in newspapers and on television have shown, short-term lettings are having an impact well outside those zones.  Workers in places like Dingle and Kinsale, for example, can no longer find somewhere to rent because the properties that were previously available have moved to short-term letting.  That matter must be reviewed.  Fine Gael ideology has it that the market will resolve the housing crisis and we must concentrate on the supply side only and move towards the European rental model.  The problem is that we do not have the underpinning legislation to protect people in rented accommodation in the long term.  If we are moving towards a situation where the vast majority of people rent, our legislation must reflect that by ensuring there is security of tenure.  In fact, it must go even further than that.  If we are telling people in our cities that they will be renting for the rest of their life at a cost of &euro;2,000 per month, what happens when they come to retirement age and experience a drop in income which means they are no longer able to pay that level of rent?  Are we saying that people in their late 60s will have to move to another part of the city or country, away from the communities in which they have lived for 30 or 40 years, because they will otherwise be unable to afford their rent payments?  If that is what we are saying, then we must have full reform of our pensions legislation to ensure people have adequate provision in retirement to be able to afford to rent in the areas in which they have lived all their life.<\/p> <p>It has been noted that the cost of rent is generally higher than the cost of a mortgage.  Under the affordable housing proposals for Dublin, one of the criteria is that a person must be living within the local authority area for the previous 12 months to be eligible to apply.  I know of many families who have had to move out of Dublin city centre because the rent is no longer affordable.  They will not qualify for affordable housing in their own communities if they have been gone for more than a year.  That issue must be reviewed.<\/p> <p>I intend to press five amendments.  I do so not to delay the legislation but with the intention of strengthening it.  I look forward to debating my proposals with the Minister tomorrow.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#VV00200","speaker":"1417"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":201,"content":"<p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  It occurs to me that given where we have been as a country, we should probably come up with an alternative word for \"landlord\".  The debate on this issue tends to get skewed and it seems easier to see it in terms of the responsibility of landlords and to forget that tenants also have responsibilities.  Perhaps \"residential tenancers\" or something like that might be an alternative name for landlords.  We must take seriously the point made by Senator Colm Burke that many of us here may need to declare an interest as being among the 70% of landlords who rent out only one property.  We must consider the common good when considering this issue.  At the same time, most of us, in the course of our work as public representatives, have encountered situations where vulnerable property owners were completely done over by tenants.

As many of us have learned in school, it is interesting that we are still debating fair rent and fixity of tenure for people which is at the heart of this Bill, even more so as we still do not appear to have resolved some of the ideals of Michael Davitt from many decades ago.<\/p> <p>I am disappointed that rent deposit protection schemes to not feature in the Bill.  I know that the Minister has some proposals but it would be useful to have a statement of intent in the Bill and the amendments that we will be tabling will reflect that.<\/p> <p>Deposit retention is one of the primary issues brought to the RTB for dispute resolution.  In 2017, it received 1,234 applications, a rise since 2013, when there were 900 disputes of that type.  While as a percentage the deposit disputes are reducing, they are not doing so in quantum terms.  That is an important area.  When one thinks of deposits, the average national rent is &euro;1,122.  Very often landlords are now looking for deposits of two months' rent, which would be &euro;2,244.  Given the average industrial wage is &euro;38,000, that is a huge proportion of an ordinary person's capital.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendment on that issue which we will table tomorrow.  It is a significant source of dispute for Threshold, where there were 786 queries in 2018.  In each of these scenarios, tenants are highly likely to lose out on the possibility of securing a new home in the private rented sector for the want of a deposit.  The failure to return a deposit can place them at risk of homelessness.  It is a huge amount of money for an ordinary person to put together because usually one has a deposit to make.  If it is two months and a month's rent in advance, that could amount to &euro;3,500.  I do not have that kind of money in my bank account although I am in a good well-paying job and I do not know many people who do.  This should be at the heart of the intent of this Bill.  <\/p> <p>The deposit scheme ensures that a tenant has greater purchasing power and can be more mobile in choosing more suitable accommodation and for work purposes.  This also helps the landlord because while most of the deposit disputes are ruled in favour of the tenant, some are ruled in favour of the landlord.  My niece in-law's father is a landlord in Scotland where such a scheme is in place and he is delighted, as a landlord, for such a scheme to be in place.  One is talking about large amounts of money accumulating.  If one thinks of 339 tenancies, where each of those tenancies were paying a monthly deposit, that amounts to &euro;380,000, and were one to double that to two months' deposit that would amount to &euro;760,000 of an accumulated figure.  As for the potential size of this figure, it was reported in 2012 that &euro;32 million, which had been paid by the Department of Employment and Social Protection in the form of deposits on behalf of rent supplement tenants from 2006, had not been returned to the Department.  It was not known what proportion was kept by tenants and what proportion by landlords.  I ask the Minister to consider our amendment tomorrow to introduce a national deposit scheme.  It is a fundamental piece of security of tenure for tenants.  There are abuses and they are well documented.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#WW01600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I am fascinated that the House is so empty regarding such an extraordinary Bill , one which is terribly needed.

I feel it is a privilege that I can say what I need to, to the Minister, personally, outside of a Senate audience.

I am not pro-landlord because I have spent my life renting, from bedsits to houses to townhouses, and I am still under a vulture fund but I have spoken to landlords and I wonder why they are all leaving if the Bill is so balanced.  Are they all bad, appalling and terrible and all tenants wonderful?  Everything is about getting them.  Is the Bill just based on the rogue landlords and the slum landlords?  I ask the Minister to talk to me about the balance of it.  It seems there is no way to question the Bill in this House because it is to be signed off tomorrow.  Will the fact that landlords are leaving help the overall problem?  I spoke to landlords today who have 20 or 30 properties.  They are good and genuine landlords but they have got out and their properties are now vacant because they do not want to rent them out.  The properties are in rent pressure zones and subject to the 4% limit so it is too problematic to rent them out again, while the fellow next door is renting at twice the amount.<\/p><p>We should go back to the county council house.  People keep talking about the wonderful Mulvey Park in lower Dundrum, which is wonderful county council housing with big greenery in front and in which half the country was reared.  Why can we not have these houses back?  We are legislating ourselves out of business.  Landlords keep on speaking about the substantial renovation definition, which they think is too restrictive.  Property owners' income is also restricted, with no account taken of their indebtedness, ability to pay their outgoings, subsequent devaluation of their property or being forced from the market.  On their introduction, the Government promised the rent pressure zones would be for a maximum of three years but it has now given up on the promise and added two extra years.<\/p><p>I know my area but not as internally as the Minister knows his.  Can he talk to me about landlords who, because of this Bill, will have to rent their property out at a lower rate if tenants leave?  This is what is coming in from them.  One told me if someone owned a petrol station and others charged &euro;1.35 for diesel, if they were obliged to ask only 81 cent they would go out of business very quickly but this is what happens in rent pressure zones.  It is a case of balance.  It is as if there are no laws for the tenant and it is all about the rogue landlord.  Maybe there are hundreds, thousands or millions of them - I do not know because I do not live in that world.<\/p><p>There will be a mixed reaction to this and many landlords will leave because of it.  If somebody rents for a living, as Senator Colm Burke said, they have to make a small profit though I take on board what Senators have said about roguery.  There has to be balance but I do not see that.  It is all about roguery and landlords standing at the gate of hell, ready to get everybody.  This is not true.  Moreover, tenants can be equally roguish, if not more so, so there needs to be some balance.

Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell is correct - it must be about balance and about ensuring the security of the tenant.  The rights of the tenants have to be upheld, and strengthened in some cases, but the same goes for the landlord.  The Minister said 1,700 landlords have left the property market since 2015 and that is a huge number.

One's world view changes as one becomes more knowledgeable and one understands that there is no silver bullet.  I am certain of one thing, however, which is that we need to ensure the affordable housing scheme is opened up and made available to people.  We need to continue to ensure that people have the option to buy and live in their own home.  As I did on the Order of Business this morning, I challenge Members to come down to Cork city to look at the quality of the social housing being constructed there under Rebuilding Ireland and to look at the transformation for people who are now exiting homelessness.

If something is not working, it should be changed.  I will make a few observations.  The rent pressure zones are coming in.  I think everyone accepts that our problem is ultimately one of supply.  If we had sufficient supply, it is probable that we would not need rent pressure zones because the market would stabilise.  Rent pressure zones are based on average figures across electoral areas.  In some cases, there are exceptionally high rents in certain parts of an electoral area and exceptionally low rents in other parts of the same electoral area.  If the average rent in the area is below the national average, it is not designated as a rent pressure zone.  Other electoral areas are more homogenous, which can allow the area to receive such designation.  I appreciate that the Minister has changed the legislation in this area.<\/p><p>All of us are hearing from landlords.  Everyone rents at some stage in his or her life.  I rented for many years.  My wife and I bought our house a number of years after we got married.  That was a standard approach at the time.  What we are talking about is a modern feature.  It is deep in the psyche of Irish people, probably because we were ruled by the British for 800 years, to aspire to own our own homes.  It is deep in our psyche to want our own homes.  Senator McDowell spoke earlier about the Vienna solution.  While I agree that we have to move to looking at the rental model, we cannot get away from the fact that home ownership is deep in our psyche.  That is why it is critical for us to make affordable housing available to people, particularly young people across the social spectrum.  We are moving in that direction.  I have been contacted by young professionals who cannot get mortgages.  A young teacher who came to me told me she cannot qualify for a mortgage even though she is in secure employment.<\/p><p>I think the affordable model is absolutely key.  There are anomalies within the system at the moment.  I will speak about tenants in the first instance.  Rogue landlords can make the lives of their tenants hell by providing substandard accommodation, retaining deposits or engaging in harassment.  Equally, rogue tenants can use deposits as a means of not paying rent.  In such circumstances, the landlord can end up taking the tenant to the RTB and the whole thing can be an unqualified mess.  I have dealt with landlords who have kept their tenants' rents at relatively modest levels.  If a property owned by such a landlord suddenly falls into a rent pressure zone, he or she might end up charging half of the market rent for the area.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#XX00400","speaker":"1374","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":224,"content":"<p>The fellow next door might be paying much more.

Should such a landlord be entitled to charge the new tenant a reasonable market rent?  In many cases, landlords in rent pressure zones hiked up their rents in a way that inadvertently drove up the overall level of rent in the area.  While we are waiting for supply to catch up, we must find a model that enables us to get reasonable rents for people.  An affordable model for people needs to be fast-tracked.  I commend the Minister on his efforts in this regard.<\/p> <p>The Airbnb issue is a tricky and difficult one to deal with.  We cannot have people being fleeced by what is being charged on Airbnb.  People in specific situations might be using Airbnb for no more than a couple of months of the year.  I suggest that reasonable rents and proper rights for tenants are the factors at play here.  When I am contacted by tenants who have received letters from rogue landlords who want to dump them out early, I look at the types of periods to which they are entitled.  If they do not contact me, they are at risk of being put out two or three months early.  Equally, I am contacted by landlords who have rogue tenants.  We need to find that balance all the time.  When the Minister comes up with the detail of the scheme, I expect we will look at it in greater detail.  I know he is open to suggestions.  It is about getting a model that strikes a fair and equitable balance for tenants and landlords and, in particular, ensures people can afford rents.  My background is that I was self-employed for many years. We are dealing with this issue on the ground on a daily basis.  When I was here earlier, I commented to someone sitting beside me that this is a most important debate.  In my view, it is taking place too late at night.  It is highly unlikely that it will get reported.  This is a critical debate.  I commend it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#YY00300","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":226,"content":"<p>I thank everyone for the contributions they have made.  In particular, I thank those who stayed after they spoke to engage in the debate.  When I asked the Chair if there was a time limit on my response, he said \"No.\"  I am very sorry if I go on too long because I know people have had a long day.  When I speak in this Chamber, I like to go through each Senator's contribution and respond in turn to what he or she has said.  On this occasion, I propose to speak thematically on each of the issues that have been raised.  I am trying to be a bit more efficient.<\/p> <p>I spoke at the outset about the urgency with which we are dealing with these issues.  I have asked the House to do something special with regard to the amount of time we spend debating this Bill in order that we can see it through this week.  This is important not because I want to stifle debate or restrict the potential for further reforms, but because I am conscious that the Bill has already been delayed, unfortunately, through circumstances outside my control.  The Government does not control this House.  We wanted to put additional things in the Bill that were not in it initially to extend the rent pressure zones, change the qualifying criteria, lengthen notice periods and regulate short-term letting.  I will go into the details of those changes in due course.  The key thing is that we were meant to commence the new laws on short-term letting, which will allow for home-sharing while clamping down on short-term letting for tourism purposes, on 1 June next.  As a result of the delays I have mentioned, it is now intended that the new laws will be commenced on 1 July.  Given that we are now in the month of May, I am worried that if this Bill does not conclude in this House this week, I will not be able to come back to this House with the regulations next week.  I want this legislation to come into law by the beginning of June to provide a four-week period to people in this situation.  They have already had more than enough time.  To be fair, they have known this was coming since October.  There will have to be time to put public notices in the newspapers in order that this can happen on 1 July.  We do not want to lose that date again.  That is why I have looked for this to happen quickly.  I appreciate the frustration this has caused for Senators.  We have debated this issue in the House on numerous occasions.  This is a very important Bill.  I have already examined the amendments in detail.  I have listened carefully this evening.  I will go through every piece of this Bill with Senators tomorrow.  I hope the Seanad will provide time to get this done this week.  That will allow me to get this legislation to the President for signature, get the commencement done, start with the regulations and come back with the short-term lettings regulations.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell may have misinterpreted Senator Mullen's remarks.  I do not think he was talking about 70% of Senators being landlords.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#YY00400","speaker":"1295"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":227,"content":"<p>I think he was.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#YY00500","speaker":"1427"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":228,"content":"<p>The 70% figure relates to those landlords who own just one property.  I think that is what Senator Mullen meant.  His point was that most landlords in this country own just one property.  He was commenting on how we talk about landlords.  Maybe this relates to the points that have been made about the Irish psyche.  Perhaps the word \"landlord\" has a connotation that does not apply to landlords in this country.  Some 70% of them own just one property and 16% of them own just two properties.  Some 86% of landlords own just one or two properties.  As a result of the financial crash, many of our landlords are accidental landlords.  They never wanted to be landlords.  They bought properties at the wrong point in the market and when their employment or family circumstances changed, they acquired a second property.  When we talk about landlords, we have to be careful not to treat them like demons or like the caricatures we have seen in films, plays or books in the past.  Of course some rogues exist.<\/p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell spoke about whether the Bill is balanced.  In and of itself, it is not.  As a Bill, it is there to bring new protections for tenants and to try to bring balance to our rental sector as a whole.  It recognises that there are rogue landlords who should not be called \"landlords\" because they are abusing human rights.  They should not be called \"landlords\" because that is not what they are.  Some of the things that people are doing when it comes to accommodation standards, overcrowding and everything else falls more into the space of people trafficking.  We need to make sure we can get them properly and get them good, in order that their cases will act as a disincentive to others who might try to take advantage of the system.<\/p> <p>We recognise that we are in a period of transformation.  We are moving from a rental sector that is not modern, European or functional to one that is more modern and European and meets the expectations of a new generation.  That is challenging at a time of supply difficulties.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->On the specific point regarding balance, there is an imbalance of power at the moment for tenants who have a problem with their property and who want to make a complaint.  They can run into difficulties with their landlords and find themselves getting a notice to quit.  That is why we have given the RTB the power to make an independent inspection without tenants having to make a complaint.  Tenants will also be able to make a complaint anonymously.  We are giving powers to them that they did not have previously, but which they should have, because their position is more precarious than that of the landlord given the property is their primary residence.  <br\/><br\/>Landlords are leaving the market and I have been warning about this for two years, since I became Minister.  I look at the data.  I am criticised all of the time for looking at and speaking to data but they tell us what is happening.  More than a year ago I said, on the basis of what the data were telling us about planning permission applications, commencement notices and completions, that the increase in house prices would slow and prices would fall.  That is exactly what we are seeing now.  Due to rent caps, we are also seeing this in rent pressure zones, albeit not as quickly as we should.  Recent data from the RTB showed rents falling for the first time.  The <i>daft.ie<\/i>report is from one company and is based on advertised rents rather than on rents agreed.  It also uses a very small dataset but even that report is showing that things are not moving as quickly as they were before the crisis.  That is important because it tells us that there is some progress.  Of course, it also tells us that rents are too high and that we need to do more, which is exactly why this Bill is so important.  <br\/><br\/>Some landlords are leaving the market because they were accidental landlords in the first place and because house prices have recovered.  While they have not reached peak level - they are still 20% below that - house prices have recovered enough to enable some to get out of the landlord game.  Some landlords are leaving the market because they have had a negative experience, with tenants not paying their rents.  They cannot afford to carry that and so rather than trying to fix that, they have decided to get out of the market.  Some landlords are leaving simply because of changed circumstances in their own lives.  What this speaks to is some of the dysfunction of the market whereby our rental sector is dependent on small landlords.  A full 86% of landlords only own one or two properties which makes the sector very volatile, given how things can change in an individual's life.  <br\/><br\/>We want to find a balance.  We want to have landlords coming into the market and making a long-term commitment of at least 20 to 30 years.  That is what we want because then we can secure long-term leases.  While people like to criticise large institutional investors, it must be acknowledged that what they bring to the sector is a commitment to rent a property for a long time.  Furthermore, because they are often publicly listed companies and have shareholders, they cannot even try to break the law.  They cannot go anywhere near the temptation to which some individual landlords might succumb because they have a responsibility to their boards, shareholders or parent corporation.  That is not to say that all of these large companies are angels.  That is why for the first time, through this legislation, we are bringing these large landlords into the scope of the rent pressure zone regulations.  That is why the Minister for Finance and I have said that we will examine the tax treatment of these entities to make sure that any entity in the rental sector is operating under fair regulation and is compliant with the tax code.  <br\/><br\/>We are trying to provide more balance and stability in the rental sector in the context of landlords.  We know from the data that large institutional investors comprise a small percentage of the rental sector.  Only 1% of transactions in 2017 involved large institutional investors.  We are keeping an eye on this but we know that if we want to remove some of the volatility in the market, particularly over the past ten years, we will need more of the larger, long-term players.  Benefits come with that.  We want to manage the benefits and embrace the upside while minimising any potential downsides that might arise.  One of the things we did for landlords in this year's budget was fast-track the reintroduction of 100% mortgage interest relief.  It had been cut because of the crash.  We said we would bring it back and we did it more quickly than initially intended because we recognise that landlords, if they are to remain in the market, need to be able to make enough money to at least cover the management of the property properly and to make a profit.  I am not talking about a super profit but why would landlords take the risk of investing and why would we even ask them to do so if there was not going to be some return?  We must remember that we cannot force people to be landlords.  As more landlords leave the sector, our challenge in respect of people in housing insecurity and at risk of homelessness increases.  That is why this all comes back to the crucial word which many Senators have used - balance.  <br\/><br\/>We are bringing forward this Bill to ensure balance in the sector.  It has 38 sections that are supportive of tenants because there is a lack of balance in the market at the moment.  However, this is not one piece of work that will do the job.  Of course, we will not all go home tonight and say that we have fixed the rental sector.  That is why I also mentioned a second rent Bill that will be presented for pre-legislative scrutiny in the fourth quarter of this year.  If I can, I would like to commence that legislation in the Seanad.  I gave a commitment a number of weeks ago in this House that I would seek to commence more legislation in the Seanad which is only fair, given the time this House has given to rental measures.  That is what I would like to do with that Bill later this year.  It will deal with issues raised by Senators, which are not addressed in the Bill before us today.  <br\/><br\/>The deposit protection scheme was a significant issue in 2014 and 2015 but deposit problems have fallen down the list of complaints received by the RTB.  It was becoming less of a priority but, at the same time, we were seeking to bring forward priority legislation that would have the greatest support in the House and would move through the legislative process quickly-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#YY00600","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":230,"content":"<p>The proportion of complaints has reduced but not the actual number-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#ZZ00200","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>We are acting on the advice of the RTB in terms of what is a priority for the first Bill and what can wait until the second Bill.  The issue of deposits was high up on the list a few years ago but has fallen.  That is not to say that we will fail to deal with it but, in the interim, something else has happened which is interesting.  The interest market has gone in a different direction.  The Senator quoted figures for the money that might be involved in a deposit protection scheme.   The record might show that she referred to thousands of euro but we are talking about more than &euro;330 million that would have to be managed in a deposit protection scheme.  That is the equivalent of a bank.  The RTB cannot manage that money.  Who is going to manage it?  That needs to be decided.  Then we need to decide who is going to resolve deposit disputes and to make sure that it is done quickly.  I am a former renter and I know that people need a deposit back from one property to secure the next one.  That is not going to be possible if people are waiting for four weeks or more to get their deposits back.  We need to make sure that when a deposit protection scheme is introduced, it will cover its own costs and will not involve an additional cost for the tenant or the landlord.  It must also be efficient when it comes to releasing the money.  We must determine who is going to manage the money and resolve any disputes.  I have committed to bringing a report to the House shortly on how such a scheme might work.<\/p> <p>On the question of the definition of a deposit, there was a lot of talk recently about landlords looking for two months' rent as a deposit but the RTB has said that it is not receiving many complaints in that regard.  A deposit should be one month's rent and no more.  If we are going to define that in legislation, we need to make sure that we are closing all of the loopholes so that landlords do not simply ask for one month's deposit and two month's rent up front.  What if a landlord wants to charge an additional deposit because a tenant is bringing in a couple of pets?  How do we capture these issues while remaining fair and balanced?  We can do all of this.  It is not rocket science but it just was not ready for this legislation.  We must also recognise the new proposals that have been included in the Bill only recently, including the extension of the RPZs, the closing of loopholes and the actions on short-term letting.  These were not in the Bill initially and have only been introduced in the past month or two because they were deemed to be a priority.  It is not that we do not want to do something on deposits; rather we are teeing that up for the next rental Bill.  <\/p> <p>On short-term letting, our aim is to protect home sharing because the sharing economy is fantastic when it works well.  People who have their own home and who want to go on holidays with their family for two weeks decide to let their property out to someone else while they are away.  The money they make from doing that will meet some of the cost of their own holiday and why not?  Others might have a spare room in their house and decide to let it out during the year, when it suits them.  That helps with mortgage repayments or some other expense and, again, why not?  We are going to allow home sharing to happen where it is the owner's residence.  We are going to allow it all year round when it is just a room in the owner's residence.  If the owner is leaving the residence to home share, there is a cap of 90 days.  If it is a second property and it is in a rent pressure zone, then I am sorry but that cannot happen any more.  The reason we have rent pressure zones is that there is such a high demand for rental accommodation among people living and working in the area and that has to be our priority.  While we have to be concerned about tourists and where they are going to stay, as was pointed out here today, thousands of new hotel rooms are being built at the moment.  The other parts of our country where short-term letting is the only tourist accommodation available will not be affected.  This is linked to the RPZs because the legal advice is that we had to link it to something that shows that there is pressure on rental accommodation.  We had RPZs in legislation so that is what we have done.  I recognise, as Senator Humphreys said, that parts of the country are not in RPZs but there is pressure on rental accommodation there.  However, I had to work within the framework of the legal advice I was given.  Senators asked about that legal advice and how it was tested.  I have been back and forth with the Attorney General time and again on this legislation as it evolved.  This relates to the issue of rent transparency as well, on which amendments have also been tabled.  I wanted rent transparency at the individual property level.  That was my ambition.  As we progressed, I received varied advice on this and went back and forth on it.<!--\/p--><!--p><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288\"><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=14\"><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->I was told that we could not do it at the level of the individual house, so we have been identifying where we can do it in legislation at aggregate level, whether that is by street or other area.  The building of an annual rent registration capability, which is so important to understand what is happening in our rental sector, will allow us to do that.  That will come, but not at the level that I would like.  Had we included it, the risk of the legislation crashing on the rocks at a later stage was too great.  It would have been unwise to risk it over that issue given everything else that the Bill is trying to do.<\/p><p>I understand what people have heard from some people about substantial refurbishment and we are looking at this.  We do not want to deter people from investing in their properties.  However, we want to ensure that, where they do so and look to get outside the rent caps in place, they have made a proper investment.  They may have increased the floor space of the property to allow for a larger kitchen or playroom because there is a family in the house.  They may have allowed for disability access or increased the building energy rating.  There is good news on the climate front as well if we can do that.  There are other things we can do under our housing policy and planning policy.  We can improve the community and our impact on the environment and the climate as well.<\/p><p>Tenancy termination periods are being lengthened significantly.  This will be of greater security to tenants who might be at risk of homelessness.<\/p><p>Why is so much student accommodation being built?  It is built to a lower standard than homes and apartments because students do not need the accommodation size that a family or a young professional couple might need and because they enjoy more social spaces.  Normal rental accommodation could not be built to that standard and that is why it is going up so quickly.  It is needed but, as it happens, it takes pressure off other parts of the rental sector.  Three students will no longer rent an apartment in the IFSC.  They will go into student accommodation and free up the other accommodation, hopefully, for people working in the IFSC or those who want to live there.  That is only one example.  Six students might have rented a house in Cabra.  They will no longer need to rent a house there because there is now student accommodation and that house will be freed up for a family or for professionals working in the area.  Student accommodation is being covered under the rent pressure zone legislation in terms of the inflation that is allowed.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the Irish psyche and ownership.  That may be true but perhaps that is changing as well.  The most important issue is that we have choice.  Young people starting off now will work in many different jobs in different countries.  They do not necessary think that home ownership is for them in the next five or ten years.  They need to have flexibility and choice.  Unfortunately, there are people today who were not able to buy a house at a different stage in their life for whatever reason and who are approaching retirement age.  Their means of income will be limited to their pension.  They need to be able to rent in a secure way for five, ten, 15 or 20 years.  They need to know that their pension will not be simply bulldozed by unsustainable rent increases.<\/p><p>As we bring about rental sector changes and more choice we have to bring about certain key measures.  We talk about a more modern mature rental sector, a more European-style rental sector, more choice and more balance but what do we mean.  We mean increased supply.  We have made changes to regulations and planning permission is being approved for thousands of apartments.  We mean far better standards, but also different standards depending on the type of accommodation being rented.  We mean cost rental accommodation.  This means guaranteed below-market rent for a significant period.  That is the Vienna model.  It works in other cities and it can work here.  We also mean affordability not only for those getting below-market rent but also people having some certainty or stability around what kind of rent increase they might accept.  Only four years ago rent controls were unthinkable in Irish politics.  A year after that, we introduced them.  Three years later, we are extending, deepening and improving them.  The public attitude to housing and how it should be provided is changing.  I believe the Oireachtas is responding, although it can never respond quickly enough.  Anyway, I believe we are now starting to understand that we have a different type of responsibility from that we might have had in the past.  While  we recognise our responsibility to people who are most vulnerable and who need our help the most - that is why we have the provision of social housing - it is not enough to say that one person is entitled to social housing and will get the support but that if another person is not entitled, he or she gets nothing.  We recognise now that there is another cohort of people who are working but who also need support with affordable rents or affordable homes to buy.  These are the moves we are now making under Rebuilding Ireland.<\/p><p>The modern rental sector also requires security, longer leases and longer notice-to-quit periods.  It requires moving to tenancies of indefinite duration.  The next Bill will address this and incentivise landlord and tenants to enter into three, five and ten-year lease agreements.  What people do not seem to understand is that if parties have a three-year lease agreement today, it cannot be broken because the landlord wants to move back in with notice to quit.  He or she has to observe that lease agreement.  We want more of these in the sector, not less.  We also want stability in supply, which we have not had, unfortunately, in recent years.  We want stability in affordability and price too, something we have not had either.  We are building all these components.  When we have them we will improve circumstances for tenants and landlords alike.<\/p><p>In combination with all of that, we are in the middle of a change management programme with the RTB, moving it from being a board to an independent regulator with all the powers it needs to properly and robustly defend the rights of tenant and landlord alike.  That is the kind of vision we are aiming for.<\/p><p>I thank Senators for their time and for staying to listen to me respond.  I look forward to the engagement we will have on the amendments tomorrow.  I appreciate the fact that Senators are giving this special attention this week, which is important.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#ZZ00300","speaker":"1295","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557840600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>Question put and agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557840600,"counter":234,"content":"<p>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 15 May 2019.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>When is it proposed to sit again?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#AAA00400","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1557840600,"counter":236,"content":"<p>Maidin am&aacute;rach ar 10.30.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2019051400002#AAA00500","speaker":"1391"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1557840600,"counter":237,"content":"<p>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 May 2019.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
