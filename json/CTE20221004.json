I am executive director of Electric Ireland, which is the retail division of the ESB.  I am joined by two colleagues.  Suzanne Ward is on my right and David Vickers is on my left.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on three areas.  First, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s role as a supplier in the Irish electricity market; second, I will summarise why electricity prices have increased over the past 18 months, and third, I will detail how Electric Ireland is supporting our customers during these challenging times.  In addition, as requested by the committee, I will briefly cover ESB Group's profitability as set out in our recently published interim results for the half-year to 30 June 2022.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 2.2 million residential electricity customers in the Republic of Ireland.  Electric Ireland, as Ireland&rsquo;s largest electricity supplier, has in the region of 1.1 million residential electricity customers and 170,000 residential gas customers.  Electric Ireland also serves the SME and large energy user segments of the market, with an overall market share across the residential and business segments of approximately 40%.<\/p> <p>  The ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately so that increased profits from the ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  This means that Electric Ireland must operate in the residential market as an entirely stand-alone supplier, buying electricity and gas from the wholesale market to meet customer demand.<\/p> <p>  Turning to price increases, the electricity price for customers is made up of wholesale electricity costs, network or infrastructure costs, government policy regarding public service obligation, PSO, charges, VAT and the costs associated with operating as a supplier in the market.  Over the past year, the significant increases in customers&rsquo; bills have been driven by extraordinary and sustained increases in the wholesale price of electricity.  Such increases in Ireland have been driven primarily by unprecedented increases in wholesale gas prices in Britain and across the EU, driven by concerns over European gas supply, made much more acute as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and reduced Russian gas supply.  Wholesale gas forward prices have increased by more than 1,000% over the past 18 months.  This is an unprecedented level of increase.  Two years ago, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s annual wholesale energy costs were in the region of &euro;300 million.  At current market levels, we expect that cost to increase to around &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  Electric Ireland hedges its wholesale costs to remove uncertainty and to stabilise retail prices for our customers.  We typically begin hedging about 18 to 24 months before delivery, and progressively increase our hedge position over time.  This approach protects our customers from short-term volatility by smoothing out cost movements over time.  In more normal wholesale conditions, this approach would be expected to result in small price adjustments, either increases or decreases, depending on the market movements each year.  In conditions where the wholesale market sustains at extraordinary levels, however, retail prices will eventually trend upwards as hedges expire and suppliers have to buy or hedge future purchases of electricity at prevailing elevated prices.<\/p><p>Hedging is the reason residential customer prices have increased gradually over a number of iterations rather than in sudden changes that reflect the real-time volatile nature of the wholesale energy market.<\/p><p> I will now talk about Electric Ireland's pricing and customer protection activities in this difficult period.  Electric Ireland is very aware that these price increases are difficult for customers to absorb.  We are committed to helping our customers during these challenging times.  We have maintained a lower standard variable tariff, SVT, for electricity than almost all competitors across the past 18 months.  We continue to offer enduring discounts for all existing customers.  Electric Ireland engages with any residential customers who have difficulty paying their bills and, where required, works with them to put in place manageable payment plans.  Disconnections are, and always will be, a last resort.  There is a regulatory moratorium on disconnections for the winter period for vulnerable customers.<\/p><p> We are also active in providing more specific targeted supports for our most vulnerable customers.  Electric Ireland recently launched another hardship fund of &euro;3 million, similar to the one in place during Covid, which will provide support to Electric Ireland customers who have difficulty paying their bills.  Access and administration of the fund and issuance of energy credits will be managed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  A range of products is also available through home electric+ for those with smart meters installed.  Detailed appliance insights, user data, and accurate monthly billing can all help customers to manage their energy consumption.  Electric Ireland is running extensive advertising campaigns profiling the benefits of smart metering to customers.<\/p><p> Electric Ireland is the designated supplier of last resort for electricity customers and has been instructed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to take on the customers of Bright Energy, Iberdrola and, more recently, Panda Power, all of which have exited the market.  This has significant implications for Electric Ireland, not least having to buy additional energy for these customers at current market prices.  However, we will endeavour to make this transition as easy as possible for customers.<\/p><p> Electric Ireland has always sought to deliver affordable electricity to all customers in Ireland.  The price increases we have had to announce over the past 18 months have been as a direct consequence of the unprecedented increases in international wholesale gas prices.  As we operate as a stand-alone energy supplier in the market, we have no choice but to increase our prices given the quantum of increase in our costs.<\/p><p> The ESB's generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from the ESB's generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  However, group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Electric Ireland will continue to work with customers who are most challenged by these increases.<\/p><p> I will move on to the additional question on ESB Group profits.  I can talk about the published ESB Group financial results, however I am not in a position to discuss specific generation or network issues, other than as published or in the public domain.  The most accurate representation of the ESB's underlying financial performance during the first half of 2022 is the operating profit before exceptional items.  In the first half of 2022 this was &euro;357 million, which compares with an operating profit of &euro;363 million in the first half of 2021.<\/p><p> The ESB has recorded exceptional gains in the first half of 2022.  These gains relate mainly to the technical accounting treatment of financial instruments, for example, mark to market on commodity hedges, and are not cash-related items.  These non-cash gains are not related to the price paid for electricity by customers.<\/p><p> The ESB has more than &euro;17 billion in assets and &euro;5.8 billion of debt.  The company must earn an appropriate level of profit, so that it can service debt, reinvest in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Over the past ten years, the ESB has invested more than &euro;10 billion in energy infrastructure and paid more than &euro;1.2 billion in dividends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Fenlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fenlon for his statement.

For context, that equates to &euro;2 million per day, or &euro;14 million this week alone, in profits.  During the course of this session, lasting a couple of hours, we are probably talking about profits running into the hundreds of thousands of euro.  Nevertheless, customers' bills are soaring.  Domestic customers have utility bills this month that are skyrocketing; they are doubling and sometimes trebling.  Business consumers and customers with Electric Ireland have bills that are increasing threefold or sometimes fourfold.  These are unprecedented increases in utility prices.  Does Mr. Fenlon accept how difficult it is for these customers to understand or accept that the blow of these prices cannot be cushioned because of technical accounting or because ESB Group is looking at financing future infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#G00500","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We understand that this is a very difficult time for many of our customers who have significant difficulty paying the increased bills.  We are engaging daily with customers who are in difficulty and working with them to help them deal with those increases by putting in place payment plans.  We understand, therefore, that when people hear those profit numbers, they can be difficult to reconcile.  The ESB, as a State-owned company, pays half of its profits back to the State, between a dividend policy of 40% and tax, while the other half funds investment in energy infrastructure, which is critical to delivering not just reliable electricity supply but also the net-zero transition into the future for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the scale of the company, we have &euro;17 billion in assets.  The profit at an operating level is similar to that in the half-year period for last year.  From a competitive point of view, our prices - we have continued to try to offer prices that are as competitive as we can - and our standard variable tariffs have tended to be at the lower end of available prices for the past 18 months.<\/p> <p>  We understand the difficulty for customers .

I also want to ask the witnesses about Electric Ireland's customer outreach and whether as an essential service provider, not just a market provider, they think it is effective.  How does Electric Ireland measure customer reaction to its outreach activities?  Has it had any issues identifying vulnerable customers?  Does its outreach involve collaboration with the HSE regarding how to identify vulnerable customers because there are so many of them who are not registered with their provider?  Has Electric Ireland looked at the possibility of issuing monthly bills?  People on low incomes are telling me that they would find it so much easier if they had monthly bills.

My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, quite correctly pointed out the disparity between Electric Ireland's profits and its hardship fund.  As a State-owned company that is giving back all the profits to the State in the first place, for reinvestment by the State, it is necessary to highlight that &euro;3 million is a drop in the ocean and consideration should be given to increasing that fund.  That should be done promptly.<\/p> <p>  I want to know the answers to some technical questions on the overall price of the product Electric Ireland is offering, both gas and electricity.  Has it worked out the impact of the proposal to decouple the gas market from the electricity market and what impact that might have on its customers?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the variable, that is, the standing charge that goes from company to company across gas and electricity.  As we found out recently, these are not determined by the CRU.  They are in fact determined by individual companies.  In that sense, again, as a State-owned company, consideration should be given to standardising that charge, lowering it or eradicating it.  That would show to Irish consumers that, as a State entity, Electric Ireland is only interested in supplying a product, whether it is electricity or gas, with the State in mind.  Of course, profits will be made.  I am not suggesting that the standing charge is the basis for the company's profit; it is not.  On that basis, consideration should be given to it.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the CRU proposal for peak-time rates, that is, charges would be increased from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and lowered for the rest of the day as a result.

In supplying electricity there is a mixture of fixed costs, including some of the infrastructure costs, as well as costs in running the supply business.  There are also variable costs which is purely the amount consumed.  So there is a mix and there is always a balance between the best way to recover fixed costs versus variable costs.  Our total cost that we recover through customers does not change.  If one goes up, the other will go up by less.   On a combined basis it does not change the amount in terms of the estimated annual bill.  It does vary so if we reduce the standing charge, some customers will benefit for example people with holiday homes which is low usage.  On the other hand other people, who have high volume consumption, particularly families, would pay more if we ended up putting up the unit rate and reducing the standing charge.  There are balancing factors to consider what is the right mix and relative to the market, we have tended to be mid-range as regards of the standing charges that are currently out there in the marketplace.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Vickers to answer the other two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Fenlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Will Mr. Fenlon outline for us what can be done, beyond this &euro;3 million fund, which is really a pittance compared to the challenge that people are facing.  What can be done to protect all of those in vulnerable circumstances?  What can Electric Ireland do to alert its customers to the fact that they can register their vulnerability and, therefore, will be guaranteed that they will not be cut off.

I missed the first couple of speakers and apologise if I cover similar ground.  I return to the hardship fund, which my colleagues have had questions on.  Mr. Fenlon points to the mitigation measures which are in place for vulnerable customers such as the &euro;3 million hardship fund but separately, he mentions that within the broader regulatory framework, the generation and supply aspects of the ESB must be kept separate.  Does that same regulatory separation apply in terms of profits?  To be clear, in the first half of this year ESB had a profit of &euro;679 million.  I join my colleagues in questioning whether there is a regulatory obstacle to it but after today's contributions and the scepticism around the &euro;3 million figure compared to the broader profits, will Electric Ireland now consider increasing that figure of &euro;3 million?<\/p> <p>  In July, it was announced that the standing charge would increase by 11.35%.  My colleague Senator Higgins had exchanges with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities last week and was told that the basis for the standing charge was a socialisation cost and that the regulator stated that where homes are connected to the network, there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers that must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even when the customers use very little electricity such as in a holiday home or because they have upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else.  Perhaps some use solar or photovoltaic, PV, power for their electricity during the day but still require electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation cost, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their homes are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  The increase to the standing charge on your customers' bills does not differentiate nor socialise costs.  Disadvantaged households are facing the same increase.  What is the basis for the increase in the standing charge, in particular with regard to how the regulator describes what such charges should be used for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#O01100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>If I understand correctly, the Senator asked a question about regulatory separation of profits; about the size of the &euro;3 million fund; and about standing charges.

As for the &euro;3 million fund, a number of people have commented on it and we will keep that under review. It is effectively the second &euro;3 million to be put in place.

As mentioned, our bills structure has a fixed component as a standing charge and a variable component which is a unit rate.

Perhaps the Senator is referring to our prior price increase, where we increased both the standing charge and the unit rate.  We did that when we assessed the quantum of costs that we were trying to recover.  We decided that it was a better allocation of those costs to put some of it on the standing charge and less of it on the unit rate.  It does not go to generate any extra net revenue for us as a business.

Does the reason for this relate to general data protection regulation, GDPR, restrictions, and have our guests spoken to the Data Protection Commissioner to see whether there are ways in which, during a crisis of this nature, we can get round some of those GDPR restrictions that might be in place?  It is in all of our interests that people have the opportunity not only to reduce their bills but also to switch their electricity use to the time when renewables are on the system.<\/p> <p>  The ESB is significantly increasing its daytime rate for those who use smart meter charges and the very low rate applies at between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.  It is difficult for consumers to regulate their consumption to have peaks between those hours.  Can it be made a little more user-friendly, perhaps even by changing the times in order that when there is plenty of renewable energy, the company will not charge consumers an excessive rate?

It has increased over the past while, so a briefing note on it would be most welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to an issue also raised by my colleague, Senator Dooley, namely, that of customers being told to use appliances at off-peak times - we have seen those rates increase over the past while - and what was said about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. being the hours for the cheapest rates for some of the tariffs Electric Ireland is offering.  That has, for example, implications for multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, where everyone is running machines.  We then get complaints regarding noise.  We obviously have to consider more social hours.  However, people who are trying their best to consume less energy, and at the most beneficial times as regards charges, feel snookered right now because they are being told to use energy off peak but off-peak rates are going up at a rate of knots.  I ask for an answer to that.<\/p> <p>  I note that &euro;3 million has been set aside for the hardship fund.  How many customers does Electric Ireland expect to avail of that?  The company has earmarked that amount.  It would be interesting to hear what its expectation is in that regard.

I am joined by Mr. Joe Duignan, the regulation and commercial manager for ESB Networks.  We welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee about our central role in facilitating the transition to a net-zero society and achieving the targets set out in the Government's climate action plan.<\/p><p>This is a time of significant concern for both industrial and domestic customers, with large increases in the cost of electricity and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, together with concerns about security of supply.  It is more important than ever that Ireland accelerates its climate action response and achieves improved energy security based on a low-carbon energy system.<\/p><p> I am briefly going to explain ESB Networks&rsquo; role in the electricity sector and then I will cover a few key points on renewable connections.  In our submission we also included a few summary points on the national smart metering programme and our national networks local connections programme.  Both of these programmes are building blocks for the energy transition and the electrification of heat and transport but in the interest of time I do not plan to cover them in this introduction, although I am happy to take any questions on them from members.<\/p><p> I mention the role of ESB Networks.  ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network.  We also build and maintain the electricity transmission network, the planning and operation of which is the responsibility of EirGrid.  Since 1999, these licensed activities have been overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  ESB Networks is a ring-fenced part of ESB Group and there is strict regulatory separation between ESB Networks and the areas of ESB Group responsible for generating and selling electricity.  ESB Networks has served all electricity customers for 95 years and we have a proud history of delivery and innovation.  We work every day to deliver electricity safely and reliably to all customers, irrespective of who they buy their electricity from.  We provide a 24-7 emergency response.  During outages in severe weather, our crews work to restore electricity to affected areas as soon as is it is safe to do so.<\/p><p> We have approximately 2.4 million customers and to give a scale of the network we have: 158,000 km of overhead lines; 27,000 km of underground cables; and 670 high-voltage substations.  Approximately 30,000 new customers connect to the network every year.  The CRU approves the electricity network investment and operation expenditure through five-year contracts called price reviews.  ESB Networks invested &euro;5.3 billion over the past decade and during the period of the price review from 2021 to 2025, which is Price Review 5, we plan to invest &euro;4.4 billion in electricity infrastructure.  Each year our investment programme is delivered through our 3,400 employees and specialist contractors, and is supported by a global supply chain.<\/p><p> I will move to ESB Networks and climate action.  The electricity distribution system is evolving to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030.  The electrification of heat, transport and our economy will see citizens and businesses adopting low carbon technologies, including heat pumps, electric vehicles, and microgeneration such as roof top solar.  ESB Networks is at the centre of the transition to a low carbon energy society, and we are proud of our leading role in this transformation.  In fully supporting the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, ESB Networks has delivered all our lead actions to date and we are supporting the progress and delivery of many other actions.<\/p><p> I will make some final comments on connecting renewables to the electricity network.  Ireland and ESB Networks have a strong track record in connecting renewables.  Today there are over 5 GW of renewable generation connected to the electricity system.  We expect to have connected 25 new grid-scale renewable wind and solar projects during 2022, increasing the total to 5.4 GW.  A further four battery energy storage projects are also expected to be connected, totalling 80 MW.  The combination of the Government&rsquo;s renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the regulated connection process is delivering a strong pipeline of projects each year.  These are essential to ensure a steady drumbeat of projects connecting to the system each year between now and 2030 in order to reach the climate action plan targets.  ESB Networks will continue to work in partnership with generators and all key stakeholders to ensure delivery of these targets.<\/p><p> Since 2011, electricity network generators have the option to build their grid connections, except for specific works that ESB Networks must carry out, such as work in live electricity substations.  This gives generators control and choice over who builds their grid connection.  When customers choose ESB Networks to connect a generator to the system, we design the minimum technically acceptable connection method.  Our charges are benchmarked and are approved by the CRU.  Costs vary depending on the upgrade works required.  Regulated charging policy requires that the cost of upgrade works to the network is borne by the generator.<\/p><p> I will finish with some of the recent key achievements in this area.  The year 2022 is likely to be a record year for renewable generation growth, with approximately 700 MW of new renewable generation expected to be connected, bringing the total to 5.4 GW.  We are processing in the region of 90 grid-scale connection projects every year.  These include commercial solar and wind projects, community projects and auto-producers.<\/p><p>We have also put systems in place to allow for electricity suppliers to settle energy payments for microgeneration electricity exported to the grid.  Over 40,000 microgeneration customers are now registered with ESB Networks and we expect many more to do so over the coming years.  In December 2021, in line with the climate action plan of 2021, CAP 21, we launched the mini-generation pilot for connections of less than 50 kW.  We have since extended this to 650 applications.  Last week, we were very pleased to launch a small-scale generation pilot for connections between 50 kW and 200 kW.<\/p><p> In summary, there has been very significant progress in the growth and deployment of renewables and the initial stages of the electrification of heating and transport.  The collective challenge now is to build on the very positive progress to date and to achieve the targets in the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, and beyond that to net zero.  We are happy to take any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Tarrant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tarrant.

Sometimes people put it all in one pot.  For the electrical grid connection, as Mr. Tarrant said, the contestability is there.  Customers have been able to elect to do it for the past ten years or more.  The way we do our element is by having what is called \"least-cost technically acceptable\".  We do a technically acceptable method, which is carried out by our planners and specialists, and there are planning standards that are approved by the regulator for that.  We look for the minimum technically acceptable level.  We are not looking for the Rolls-Royce model here.  We are looking for something that works and is safe for people on the network and other users.  Once we have designed that, there is a charge associated with it.  The regulator's policy is that the generator who drives the work pays for it.  Otherwise, it would have to be socialised across other customers and that is not a decision for networks.  That cost is there.  Our generator standard charges were benchmarked internationally with consultants and the regulator.  They are benchmarked with the UK distribution network operators, DNOs, and they come out favourably.  There is consultation by the regulator on this where the industry can put in its charges and compare.

With a high demand period over the winter one tends to minimise outages, which can have an impact as to when one can connect or do work on the transmission system or even the distribution system.  We view the transmission outage programme as a window over the spring, through the summer and into the autumn.  A huge amount of work is still done during the winter period.

Earlier we heard that CRU approved these regulated charges so Electric Ireland plays no role in them.  The network charges have increased so has that been the driver of increased standing charges?  Can the ESB show the network charge on the bills provided to consumers so that they feel there is some element of the increase, which they may have to pay, in terms of the charge for running the network?<\/p> <p>  Does the ESB think that energy companies can do more to make it easier for consumers to opt for solar energy, smart technology, insulation, sharing platforms or electric vehicles?  Can more be done?  We seem to have reached a moment when customers are under a lot of pressure and companies like the ESB need consumer goodwill to roll out infrastructure worth &euro;4.4 billion.  The ESB has a perfect opportunity to step up to the plate and say, \"we are going to help a national energy resilience campaign and help our customers\".  If that were done it would result in a win-win situation because people would see the benefits of having more renewables on the system and allowing networks to be built.  We have heard elsewhere that planning objections have been a big drag on the ESB's system.  This is a moment when the ESB could do a very positive thing that would sell the idea of more renewables on the grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#Z00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I shall start by responding to the first question about ensuring network charges and tarriffs appear on bills.<\/p> <p>  The CRU approves network charges because the ESB is a regulator monopoly notwithstanding the point made about contestable connections for renewable generators.  That goes through a process where our revenue is set every year.  As we collect revenue from the suppliers we do not control what goes on the bills that suppliers issue to customers.  We have a certain charge and I ask Mr. Duginan to comment on the exact quantity, say, for the distribution network that is charged and passed on to customers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made an important point about building infrastructure and the long-term nature of these investments.  Ultimately a company like ours, and the regulatory model for a company like ours, involves investing over decades and then recovering that money through customers' bills.  For example, the distribution network is over 45 years but the transmission network is over 50 years.  The way to minimise the impact on customer bills in the here and now is to recover that money slowly over time in order to recover those investments.<\/p><p>In the previous session, reference was made to the scale of the network charges.  I ask Mr. Duignan to comment on that and on the wider role we have in the network or the system to do with encouraging decarbonisation.  Perhaps we will come back to that.

As Mr. Tarrant has said, all the charges are approved by the regulator and then we charge them on to suppliers.  How the supplier passes that on is up to them so they can have different bundles and packages and so on.  That is different for them.  With our charges, if we go back one and half years ago before the current situation with the price of electricity, typically the distribution element of the tariff for a customer would be in and around 22% or 23%, or in that ballpark.  It has not moved since in terms of the euro amount.  What has moved is the wholesale price of electricity.  The overall bill has gone up but the distribution element has not.  I would say that this 22% or 23% element has dropped significantly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the fixed and variable elements.  Again, from a distribution to perspective, our tariff is about one third fixed and two thirds variable.  In other words, one third is a standing charge, on average, across customers, and the other two thirds are variable.  Our actual costs for providing the infrastructure are more fixed than variable.  They are quite low.  In comparison with other European jurisdictions, the trend is to have higher fixed costs for the network element of the bill.  That trend is going up even higher, but ours have been stable now, at about at about 30% or thereabouts, for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Duignan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>There is an absolutely massive change going on in the industry overall, and that is leaving aside the whole volatility that is having a huge impact on customers at the moment with prices.  The whole journey around electrification and achieving the 80% target out to 2030 is a massive challenge for the entire industry.  If one takes the smart metering programme as an example, in respect of which there has been a great deal of discussion and many questions, ultimately, these are building blocks of infrastructure that will enable customers over time to really get value from their energy providers and will be really crucial.  As well as things like the smart metering programme we also have a climate action plan around creating more flexibility for customers in how they manage their demand.  Ultimately, the long-term role of smart metering will support the electrification of transport with people charging the cars at night time, for example, and will support the Government's target of almost 1 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade.<\/p> <p>  The challenge now is to keep working as part of a wider society and to drive on with the change of achieving the 80% target and then on to net zero.  We are planning to play a key role in that.  We are launching a customer portal, for example, to give access to customers of their data in the smart meters later this year and into the new year.

It is safe to say that this area is quite complex.  For customers, it is quite complex.  We had several sessions and we have an understanding of who has responsibility for which area.  Even if one is to look at the climate action framework, several agencies are involved in a lot of those particular areas.  One of those is smart metering.  I believe it is between the ESB and the CRU.  As already indicated, almost 1,000 have smart meters at this stage.  When I asked for details about how many are actually using the tariff, it is actually very low.  Three seems to be an awful long way to go - I believe that 40,000 people are on the best tariff based in the context of their smart meters.  What is being communicated to me is that people are opting to go without the smart meter, and to go another route because they have identified that it is cheaper and particularly for electric vehicle owners, which would be one aspect.  What more can the witnesses do to play their part?  It is pointless having everybody signed up to a smart meter if they are not deriving the benefit from it.<\/p> <p>  The second point relates to renewables.  The ESB has a key responsibility there.  Do the witnesses feel that they are ready for the scale of the challenge, particularly when it comes to offshore wind?  The target is now 7 GW by 2030.  There is a massive amount of work the ESB needs to do in order to be able to facilitate companies investing here.  Where is the ESB at in that regard, and is it ready for the challenge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#AA00400","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Smart meters are a fundamental foundation for the climate change that is coming.  We are hoping to hit the target of installing 1 million smart meters this month.  By the end of 2024, the vast majority of customers will be on smart meters.  We are at the early stages of people adopting smart tariffs.  Ultimately, by providing data we expect to see more competitive offerings coming in from suppliers, providing different options to suit people's lifestyles.  We expect it to develop and grow.  This is part of a European and even a global change relating to having data available to customers who can use that to best effect.  I know it is easy to say that at the moment because customers are really suffering out there.  However, over the years ahead it will fundamentally change how customers use electricity and engage with their suppliers and the whole climate transition.  It will be a very important programme.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our promotion of it, we are doing a lot to highlight the benefits of smart meters for customers.  At the end of the day, we are effectively a neutral party in the system in installing this infrastructure and maintaining it.  There is the benefit of not having estimated bills for customers which has been a major issue for people.  Over time, we will see development in the market regarding charging EVs at night-time, weekends or whenever it might be.  We are committed to playing our part and promoting the increased use of smart meters over the long term, which is fundamental for the electrification of heat and transport.<\/p> <p>  It is worth summarising briefly the different roles relating to offshore energy generation.  The Government made a decision that the transmission asset owner of the offshore assets is EirGrid.  ESB Networks' role is as the onshore transmission asset owner.  The fundamental issue for us when it comes to offshore energy generation is the scale of the reinforcement work that is needed on the transmission system to enable the achievement of the climate action plan targets.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done on the transmission network in the east coast area where the majority of the first phase of projects will be coming in in the coming years, particularly in the Dublin area.  That is in addition to us developing and investing in the distribution network at the same time.  There is an enormous scale of work.<\/p> <p>  We are working closely with EirGrid on the early stages of the development of the projects for which it is responsible.  ESB Networks has responsibility for the detailed design and procurement, managing the contractors and managing the projects through the delivery phase.  There are many different strands relating to building up key resources, and going out and procuring contracts in the marketplace.  With so much to be delivered across climate action in general, access to resources will be key in growing the amount of delivery that is possible.  That will be the challenge and ESB Networks is up for that challenge.  We know what is ahead of us and we are committed to doing everything we can to play our role in the growth of offshore wind energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#BB00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Tarrant"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.

The cap is 50 kW but it seems there are many businesses, in particular, that would certainly have roof space for solar and a demand for more power.  The scheme, therefore, might not be ideal for them.  Why is the cap 50 kW?<\/p><p>If you want to install more than 50 kW, the bureaucracy is different and there are different safety requirements, all of which add costs which may be prohibitive for people thinking about putting reasonably large systems on their premises.  Is thought being given to increasing the cap beyond 50 kW?  <\/p><p> I believe it was said that there had been an increase from 150 to 650 applications.  I suspect that, given the current climate of high energy costs, this will increase exponentially.  Are there plans to connect many more than that because it is still a very small percentage of prospective premises?  We are talking about a cap of probably 20 MW or 30 MW but we could possibly get new capacity to the order of a few hundred megawatts through a scheme of this size.<\/p><p> There is also the related question of the resources ESB Networks put into processing these applications.  It is one thing to say that so many new connections will be made but, if ESB Networks does not have the resources, it will take a long time.  Given the current surge in interest - I find myself using electrical language such as \"surge\" and \"current\" all of the time - are more resources needed to process applications to the mini-generation scheme to get more people onto the network with their new solar installations?

We built on that in the small-scale generation scheme, which we launched last Friday and which allows for generation of up to 200 kW.  It is the next level up.  People can still apply for greater capacities under what is called the enduring connection policy.  There is still that route but we looked at how to streamline the process to make it as simple and fast as possible.  It still has to be technically acceptable but we sought to minimise impact and allow it to be done as quickly as possible.  The mini-generation scheme I was talking about was a great success.  It was oversubscribed and full within three or four months.  We doubled it and added more capacity.  We are seeing that.  We still have headroom.  It is still being called a pilot scheme but we are working with the regulator to treat it as business as usual and to increase the scheme.  We do not intend to stop it but to keep going forward with it although it was launched as a pilot.  The small-scale generation scheme for generation of up to 200 kW was just launched on Friday and we have already had feedback from stakeholders we did not engage with.

With regard to the mini-generation pilot scheme we launched, there was a lot of upfront engagement with the industry as to the standard of the application form and going back and forth in getting to know it.

We have changed our structures and streamlined our process as well.  We are looking at a very fast process with regard to carrying out the study and letting the customer know.  We have also built in mechanisms for the customers' benefit.  For example, they can choose to tick a box and do a maximum export capacity, MEC, reduction.

In terms of the standard charge, approximately one-third of customers' tariffs are paid through the fixed element, which is called the\u00a0distribution use of system charges, DUoS, and the other two-thirds are fixed.  Consumption will change if someone has microgeneration or with the electrification of heat and transport.  Right now, we are about one-third fixed versus two-thirds variable, which is low by international standards as there is more of a move to fixed in other jurisdiction because the network tariff element of the infrastructure that we provide is a fixed cost predominantly but it is one-third.  Right now, the regulator is running a consultation in the form of a tariff structure review.  The regulator ran a consultation towards the end of last year and is considering that.  There will be more phases to that consultation and then that will decide the optimum solution in terms of the tariff structure so fixed versus variable, etc.  The regulator sets the standing charge.

We have pushed infrastructure and responded to demand.  Notwithstanding the current plans, and most of the phase 1 offshore projects are on the east coast, there is a greater opportunity in the long run for renewables on the west coast.  Therefore, we must start planning to reinforce our infrastructure on the west coast side of the country and not view that as a prospect in the distant future.  I believe that development will come on pretty quickly and developers will look to the west, particularly with the advent of floating offshore wind technology.

Significant infrastructure was put into onshore wind projects to develop the assets that were growing in the west.

The future development of the offshore industry could be on all parts of our offshore area and definitely with the growth of floating as a technology for the future.  Ultimately, the first phase will depend on a continuation of the RESS auctions and then beyond that as the offshore wind industry takes off in this country.

After the publication of the final report of the commission of investigation in January of last year, many survivors were disappointed and angered by the treatment of testimony they provided to the confidential committee.  Having gone to the effort of engaging with the confidential committee and reliving what happened to them in institutions, many felt they could not see their own words in the final report.  For many, the commission&rsquo;s report, grounded as it was in the legal approach of a statutory inquiry, felt removed from the profound grief, loss and trauma of their lived experiences.  From my engagement with survivors, I know the hurt that has caused.<\/p> <p>  As we know, the confidential committee module was created alongside the inquisitorial process to allow those with lived experience of the institutions to provide their accounts as informally as possible.  Although this was envisaged as a way to allow the truth as survivors wanted it told to emerge, I recognise that this has not happened for many.  In June of 2021, following comments attributed to one member of the commission, I indicated the possibility of a review of the testimony offered to the confidential committee.  I have always recognised the importance of these testimonies.  That is why I went to some lengths to secure the audio recordings of these testimonies when originally they were believed to have been deleted.  I believe that a process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me.  Such a process can restore choice and agency to survivors.  The accounts will be housed in the national centre for research and remembrance.  This rightly places the lived experience of survivors at the heart of our national archives in a visible and powerful way.<\/p> <p>  A number of factors have influenced the proposed approach.  First, the core concern expressed to me by survivors is that their lived experiences have not been adequately reflected thus far.  They do not see their words in the commission&rsquo;s report and they feel their voices were ignored.  Second, we must recognise the continuing influence of the legal framework provided by the Oireachtas to facilitate and direct the independent commission&rsquo;s work.  Significant legal complexities would arise in seeking to facilitate an external review of accounts provided privately and in confidence within the robust legal framework of a commission of investigation.  The Government cannot, via a non-statutory process, retrospectively alter or interrogate the independent commission&rsquo;s findings or methodology.  We must be upfront about such complexities.  However, this does not prevent human rights experts or others from conducting further analysis of these matters.  Notably, part 5 of the final report details the sources used by the commission for the express purpose of supporting such work.  Finally, I believe that such a review could not fully respond to the concerns of those who were unhappy with the record of their testimony created by the commission.  It would not change the commission&rsquo;s report and it would completely exclude those who had not had the opportunity to engage with the commission.<\/p> <p>  The new initiative will focus on respectful recording and acknowledgement of the lived experiences of those who spent time in institutions.  The process will be underpinned by statute and operate on a voluntary basis with the consent of participants.  Those who recounted their experiences to the confidential committee will have the option of permitting the reuse of this testimony and-or offering new or additional oral or written testimony.  If someone does not want to give their testimony again, they can use the existing testimony that has been recorded by the commission, which was recorded orally by the commission&rsquo;s archives.  No one will be asked to recount their experiences again if that is something they do not wish to do.  This process will be overseen by a team with expertise in human rights, trauma and memory, communications and oral history.<\/p> <p>  In advancing our deliberations, we are consulting with relevant legal and technical experts to develop the initiative in the context of work on the national centre for research and remembrance.<\/p><p>Most importantly, we will also consult survivors on their views.  The initiative demonstrates the State&rsquo;s willingness to hear about and to formally acknowledge the deeply personal accounts of survivors and I will bring specific proposals to Government for its approval.<br\/><br\/>In my time as Minister, I have endeavoured to improve the manner in which we communicate the actions we are taking to respond to legacy issues, to survivors and former residents.  As such, I regret the indirect and limited manner in which survivors heard about deliberations on this issue, via a response to a media query.  My preference, and my clear intention, was to update survivors using existing channels, which we do on a regular basis, to ensure that survivors are the first to hear of developments.  To that end, details of this initiative were included in our most recent quarterly update on the action plan, which recently issued to our mailing list.<br\/><br\/>I have always been clear that the report of the commission is not the end point in our engagement with the legacy of mother and baby institutions.  Last November, I published the Government&rsquo;s action plan, designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families.  Intensive work is under way to deliver on this.<br\/><br\/>Members of this committee are aware of the significant legislative developments which have taken place this year.  The Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 was enacted in June.  The information provisions came into operation yesterday.  To update the committee, already 1,898 queries have been received by the website <i>birthinfo.ie<\/i>, with people inquiring and looking for access to their information.  Similarly, in July, the Institutional Burials Act 2022 was signed into law.  This morning, the Cabinet agreed that the final order establishing the Tuam agency would be agreed.  It has been determined that no environmental impact statement, EIS, is needed in respect of the Tuam site, and that eliminates any potential delay on that ground.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has given approval to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to appoint a director and that process may begin shortly.<br\/><br\/>All elements of this work are hugely important, and they are a priority for me and for the Government.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention, and I look forward to answering their questions. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#A00500","speaker":"1477","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

The fact is that people went in and gave their testimonies to the confidential session within the commission.  The Minister cannot change the content of that report nor would we want him to have the ability to do that, naturally.  However, there is a necessity for a mechanism, because there were individuals who felt they had been reflected in the report, but that it was incorrect and that there were errors in their testimony.  There were also those who felt they misunderstood the process or that it was not clearly outlined to them exactly how the confidential evidence would be treated.  It would appear, with due respect to everybody involved, that the treatment was very legalistic in how it was dealt with, rather than engaging with just how sensitive this was.  People went in and relived the trauma of their youth and their time in these institutions over a considerable period, and they shared that.  <\/p> <p>  For many, an archive is not sufficient.

This is going to be part of the wider Government response in the centre for research and remembrance, which we hope to base in Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  It will be designed by experts who have the most knowledgeable approach to oral history and to the communication of sensitive issues such as these, as well as about how the actual words of survivors can be conveyed to the public and how they can stand as part of the historical record and as part of the history of what happened in these institutions.<\/p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney rightly says that one of the issues that impacted on survivors was the legalistic approach to the testimony that they gave.

I am trying to provide a forum where the literal words of survivors form part of our record.  As the Senator says, 550 people went before the confidential committee and for some of them it was a very traumatic experience.  They set out what happened to them in these institutions.  The only evidence of that on the record are these condensed paragraphs that are in the report.  Sometimes, it is one person&rsquo;s story that has been condensed and sometimes a number of stories have been condensed into one.  I know from survivors who have written to me and who have spoken to me that that is a source of anger and that their own experience is not being expressed here.<\/p> <p>  We have an opportunity here to get their written transcript or the taped transcript of their testimony through a subject access request.  Then we can allow that to form part of the lived experience initiative; we can do that and allow them to add extra material, or we can let them re-record their own lived experience.  It is also important that this is open to others as well.  Again, we do not want to just narrow this down to the individuals who gave testimony.  There are other people who have come forward following the huge publicity the issue of mother and baby institutions has received over the past two years and who now wish their history to be recorded as part of this as well.  That is why we are taking this approach to not go a legalistic route, as was adopted in the end regarding the testimony given before the confidential committee.  Instead, we are going for this broader route that is informed by oral communications and that is trauma-informed to allow for their words to stand as part of the history.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#B00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":337,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister for that.

On the initial point, the Senator has described what I would like to see in terms of the final outcome.  Obviously, as I have made clear, it will be people who have much greater expertise and knowledge in these areas, both in the collection of this material and its subsequent portrayal in the records of a memorial centre, who will make the determinations about how that is best done.<\/p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, were the Government to take a position to undertake that more legalistic approach that would be seen as a reviewing and a contradicting or rewriting of certain elements, and the confidential committee is just one element of the workings of the commission of investigation, that does become problematic.  It becomes legally difficult in the context of the commission of investigation legislation, which very clearly establishes an independent commission of investigation.  For one part of its workings to be reanalysed or re-critiqued does pose a difficulty.<\/p> <p>  Following the appearance in Oxford, I am aware that the chair of the commission wrote to this committee and outlined the approach it took to the testimony.  I know the survivors subsequently may have taken issue with the chair's description of how that testimony was treated.  I recognise that.  This is why in the proposal we are looking to bring forward, we are looking to move away from that purely legalistic approach, which has caused very significant upset, and particularly in the terms.  We all recall the phrasing and the design of the executive summary of the commission's report, which again is highly legalistic and was insulting to survivors and may also have obscured some of the more important legal findings that the body of the commission's work actually did reach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#C00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":340,"content":"<p>We are all here today because of the continued refusal of the Minister, this Government and the State to respect basic principles of justice and laws, as the will and preference of survivors in relation to the mother and baby institutions.  At all stages, survivors have been met with paternalism, disregard, disrespect and attempts to undermine their position.<\/p><p>In June 2021 the Minister announced a plan for an independent expert to examine, through a human rights lens, the testimonies given to the commission.  Why?  It is because the Minister knows, I know, and we all know that the findings of the commission's report were incorrect.  The Minister's decision to do this only came after months of sustained criticism from survivors, human rights experts and researchers, concerning the commission's methodology, treatment of witnesses, inconsistencies, and overall poor quality of the final report and its findings, down to the most basic things such as no evidence of illegal adoptions, things we all know happened.<\/p><p>There was an overwhelming consensus that the review was necessary to correct the major issues with the final report as the definitive document on the long history of the State and church abuse of children, girls and women in these horrific institutions.  The review remains essential to respect the wishes of survivors, to meet our international human rights obligations, and to inform redress.  It was also around the time of the refusal of the commission members to provide any form of accountability at this committee and the Government's inability to act.  The Government would not extend the commission and would not do anything even though we warned the Minister that this would fall back on the Government as a result, and here we are.<\/p><p>Despite the fact that in June 2021 the Minister had proposals ready for Cabinet, 14 months later in August this year survivors discovered, via Elaine Loughlin in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, that the Minister had abandoned the plan.  In the words of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance, the Minister has denied members and those who provided testimony to the confidential committee the opportunity to have those testimonies reviewed by an independent expert with a human rights background, as previously promised.<\/p><p>The Minister's opening statement says it all.  The Minister has said: &quot;I believe that a process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me.&quot;  The Minister has satisfied himself but nobody else in the process: not survivors, not campaigners, and not human rights experts.  Unilaterally, the Minister has decided what is best, has betrayed another commitment, and now is trying to tell the people directly affected that this is the best thing.  The Minister knows that he knows better than them.  I wonder if the Minister understands the arrogance and paternalism of his words today to those people.<\/p><p>In June 2021 the Minister had a proposal ready for consideration at Cabinet.  More than one year later the Minister decided that &quot;Significant legal complexities would arise in seeking to facilitate an external review of accounts provided privately and in confidence within the robust legal framework of a commission of investigation.&quot;  Why were these legal complexities not discovered before the Minister announced the independent review ?  From his own accounts the Minister had an ill-prepared proposal that gave false hope to a highly vulnerable group of people<\/p><p>On the Minister's third point he said: &quot;I believe that such a review could not fully respond to the concerns of those who were unhappy with the record of their testimony created by the commission.&quot;  There are two issues here.  In June 2021 a review was an appropriate mechanism to respond to survivors' concerns.  Then in August 2022 it was not.  The Minister is contradicting himself.  Then there is the issue of deciding how to address survivors' concerns and not asking them.  Again, without input from those affected, the Minister is deciding for them.  This is more paternalism.  Does the Minister not see those contradictions and the paternalistic attitude?  I actually do not understand how there is not any kind of shame about these kinds of inconsistencies and the misleading of people.<\/p><p>Another excuse that the Minister mentions is &quot;The Government cannot, via a non-statutory process, retrospectively alter or interrogate the independent commission&rsquo;s findings or methodology.&quot;  The Minister can interrogate the report via a statutory process so why is he not looking into that?  Is the Department looking into that?<\/p><p>Reading over all of the documents, the Minister's statements, and the initial announcement in June 2021, I can only come to one of two conclusions.  Either the plan for an independent review was poorly prepared, did not stand up to any form of scrutiny and had to be abandoned, or the plan was opposed by the Minister's Department or another State actor and the Minister was shut down.  Both are plausible from the evidence available to us: the disgraceful treatment of survivors with this &quot;make it up as you go along&quot; approach, or the prevalent ingrained structural forces in Government Departments and State bodies not to provide survivors with justice.  Which is it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#C00300","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":341,"content":"<p>I will address a specific point.  There was no proposal coming to Cabinet in June 2021.  I am not sure, but I am aware there was some newspaper coverage of that.  There was, however, no specific proposal.  Indeed, in July 2021 when we debated the issue in the Houses I spoke about trying to ensure that the testimonies of persons who appeared before the confidential committee were on the public record.  I said explicitly then that I did not know how this was going to be done because we had nothing prepared at that stage.  From my point of view there was not a proposal in June 2021.<\/p> <p>  On the wider issue, and Deputy Cairns's statement about me ignoring the will and preference of the survivors and acting unilaterally, over the course of my time in this Department I have met a significant number of survivors, through groups and individuals, either online or in the Department here.  A significant number of survivors have also come up to me on the street and at events to identify themselves to me.  They told me that they had been in such and such an institution and had been subject to an illegal birth registration.  They discussed their views on where they see the actions of the Department and my actions as the Minister over the past two years.<\/p><p>Some were undoubtedly critical.  Others recognised the steps that have been taken.  At the time that the issue came up and the time following the appearance of Professor Daly at the seminar in Oxford, the key issue for survivors who wrote to me was that their words were not being reflected in the historical record.  That is not something I thought; it is what survivors were saying to me in their communications.  They did not feel their experiences were being reflected.  They had gone to the trouble, and through the trauma and upset, of going before the confidential committee and all their input had been boiled down to a short paragraph that, in certain cases, was not just their own story.  It is on that basis I am bringing forward this proposal.<\/p><p> The steps involved with this proposal are that we will first seek Government approval before a consultation, after which we will come back and provide a legislative basis.  There will be an opportunity for survivors to give their views on what we are trying to achieve.  A memorial centre in the national records is one element of our response.

I heard him talking about the issue on the radio so he certainly brought the proposal to the national airwaves.  I spoke on the radio after the Minister and asked what he will do if we have two reports, one of which states there is no evidence of illegal adoption or incarceration, all of the things we know happened, and another report from an independent person who examined the report through a human rights lens, which would likely find there is evidence that all those illegalities and crimes occurred in those institutions.  Everybody knows those things happened anyway.  I believe the Minister went on the radio that day in good faith because he thought there should be an independent review because, like all of us, he recognises that need.  The Minister said that key to changing his mind was his engagement with survivors who told him their main issue is that their experiences are not recognised enough, which can be addressed through the national archives, or another means.  This is the committee for the Department and the members of this committee can tell the Minister that is not the only concern people have.  They also want justice.  The findings of those reports being so fundamentally flawed has a profound impact outside of experiences not being documented.  That is important but there are also issues in respect of redress.  It is not fair to just pick one issue that was important to people and scrap the plan to provide them with justice and acknowledge that what they went through was horrific.  That is what is missing.  The Minister is unilaterally deciding what is best because of some engagements he had.  What about what the committee has to say about the issue?  We have spent a lot of time engaging with people about this particular issue.  It is not fair.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to trivialise the situation by explaining this but if the situations that occurred in mother and baby homes now happened in a home or another State-run institution, the normal processes of justice and laws would pertain.  There would be accountability, justice and all of those things that have always been denied to people who were in those institutions.  This whole process, which has gone on for the past two years, has been a longwinded way of doing that again.  People, including the Minister, wanted an independent review.  He knows it was for reasons other than just recognising the experiences of survivors.  Of course, that is an important part of justice.  Will the Minister at least acknowledge that he understood it was about more than that?  Perhaps his mind has changed because other State actors have shut down his proposals.  We need to know what is happening because this is just another chapter in a very long tale of denying people basic and fundamental principles of justice in this democratic country.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#D00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":344,"content":"<p>We have sought to address the specific issues that survivors have raised with me and the committee.

In the process that flowed from my PhD, the subsequent Government inquiry, led by Dr. Eileen Doyle, and the revelations of September 2021 from \"Women of Honour\", it seems to be a recurring pattern that the concerns of those who are targeted by others, or who find themselves in a vulnerable position in institutions such as our Defence Forces or in mother and baby homes, seem to be subordinated to either the moral and legal concerns of adversarial approaches, or other procedural or administrative purposes.<\/p><p>We have to remember that people who make these disclosures relive the experiences. They are retraumatised.  It is extremely important that their very powerful and compelling testimony can been seen explicitly to facilitate acknowledgement and healing, as opposed to further traumatising and adding further injury. <\/p><p> I am coming late to this issue, given the circumstances of my arrival in the Seanad but it occurs to me that we already have very powerful instruments and methods for getting to the heart of these very sensitive issues.  We have experts of international renown in all of our universities.  We have some amazing women and some men who are very well placed to carry out incisive and qualitative phenomenological research into the testimonies and experiences of these survivors.  A huge body of international literature already exists on how best to go about doing this.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, knows this from our shared background as academics.  I am always really puzzled as to why such inquiries are led by senior council or judges when we have an embarrassment of riches in the country.  We can put together these very compelling disclosures from survivors, weave them through with all of the secondary sources available to, and with the resources of, the State, to arrive at extremely compelling findings that can contribute significantly to knowledge and assist us to move forward.  When findings are constrained and confined within this quasi-legal frame, it really limits through very positivistic and deterministic thought processes.  It narrows and undermines.  I hope that the survivors' personal accounts housed in the national centre for research and remembrance would be amenable to this type of research.  I agree with everything said by Deputy Cairns and it chimes with my own experience in this regard.  We find, 20 years after the original research, that women in our armed forces are still targeted in this way.  There is a judge-led inquiry under way at the moment to investigate that.  Can we not learn from this?  I ask the Minister whether it is possible for him to suggest to Cabinet that in the future, rather than appointing senior counsel, judges and so on, we look at the resources we already actually have to assist in truth and reconciliation.  There is a lot more to follow.  There are other areas of Irish life that require this type of inquiry. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#D00800","speaker":"1699","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":351,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I might give my reflection on what he has said because it is really valuable.  In the 18 months following the publication of the commission of investigation report, we can see the huge problems with dealing with issues as sensitive as those the commission had to address in the context of the commission of investigation legislation.  Deputy Cairns spoke about the importance of justice.  Finding justice, without going that quasi-legal route, is extremely difficult because as soon as we talk of issues of justice, we talk of issues of accountability, responsibility and culpability.  We then bring in a requirement for people to be able to defend their legal name and their actions, as well as the need for cross-examination and fair procedures and that is a consequence of the common law legal system we exist in.  That system does not work well with a process seeking to understand the lived experiences of individuals.  While I was not in the Oireachtas when the specific terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the mother and baby institutions were drafted, I think the confidential committee, as a sub-committee of the actual commission itself, was created as an effort to try to bridge that.  It was to be a separate source where people could give, perhaps not sworn testimony in the same way that testimony before the commission was sworn, but another place where testimony could be given.  We know now, in terms of the overall outcome, how unsatisfactory, to put it mildly, that was for those 550 survivors who gave testimony before it.  To come back to the Senator's first point, the approach being adopted under the lived experience initiative, which will be adopted with the records and memorial centre, will be one that is trauma-informed and one based and undertaken by people who have an understanding of oral history, human rights and how people coming to give their personal stories need and should be treated. That is why we wanted to provide the flexibility.  Should an individual who has already relived his or her story before the confidential committee not wish to do that again, that person could use the recording testimony that is already preserved in the archive and need only give permission for it to flow into the lived experience initiative.  That is all such people would need to do, as well as giving the option to add to that or start afresh and allowing new people beyond this 550 to be able to do the same thing as well, albeit all in a trauma-informed manner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#E00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":352,"content":"<p>I will respond briefly.  Within our libraries and academic research, we have tens of thousands of research projects that look in great detail at extremely sensitive issues such as this.  They do not require legal examination.  In the processes, oversight and the governance which the Minister and I are so familiar with in the university sector, from time to time, research on the public record, in a permanently digitably-searchable archive and open to everybody, can occasionally be referred for legal advice.  It happened with my own research back in 1998.  It was referred to Arthur Cox and certain observations were made but all of that sensitive information was still published and is on the public record.  It has led to a greater understanding.  I am concerned that we do not put the cart before the horse.  The legal filter, if you like, is not the one that should be applied first.  We should take tried and tested, centuries-old, methodological approaches to these very sensitive issues and let in the light.  Let the findings speak for themselves.

However, if we keep doing it the way we have been doing it thus far, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.  We are going to let down survivors and that it is going to have a chilling effect on the willingness of people to come forward to help us to understand our Republic and how we got to where we are and the measures we need to take to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  When it comes to children with disabilities, children with additional needs, we are making the same mistakes over and over again.  Therefore we need to learn.

He spoke in his opening statement about some survivors not being able to see their own words in the final report.  I can only say that I have been on this committee since it was originally formed and I know from working with the Minister that he has been listening to survivors.  He has met survivors in my own area of Carlow-Kilkenny and has come down to visit them.  He has been listening to their concerns.  There is a slight issue with communication, particularly in this instance, although I welcome the information given by the Minister on the radio recently that more than 1,898 survivors have looked for their birth information.  That is very welcome.  As part of our remit in this committee, we have to find solutions.  We have met so many survivors and as previous speakers have said, this issue is so sensitive for the survivors and their families.  The Minister and I, and the committee, are finding solutions and the only way we can do that is to work together.  I see the Minister spoke in his opening statement about Government approval been sought in the coming weeks for publication of the mother and baby homes institutional payment scheme.  One thing I have said and will always say is that survivors are not getting any younger.  We have a duty of care regarding payment as soon as possible.  Local authorities need to play a bigger part in this going forward.  I am working at the moment on a very sensitive case around housing need, medical cards and things like that.  We are not giving this issue the urgency it needs.  This needs to be communicated better and, if nothing else, we need to deliver on all the different things we have agreed to.  The one thing we need to do now is make sure that there are payments, housing, grants and enhanced medical cards.  I understand that much of this has been worked on but there are many things that have not.  If we do nothing else as a committee, for ourselves and for survivors, we have to deliver on that.<\/p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the national centre for research and remembrance.  That is so important but we need more joined-up thinking across all the different agencies.  This needs to be a priority.  The timescale is of utmost importance.

As committee members, we are fully committed to making sure the outcome is the best we can get for a situation that is so sensitive and has affected so many lives and people in our community.  As someone who has worked with the Minister and with the survivors, I can say he has always written to them, met them and come back to them.  I am very respectful of that, as are the survivors who I have asked him to talk to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#F00300","speaker":"1511"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":356,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy and recognise what she is saying in terms of communication, particularly the communication of this issue.  I recognised in my opening statement that this issue was not communicated properly.  That is something we should have resolved.  We have our quarterly bulletin but we should have provided an update on this specific issue.  Survivors should not have been reading about this in response to a media query.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy makes the very fair point about the age of many of the survivors.  On the issue of the payments legislation specifically, the final touches are being put to the full draft of that legislation.  I need to bring it to Cabinet and then we will look to bring it rapidly into the D&aacute;il for Second Stage.  If it is of any reassurance, we are not just working on the legislation but are working on the basis that it will be passed and are putting in place the mechanisms that will actually allow for the processing of these payments.  There will have to be a significant infrastructure behind this.  We are talking about up to 34,000 individual payments and 16,000 enhanced medical card applications.  There is a lot of work that has to go into delivering that and in a timely manner.  That is happening at the same time as the legislation.  As I say, I hope to have the legislation to Cabinet this month and then it will be brought swiftly into the Oireachtas after that.  I am not meaning to sound defensive in any way, as this legislation needs to happen, but just to recognise that the unit in the Department has delivered the Birth Information and Tracing Act, and a lot of work around this; not just the legislation itself but its implementation.  It has delivered the Institutional Burials Act and, even today, there is a piece of work going through Cabinet in terms of delivery of the agency. The Department has been working on this lived experience initiative, on the records and memorials centre, and on other elements of the scheme such as the funds orf memorialisation being undertaken by groups.  I think eight of the 22 items of the action plan have been completed and another 12 are under way.  An intensive body of work is being undertaken.  I take the Deputy's point that redress is of huge importance to survivors and needs to be acted on swiftly.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#F00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":357,"content":"<p>Do you have anything else to add Deputy Murnane O'Connor?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#F00500","speaker":"1449"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":358,"content":"<p>I know from working in my own area of Carlow-Kilkenny with the Chair, that timing is crucial.

The Minister even acknowledged how people found out that the commitment that was given was not going to happen.  It is really important that we have the memorialisation and archives and people get to tell their story but when people go to a commission, while it is not a criminal investigation, they nearly see it in the same light.  They see as if they were giving a statement in that they feel that there is potentially a pathway to justice.  That is possibly what is missing for people.  <\/p><p> I hear what the Minister is saying about the legal complexities but in respect of the High Court case in January 2021, were changes not made at that point?  If there were, was it possible for the State to look at making other changes to the commission of investigation?  If there is an issue around legal difficulties, was there any way through amending legislation that this could have been changed?  <\/p><p> My next question concerns the information and tracing legislation.  Could the Minister remind people how they register for that?  I know a significant number of people have already registered for that.  Could he address any changes arising out of the High Court?  If there were changes, was a precedent set then so that we could have made other changes?  Was there a way of changing legislation?  The memorialisation is really important but everybody has heard that people felt that there was nearly an attitude or a certain tone throughout the report along the lines of \"well those were the times we were living in and it was unfortunate.\".  I know some of the findings were very robust and they were welcome but that is what people felt.  They felt it was nearly half an apology along the lines of \"we're sorry this happened but sure those were the kind of the times we lived in and it's a pity.  Let's all move on now.\".  That is why when people thought someone with a human rights background was going to look at it, they really welcomed it because it felt like this was going to get the scrutiny it deserved.  To a certain extent, it is probably the commission members who have us in this situation and they were the ones who would not come before this committee, which is unfortunate.  We are relying on the Minister to pick up the slack for want of a better word.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#F00700","speaker":"1449","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":361,"content":"<p>In response to the Chairman's third question, for clarity, is she talking about amending the commission of investigation legislation in a forward-looking way so that it can-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#G00200","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":362,"content":"<p>Yes.

Another commission of investigation - the Farrelly commission -  is ongoing.<\/p><p>Regarding the point about the High Court case, a case was taken by a number of survivors and former residents seeking that certain paragraphs in the commission's report be struck down.  An agreement was reached between the State and those survivors and that agreement, which was ratified by the court, was that a statement be appended to the commission's report, be present wherever the commission's report is officially displayed and outline the fact that survivors should have been consulted in terms of the process and should have received the final draft of the report to allow them to comment and that subsequently they do not agree with certain findings.  It lists various paragraphs of the commission's report.  That is a really important step because we all know that from the day the commission's report came out, there was very significant anger about some of the conclusions.  It is really important that this anger and dissatisfaction is now reflected in the official record.  That is an official statement that lies beside the commission's report.  <\/p><p>In terms of the information and tracing legislation, the key route there is an online route but it can also be accessed via phone and through a letter as well.  The website address is <i>www.birthinfo.ie<\/i>.  The website is quite easy to use.  You pick which category you belong to, for example, are you a mother, an adopted person, somebody who was subject to boarding out or illegal birth registration or somebody with questions about your origins.  You then draw down that menu and tick whether you want to register in the contact preference register and whether you want to receive information.  It is an easy-to-use site.  I know there was one issue yesterday about people registering from the US.  There was an issue with US phone numbers.  My understanding is that this has been resolved.  There was very significant drawdown on the first day with almost 2,000 people seeking information.  It is good to see it being taken up and used.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CYJ2022100400002#G00400","speaker":"1477"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":364,"content":"<p>Regarding the official statement, would it not have been possible to do something similar if there had been a review with a human rights perspective?

I fully understand what the Minister means about that.  It is, however, important for us to acknowledge here today that there are consequences for not repudiating a report that has incorrect findings and which did not even produce any kind of methodology into how it came about those findings.  This needs to be acknowledged.  It is actually very sickening to hear the Minister say in response to Senator Clonan that he would take that approach on memorialisation, about which the Senator spoke so eloquently.  That approach has not been taken in relation to any of the other legislation that we have been dealing with.  Why is it just with memorialisation?  Is it because there is no cost to the State then?  The consequences of a report with incorrect findings like that has an impact on issues such as redress.  The Minister spoke about the redress scheme as if it is fantastic, but of course if the report found that there were these obscene human rights violations in them, redress would be more appropriate for the crimes that were committed.  Perhaps a person might get &euro;5,000.  That is ridiculous.  That a person must have been in an institution for longer than six months is, again, ridiculous.  Of course there are consequences to having this report.

It is a pleasure to be able to do so and it makes for a much better meeting.  Forgive me that I am hoarse.  I have a little bit of a dose but it is not Covid so I will endure.<\/p> <p>  Some of the witnesses will have given evidence in Oireachtas committees and some perhaps have not.  I remind them to switch their mobile phones to flight mode.

The witnesses might identify themselves as they are called.  I welcome Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie, spokesperson, and Mr. Peter Collins, of I BIKE Dublin; Ms Andrea Keane, CEO and Mr. Gareth Quinn, central operations manager, of Dublin Bus; four representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, namely, Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman, Superintendent Thomas Murphy, Superintendent Se&aacute;n Fallon and Superintendent Se&aacute;n O'Reardon; and Dr. Madeleine Lyes, chair, and Mr. Eoin Buckley, committee member, of the Limerick Pedestrian Network.<\/p> <p>  Most of the witnesses will be familiar with the housekeeping on privilege and would expect this in any event but there is a long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person or entity identifiable, or otherwise engage in any speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.<\/p> <p>  We may have some members participating remotely but we do not have any witnesses participating remotely.

Some of the groups have four witnesses and others have two.  The opening statements are per organisation, not per witness.  You can share that or have one lead speaker at the outset.  You can divide it up whatever way you want.  Once the opening statements have been delivered I will call on members of the committee to put their questions in the order they indicate to me.  One or two members have already indicated to me the order in which they wish to come in and we have a rota system so we will go around the committee and members have a seven-minute slot, which is used to direct questions and for responses from witnesses.  A member can choose to push hard with questions for seven minutes or to start with a wide question and allow witnesses to talk back.  Each member has a mandate and each one is entitled to use the time as he or she sees fit.  The only thing I will do is if the conversation goes out of bounds or if the time is up I will move it on to the next speaker.  If we have time there is a second round of four minutes each and there is potentially even a third round but we usually cover it within that formula.  If any members are particularly interested in getting in ahead of others they can indicate, which one member has already done.

Our written submission focuses primarily on the enforcement of illegal parking in cycle lanes but it also considers other illegal driver behaviour that endangers the safety of people who walk, wheel and cycle.<\/p> <p>  Parking in cycle lanes is not a victimless crime.  In June of this year, a three year-old girl, travelling in a child seat on her mother&rsquo;s bike, was killed in Chicago when her mother tried to overtake a vehicle parked in the cycle lane and was hit by a passing truck.  A similar incident in Strasbourg some years ago resulted in the death of a 25 year-old woman.  The driver of the parked vehicle was later convicted of manslaughter in recognition of the part his illegal parking had caused in the woman&rsquo;s death.  In Ireland, there have been at least two fatalities in the past six years where a person cycling has collided with a dangerously parked vehicle and there has been at least one other instance where illegally parked cars were found to be a contributory factor in the death of a person cycling.  It is our view that this illegal and dangerous behaviour is not treated with the seriousness it deserves.<\/p> <p>  It is not just the danger to people who currently cycle that is at issue; illegal parking on cycle lanes creates a safety concern, which deters people from cycling.  We know from the National Transport Authority, NTA&rsquo;s, walking and cycling index 2021 that 22% of Dublin residents do not cycle but would like to.  This figure is even higher for women and for people from ethnic minorities and illustrates the barriers to people taking up cycling.  Section 55 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 describes the offence of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and states &ldquo;A person shall not park in a public place a vehicle\" if, when so parked, the vehicle would be \"likely to cause danger to other persons using the place\".  It is our view that parking on a cycle lane, in a bus lane or on a footpath meets the test for parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and that it should therefore incur a fine and three penalty points.<\/p> <p>  A significant issue with enforcement in Dublin is the fractured nature of its operation.  The four local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, to a degree, the National Transport Authority, all have responsibility for enforcement of driver behaviour and it is often unclear where the lines of responsibility lie.  The result is that many offences fall between the cracks, especially those that may be perceived as being of a less serious nature.  This has led to a culture of impunity where people have little fear of enforcement and the law is routinely ignored.  The Government is investing millions of euro in active travel infrastructure to provide people with safe and sustainable alternatives to the private car.  Without proper enforcement, there will be a very poor return on that investment.  Our written submission presents several examples of evidence of a chronic lack of enforcement of illegal parking in cycle lanes, which I invite the committee members to read.  All of the evidence shows a level of enforcement that is negligible compared with the scale of the problem.  We have also presented evidence on various other offences which are poorly enforced at present and which impact on the perceived safety of cycling as a mode of transport.<\/p> <p>  We have made a series of recommendations, some of which are included in the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy but which have yet to be implemented.  Again, we invite the committee to review those recommendations and are happy to take questions on them here.  We note that fines for road traffic offences are regularly reviewed and that there have been increases in some fines in recent months but these increases will only be effective if enforcement improves.  I BIKE Dublin recommends that the above requests be delivered to ensure the safety of all road users and to create a safer and more attractive urban environment where people of all ages and abilities can choose to walk, wheel or cycle without fear of injury or worse.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":412,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Ferrie for those opening remarks.

I am joined by Mr. Gareth Quinn, central area planning manager.  I have submitted a longer opening statement but in the interest of time, I will read a shorter version.  However I am happy to take questions on any of the other issues.<\/p><p>We welcome the opportunity to set out the company&rsquo;s views on the enforcement of road traffic offences.  Given the nature of our operations, this submission will focus on bus lane enforcement and potential deterrents and solutions to this issue.  Dublin Bus is the largest public transport provider in the State.  Our services reflect the full spectrum of public transport connectivity in the capital, ranging from orbital and radial routes to 24-hour services and Nitelink services.  This gives Dublin Bus a keen insight into the needs of the city, its businesses and the wider community.  My opening statement will focus on the importance of bus lanes in maintaining frequency, reliability and consistency of journey times; the importance of bus lanes to the overall customer experience; and how bus lanes have helped and continue to help make the bus a more attractive option.  It will also highlight technological solutions that could aid enforcement and some examples of cities which have utilised same; practical solutions which could be implemented almost immediately; and how Dublin Bus would like to facilitate the implementation of these items.<\/p><p>Of the many causes of delays to bus services, few seem more inherently unjust than drivers who illegally park or drive in a dedicated bus lane, triggering a slowdown for the dozens of customers stuck behind.  While improved bus lane enforcement is only one piece of the puzzle, it is nevertheless an important one.  Dublin Bus is a solutions provider and it is in this spirit that we put forward these options.  The four options I would like to mention are renewing the focus on bus lane enforcement; simplifying bus lane designation by moving all bus lanes to 24-hour; examining the technological solutions that could potentially assist both the National Transport Authority, NTA, and customers; and increasing fines for driving or parking in bus lanes.<\/p><p> On the importance of bus lane enforcement, buses can help reduce traffic congestion and air pollution as they provide a more efficient way of moving people from one point to another.  However, private vehicles travelling and parking in bus lanes reduces the efficiency of buses and creates unnecessary congestion.  Pre-Covid-19, our network speed at peak times was in the region of 14 km\/h, with substantial variations across all transport corridors.  While some gains have been made due to priority and changes to travel patterns, private transport remains extremely competitive in terms of journey times to the city.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#C00500","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":415,"content":"<p>Ms Keane, I am reluctant to interrupt, but you are out of time.

I am the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing and community engagement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am accompanied today by acting chief superintendent, Mr. Thomas Murphy, superintendents Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Reardon and Se&aacute;n Fallon, who co-ordinate and monitor the operations and activities of the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau.  Under my leadership, the bureau is responsible for policy formulation, communications and media relations, inter-agency co-ordination and traffic enforcement strategies.  Road safety and roads policing remain a strategic priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are included in our policing plan for 2022.  The plan gives effect to our strategy statement to continue to promote and enforce responsible behaviours on our roads, reduce risk to vulnerable users through targeted prevention and intervention activities, work in partnership with the Road Safety Authority and others to strengthen collaboration to achieve our collective vision and deliver road safety objectives through high-visibility operations, education, engineering and co-operation.<\/p> <p>  We are committed to ensuring that our roadways, cycle lanes and footpaths are safe for all users, with particular focus on vulnerable road users, given the risks caused by vehicles parked on footpaths and cycle lanes.  While the enforcement of road traffic legislation is part of the everyday work of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we also work in tandem with local authority partners who share responsibilities in this area.  This allows us, especially our roads policing members, to focus on lifesaver enforcement, education and influencing road user behaviours.  Additionally, we periodically mount specific operations to target illegal parking, which has a detrimental effect on the most vulnerable in society.<\/p> <p>  I will now briefly outline the structures and governance within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the areas of roads policing.  We have four regional assistant commissioners who are responsible for governance and oversight of roads policing performance in their respective regions, utilising the dedicated divisional roads policing units and inspectors in each division.  In addition, a chief superintendent has been assigned a portfolio.  That chief superintendent works with us in the national bureau for targeted co-ordination and tasking of roads policing personnel across their region.  This ensures an agile process that takes into account current national and regional trends.  This is very much evidence-based and data-led and represents what our data is showing us annually.  It supports our vision of fostering a culture of continuous improvement, enhancing innovation and responsiveness to change by ensuring that roads policing activities are information-led.  The plan is aligned to our national communication strategy and also incorporates inter-agency enforcement.<\/p> <p>  I have covered our internal roads policing structures, one of a number of strands that have governance and oversight over roads policing nationally.  Externally, I am a member of the road safety transformation board, which has governance over the governmental road safety strategy.  I also report to the Policing Authority on roads policing matters.  I thank the committee members for their time.

We advocate on behalf of pedestrians in Limerick city and county.  We work to develop awareness of pedestrian needs and solutions, to foster links with other community and active travel groups and to be a source of information around best practice relating to pedestrian infrastructure and amenities.  Through our voluntary activity, we consult with local and national government bodies, host public walking assessment events and are actively involved in our local public participation network.  We are grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee today on issues relating to illegal parking and can confirm the assertion of the committee that there appears to be a disregard in relation to parking on footpaths and in cycle lanes.<\/p> <p>  We are in a strange position in Ireland, where parking on footpaths is illegal under road traffic regulations, but little awareness, understanding or enforcement of this law is evident.  In the context of the climate transition and in particular the enormous investment this Government is making in supporting a transformative modal shift towards active travel, the money being spent to upgrade footpaths and make walking safer and more attractive is in danger of being wasted if we continue to allow widespread pavement parking to destroy footpath surfaces and block access to pedestrian means of travel.  We hope this committee will find a means of addressing this situation in a meaningful way. <\/p> <p>  We attest to the damage done by the practice of pavement parking.  Pedestrians rely on footpaths to be safe and free of obstacles that could force them into the road.  Parking on footpaths directly affects those with mobility difficulties, those who are blind or visually impaired, anyone walking with pushchairs, children, guide dogs or using mobility aids.  Pavement parking deprives people of their liberty, significantly reducing their options for freedom of movement.  It is an injustice that has a real effect on people.  It particularly affects the people to whom we should want to afford the most protection and it deprives them of some very basic rights to lead fulfilled lives and participate in public life.  We are regularly contacted by people highlighting examples of illegal parking and how it negatively affects their everyday lives, from parents of children attending and residents living near busy schools and multiple business owners in the city centre, to those in villages in the county who cannot safely walk or cross the road due to the presence of illegally parked cars.<\/p><p>These examples are so widespread and constant that they indicate a general disrespect for the law and a lack of concern at enforcement.  Laws which fail to protect the vulnerable and are routinely ignored undermine public confidence in our justice system.<\/p><p> The Limerick Pedestrian Network accepts that no one solution to the problem of dangerous and illegal parking on footpaths and in cycle lanes exists but that a multifaceted approach involving education, enforcement and improved street design is required.  We welcome the opportunity to present a few proposed solutions and urge the members of the committee to consider them for action.  <\/p><p> Some of the things we are talking about include a continuation and upgrading of the ongoing Road Safety Authority, RSA, campaign against dangerous parking; increased enforcement and resources including community policing and online reporting; increased level of fines including ring-fencing revenue; increased use of penalty points for dangerous parking; improved street design and public realm; and following on from examples in the UK, a valuable first intervention may be to highlight particular zones for a zero-tolerance approach to pavement parking.<\/p><p>We would be happy to talk about any of those at this session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#D00700","nonspeaker":"Dr. Madeleine Lyes","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I invite members to come in at this stage.

We are in a situation, and have been for many years, where Dublin Bus drivers, cyclists and other road users have to share bus lanes.  Hopefully that will become a thing of the past to a certain extent as we roll out the BusConnects network, not only across Dublin but across our other major cities.  Could Ms Keane outline the training drivers undergo before they take to the road on how they interact with and ensure the safety of cyclists as they engage with them on our bus lanes, primarily in Dublin?  How often do they receive refresher training on that aspect of their driving?  When a cyclist or other vulnerable road user reports an incident that causes them serious concern or in some cases injury, what are the reporting mechanisms within Dublin Bus?   I ask because my experience of engaging with Dublin Bus is that I send an email, receive an acknowledgement of the email but no further account of what transpired as a result of that email.  It would be helpful for cyclists and other road users to receive some sort of information as to what transpired after the event.  It would serve to build more confidence in Dublin Bus and its drivers, in the knowledge that they are aware of the vulnerability of the people they encounter on bus lanes every day.<\/p> <p>  I thank the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the extraordinary work they do in ensuring the safety of all road users on a daily basis.  It is a challenging job at the best of times.  A cultural issue exists where the vast majority of road users do not consider illegal parking to be a major problem or that there are any victims of it.  Equally, I would argue that the tendency at times of some members of the force to park illegally lends to that cultural belief.  Could the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outline when and where it is acceptable for a member in a Garda vehicle to park in a bus lane, in a cycle lane or on a footpath?  What are the circumstances when that can happen?  <\/p> <p>  The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2019, SI 495 of 2019, provides that a \"driver shall not overtake or attempt to overtake if to do so would endanger or cause inconvenience to a pedal cyclist\".  Do members of the force receive any specific training on how to enforce that element of our road traffic legislation?  If so, how often do they receive refresher courses on or reminders of that legislation?  My experience and that of other road users is of a significant inconsistency of approach across the force in various parts of the country as to how that legislation is enforced.  In some cases, I argue there is little or no knowledge of that legislation in some Garda stations.  I know that from engaging directly with road users who have reported instances of close passing and close overtaking and have found that the member they are reporting it to is not aware of this legislation.<\/p> <p>  Does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na see any value in the creation of an online portal where members of the public, including motorists, cyclists or other road users, could quickly and efficiently upload dashcam evidence of dangerous driving to aid the Garda to enforce road safety legislation?  This has been successfully implemented in parts of the UK.  A couple of years ago senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met with those who worked to introduce this provision in the UK, whereby dashcam footage can be uploaded to an online portal.  An expert group or unit within the force can immediately assess whether an offence has taken place and take subsequent action.  Does it see a value in implementing something similar here?

We have also responded to new technology as it becomes available and have introduced an integrated innovative virtual reality technology that simulates the cycling experience for our drivers.  This was intended to deliver a better understanding of the challenges facing cyclists.  It was very well received within our training programme and is an important part of the course.<\/p><p>The issue of cyclist safety is also dealt with comprehensively as part of mandatory refresher training for all drivers, which takes place every two years, and drivers receive an annual certificate in professional competence, CPC, every year.<\/p><p> There are a number of training programmes we go through, and I would stress that the practical element includes an on-the-road assessment of driving style, where drivers are assessed against a standard set of core skills using the company's vigil vanguard driver training system.  The core skills reflect a variety of important messages in relation to cyclist safety.  This is a crucial part of the driver training programme.  Drivers also receive updated handbooks, and information posters are displayed where there are legislative or other changes during periods between training.  We also have a training video, which further increases driver awareness around cyclist safety, awareness around other road users and other sorts of changed conditions.  They are just some of the measures on the training side that I would like to outline.<\/p><p> I would like to address the second part of the question, if I have time, relating to the complaints system.  We take any complaints very seriously.  They are thoroughly investigated within Dublin Bus and corrective action is introduced.  That might include refresher training if something has come up in relation to a particular driver or if road conditions have changed at a particular junction.  That is introduced into the programme.<\/p><p> To give some context, which may be useful, we operate around 7,000 trips per day.  We carry 120 million journeys every year post Covid and we monitor the incidence of cyclist issues very carefully.  Sixty-eight incidents have taken place so far in 2022, but I would stress that they include both collisions and incidents involving a cyclist.  They could range from an altercation to a cyclist falling off and causing a driver to brake harshly.  There may not necessarily have been any interaction.  All of these issues are recorded regardless of blame or culpability with the intention of learning and improving from all of them.<\/p><p> I also make the point that under our direct award contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA, we are required to report all of these issues to the NTA.  We also have our own safety board subcommittee within Dublin Bus which takes all of these issues very seriously.  It is a formal subcommittee of the board and we report not only internally but also to the board on these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#E00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":430,"content":"<p>Thank you, Ms Keane.

The online portal in many ways dovetails with stuff those from Dublin Bus have talked about, such as automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, and some of the stuff the Garda representatives mentioned in their submission about section 81 of the Road Traffic Act.  We have lots of cameras.  We have 14 cameras on Dublin Bus.  I will admit, given my constant talking about data protection and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, I would prefer a system where a driver has to trigger it instead of constant passive surveillance by Dublin Bus, which is slightly off-putting.  Certainly, an online portal for reporting these things and providing evidence has worked well in our neighbouring jurisdiction, and I would love to know why it cannot happen here.  Again, as cycling advocates such as Deputy Cannon have said, we see it for road traffic offences so why not for cycling offences?<\/p> <p>  The witnesses make the point in terms of section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 that it is not possible to use CCTV to enforce parking or driving in bus lanes or cycle lanes.  There is a list of offences for which CCTV can be used.  These include careless driving, parking in a dangerous position and dangerous driving.  Surely, given the evidence we have heard from other witnesses that parking or driving in a bus lane or cycle lane is careless driving at the very least, or in some cases dangerous driving, and would certainly meet the category of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position, can we not use section 81 of the Road Traffic Act to enforce those behaviours through those bits of legislation which are allowed, which then brings us back to the portal?  One of the frustrations is that, any time we talk about these kinds of issues, for example, with a local authority, we are told it is an enforcement issue.  Here we have tools for enforcement that we see work, whether it is ANPR, a photograph taken by a bus driver, or an online portal, and we even seem to have a nice bit of legislation, so I would love to more about why that is not working.<\/p> <p>  I have one more question.  There has been talk in some of the submissions about the culture of impunity in relation to this.  I would love to hear how that looks on the ground in practical terms.

It is part of our digital strategy and part of our digital evidence management system, DEMS, which we are currently rolling out.  It links with other pieces of work and it will be reliant on both funding and confirmation of the legislation - the digital devices Bill - currently being developed and it will be subject to procurement and a better understanding of the product that we require.  We have looked at other jurisdictions as well so we are not sitting waiting for this and are preparing to have an online portal.  In many other jurisdictions it is not solely a matter of people uploading.  People need to make a report, they will get a link and they will upload that.  Being realistic, it will in all likelihood be 2024 before that will be going live for us.  I was speaking to our chief information officer just to get an update in anticipation of that question being asked.  However, we are totally committed to it.  More life is online and video technology is used.<\/p> <p>  In the interim to try to do what we can with what we have currently, we are going to relaunch our traffic watch system.  That means we are going to do some internal work where those reports will go straight into our CAD centres, our control centres.  Currently, they go into our telephone system.  Moving them to control centres that operate 24-7 will allow those to be considered in a much more timely manner.  Again, we are looking at the first or second quarter at the start of next year, so we will do that in the interim but with our full commitment to that because we recognise and hear, and that is what they have in other jurisdictions.<\/p> <p>  Second, I agree very much with what Deputy Costello said about enhanced powers, and as we have heard today with all this and the safety issue, it is a collaborative approach with other partners but using technology where we can.<\/p><p>Many other jurisdictions have a clear use of technology and enforceable powers where people park in bus or cycle lanes.  I hear what Deputy Costello is saying about dangerous parking and other potential road traffic offences.  They would each need to be looked at individually to show how they would constitute those offences.  I know that Chief Superintendent Murphy did some research a couple of years ago in terms of other jurisdictions and enforcement of bus lanes, and how that is done totally by technology and in many areas by local authorities.

The question was around the culture of impunity and examples of it on the ground.  Unfortunately I am aware of this from first-hand experience.  I am from the Dooradoyle estate on the south side of Limerick City.  It is a small housing estate of about 160 houses.  Most of the residents, including my own parents, are living there for 50 plus years.  Unfortunately it suffers from rampant illegal parking and footpath parking.  This is primarily due to traffic accessing St. Paul's National School and University Hospital Limerick which are both in close proximity.  Effectively what happens is that for an hour in the morning and for an hour in the evening the residents of that estate are largely under house arrest, or that is how they feel.  This has led to a serious decrease in the quality of life for those people.  They cannot access any of the amenities they need to access by car during those hours.  If they choose to walk they must run a gauntlet of cars parked on the footpath and blocking driveways, and it is hugely disruptive.  They have petitioned An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on numerous occasions to ticket the offenders and that has been done.   Unfortunately it gets watered down over time and the offenders return.  The residents acknowledge the resource limitations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have also tried to engage themselves with some of the offenders only to be met with apathy, false promises and occasionally aggressive behaviour.  It is a problem that seems to be worsening.<\/p> <p>  One of the solutions that we have come here today to propose seems very appropriate for Dooradoyle estate, which is a zero-tolerance zone where periodically a member of the community policing unit would go in and issue tickets and penalty points.  This would prevent recurrence as people would not be able to build up penalty points over time.  The safety and well-being benefits for the residents of Dooradoyle estate would be huge.  If this proves successful it could be a model that could be rolled out to many other affected communities in the country.    <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Buckley"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Buckley for those responses.

I must admit this is not a topic I discuss or have engaged in much so I am very much in a listening role here today.   What comes to mind for me is whether fixed penalty fines and ticketing curb behaviour in the long term.  I know witnesses mentioned educational campaigns and I think of the road traffic campaigns which I would imagine have a big impact on people.  I remember first learning many years ago about how I was blocking a wheelchair user in on a path.  I could not believe that I actually doing that in such a self-centred, selfish way without ever thinking about how my parking was impacting other users of the path or of the road.  Thankfully that awareness gave me the wherewithal to think twice about where and how I was parking.  I am wondering about the impact of educational campaigns on a national scale versus enforcement of fines.  I am sure there has to be a two-pronged approach in some way, but is there research that shows that penalties work?  Human behaviour will often measure risk in a moment so there would have to be someone policing that all day long in a community.  We have heard about one estate but if we multiply that all over the country how do we enforce that?  I would also be apprehensive about the technology piece, even if that could be the answer.  I am wondering what is needed as regards an educational campaign to begin to curb people's actual behaviour.  I know there will still be some people that will break the law regardless of having that awareness and that is where penalties will probably come in for those type of users but how do we get to a point where people's behaviour changes, as with seat belts, drink driving, all of those things?  I am sure that people's awareness probably impacts those more so than penalties.  It is a vague comment really but I am just trying to understand what will curb behaviour.  <\/p> <p>  City planning representatives are not here today in terms of outlining the responsibility they must have in making roads safe for everyone.  When I go abroad I generally rent a bike.  I spent the summer in Portland and I was in a new city that I had never been in before yet I cycled around it at ease, without fear.  I also spent time in Washington.  The bike lanes are in the middle of the roads so nobody can ever park on them and there are kerbs blocking any cars being able to come into them.  It seemed so much safer than my own city, where I will not cycle.  If I can go to a foreign country that I have never visited before and feel fine about it and be happy on the roads, a conversation is obviously needed about responsibility for road safety and safe environments rather than those where a road user thinks \"I will take the risk of parking my car here while I run in to collect the kids from school because I have no other option\".  What is the other option for those parents?   They can be fined all we want but where do we push the problem to in terms of who is responsible for ensuring schools and shop fronts and couriers and delivery drivers have somewhere safe to pull in, in the first place?  It is probably not a direct question but if I could have comments from Ms Hilman and then potentially from Mr. Buckley, Dr. Lyes or Mr. Ferrie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#G00500","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":441,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Ruane for her comments with which  I would agree.  We start off with design and engineering from the outset where we can.  When we do come in with enforcement, even like the example in Limerick, we can bring our community policing team in but what does the design look like outside that school?  If one is going to design something where people cannot park, is there a car park where parents can park to have a longer term solution to that?<\/p> <p>  Superintendent Fallon has some research from the University of Limerick, UL, and I will pass over to him shortly.  From the perspective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how we approach things, I did outline at the outset how we operate.  We are the national unit and we set operations and we communicate those.  Everything is still left to the discretion of the individual garda who goes to the call.  If we look at how we policed Covid-19, the four Es it is very much the same in this space - engagement, explaining, education and then the move on to enforcement.  With enforcement Chief Superintendent Murphy is working with the Department on the introduction of the increased fines.  There are increased fines introduced by the Minister but it is important to have the tools and toolkits that are right for the individual circumstances garda&iacute; find themselves in when they go out to those calls.  Undoubtedly it is also about, as Senator Ruane referenced, engineering and partnership, working with local authorities and how areas are designed.

We have proactively examined in the past six to nine months how we would engage with those target demographics of people who may be at risk.  During that we came upon a really interesting piece.  I want to reassure the committee that there are really passionate people in the roads policing community; their professionalism comes across the table when they speak with great passion about going to those scenes and dealing with the horrific aftermaths that they face on a fairly frequent basis.  One of the sergeants in Limerick developed the Lifesaver educational project.  Last week we agreed that would be rolled out nationally as part of our education programme where we will have a standardised presentation that can be adapted.  Its initial concept was to target transition year students across Limerick but that can be tailored and adapted to industry and Tony has given this presentation to various large companies in the Limerick area.<\/p><p>We did some feedback touching on the impact that is having.  The data we received were a very positive endorsement of that, particularly around getting the voice into those young people, as it were, because they are probably not watching TV.  In my own house nobody watches TV and we are not reading mainstream newspaper media.  How are we going to target that?  It is tailor made and the advantage for us that we are really excited about is that it will be standardised and we will have lifesaver project ambassadors.  For all the pain points we are seeing, there is the opportunity to raise awareness of that.  There is a reality, as was alluded to, that at certain times you do not realise the damage you are causing.  There is an onus on us not just in terms of the enforcement piece but the education piece and bringing people with us because, as the Commissioner has alluded to, this is very much a shared responsibility.  It will not all be done by garda&iacute; alone.  Likewise, everyone has a social responsibility.  Certainly in terms of the education piece, we are quite excited by it and think it will have a real impact.  It has had so far and it has been delivered the project to something in the region of 50,000 people.  We are quite enthused by that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#G00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Se&aacute;n Fallon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":444,"content":"<p>I thank everybody for their presentations.  Not being from Dublin, maybe I have a different attitude to a lot of this stuff.  I do drive around the city, however, and I see what is happening.  I do not see much evidence of people driving in bus lanes, which is quite good, but I agree they should be made 24 hour.  I use bus lanes outside of the times they are in operation, but it makes a lot of sense for them to be 24 hour and that should be rolled out.  It would make a lot of sense in terms of safety.<\/p> <p>  I take what the Garda witnesses say about education and stuff.  That is vitally important.  What you do see an awful lot of is people parking in bus lanes and cycle lanes.  Before I came to the meeting, I saw on Twitter that somebody had pointed out to garda&iacute; that there was a car parked blocking the path where they were pushing a pram, and the garda just said it was illegal and drove off without doing anything about it.  That kind of stuff does not work and defeats the whole purpose, now that that tweet has gone out and hundreds of thousands of people have seen it.  There is a need for an enforcement role to take place in the meantime, because if we wait for the Government and the local authorities to roll out proper educational programmes, we will be waiting a long time, unfortunately.  There is a need for that enforcement role to take place actively, because I know from personal experience that if you know you are likely to get done on a certain section of road or you have got done before for something, that is going to make a difference as to whether you do it again.  That is the reality of the situation.  Even if you hear that somebody else has got done or something like that, that makes a difference and it gets out there.  That is vitally important, and while we wait for the rollout of the education courses, that has to happen in terms of building people's respect for the law and for pedestrian safety.  I would probably be guilty of it myself at times too, so it is very important we do that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#H00300","speaker":"1547"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":445,"content":"<p>I want to respond to Senator Ruane and Deputy Pringle on the enforcement and education pieces.  The education piece through the RSA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everyone else has been going on a long time and we are all aware of it.  Some of us with young kids see a lot of it as well.  Parallel to the education, however, there are many people, as the Deputy said, who will remember receiving a ticket for speeding or otherwise on a section of road and will slow down.  Enforcement is very important.  It hammers things home and supports the education.  It shows we are educating people on this but that there are consequences.  If there are no consequences, people do not care.  They will run the gauntlet, take the risk and park in the cycle lane for two minutes.  They will speed down the road because they are late or in a hurry, and if there are no consequences, they will continue to do that.<\/p> <p>  Somebody mentioned impunity.  One good example of evidence of enforcement is the average speed cameras on the new M7, which are also in the Dublin Port tunnel with 99% compliance.  Before speed cameras were introduced on the M7, speeding compliance was about 60%, so about 40% were consistently breaking the speed limits.  That improved once they were installed.  It improved from 60% to 89% before they were active, and once they were activated, that compliance increased beyond 90%.  It is very clear that, along with the education and telling people to behave and how to behave, enforcement is very important to get the message across.  If there is no penalty, there is no crime, there are no consequences, and people will continue to do it until they get caught and there are consequences.  Both points were well made and I think enforcement should follow hand in hand with the education piece.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#H00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peter Collins"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":446,"content":"<p>As outlined, our experience and what we have seen from working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to introduce those average speed cameras is that people change behaviours.

When I went to school in the 1980s, there were bike sheds.  I spoke to a teacher in one school recently and he told me five out of 500 pupils in this Kerry school cycle.  In another school, three out of 300 cycle.  None of those were teenage girls.  In 2016, 70% of Kerry children went to primary school by car, which is 10% more than the previous census.  There has been an 87% decrease between 1996 and 2011 in people cycling to secondary school.  In the whole of the State, I think 700 teenage girls cycle to school compared with 19,000 in 1986.  I remember bringing one of my children to school on the bike and one of the parents at the school gate saying to me she did not know I was off the road, which I was not by the way, for the record - not yet anyway.<\/p> <p>  A total of 90% of the cyclists going to school seem to be male and consequently there is a big traffic problem outside many schools, in Killarney and Tralee in particular.  I spoke to a garda recently and asked him to send someone to monitor what was going on, because I do not think you can go straight into schools and start handing out fines.  Parents would have to be given fair warning.  The Garda put down cones at one school and one person came along and started parking her car there.  When someone pointed what she was doing, she said she thought she was being guided into the spot as opposed to not being allowed park there.<\/p> <p>  The assistant commissioner mentioned an interagency response, and it might have been mentioned by a few people.  That is important, because none of the cycle lanes in Kerry seem to be a different colour, which is important.<\/p><p>Most of the greenways currently being built in Kerry are guided towards tourism in rural rather than urban areas where people actually use them.  It is really only an accident that some of them, at the beginning or the end of the routes, have become very successful urban greenways or cycleways.<\/p><p> I think Mr. Collins mentioned the planning situation and the inclusion of drop-offs.  One school in Tralee was recently refurbished but no provision was made for people to drop off their children in a good way.  I welcome the comments by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on enforcement.  When the garda&iacute; came to the school that day, they had to go away because the unit staffing was down from 13 garda&iacute; a couple of years ago to nine now.  Seven of the garda&iacute; in that unit were required in court on a District Court day on a Wednesday in Tralee, so the garda&iacute; had to leave before parents came to the school at that time.  No more than during Covid, it is important to engage with people and, as Commissioner Harris always says, police by consent rather than going straight in because that would not go down well.<\/p><p> I am not so sure about the 24-hour bus lanes as someone who drives in and out of Dublin every other day, sometimes at 11 p.m or 12 midnight.

If people drop their children off and park illegally, what is the alternative?  What do we do?  It is important to realise this a bit of a vicious cycle.  People are driving their children to school because it is unsafe for them for them to walk or cycle, but by driving their children to school they are adding to the safety issues on the roads.  The issues of enforcement and infrastructure have to be tackled.  We have to provide children with the option of cycling to school.<\/p> <p>  A very good measure of how safe our roads are is the number of children cycling to school.  We often hear about the number of fatalities and that is an important measure of road safety but when we compare Ireland with somewhere like the Netherlands, for example, 75% of secondary school students there cycle to school.  In Ireland, as members will know, that number is approximately 5%.  It is very low, although it may have increased in the past few years.  From our perspective, that tells its own story about the perception of safety on the roads.  As a result of that perception, more people are driving because they believe that is the safest way to get their children to school.  That is the issue that has to be tackled.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":459,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Deputy Leddin who has an interest in this issue and is attending the committee for the purpose of today's deliberations.

As I said, it is critically important.  I get the sense that many people in this room do not understand just how critically important it is.<\/p> <p>  We have a chronic situation with respect to illegal parking on bus lanes, cycle lanes and footpaths.  Mr. Ferrie's point about the impact of this is that it ultimately deters people from walking, cycling or using the bus.  One of the greatest challenges we have is to get people to use those modes of transport.  Unless we take it very seriously when other road users impinge on people's ability to use those modes, we will not succeed in this great challenge we face.  By the way, I do not want to say that this failure is simply down to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be wrong of me to say that.  The failure is that of the Government and local authorities.  We have to accept that this is failure.  It is total failure and we need to sort it out.<\/p> <p>  I am very happy to hear from Mr. Buckley and I welcome my county compatriots to today's meeting.  What Mr. Buckley described in Dooradoyle is repeated everywhere on practically every street in the country.  I would like to see a trial in Dooradoyle but I would also like to see us get beyond trials very quickly because we are in this chronic situation.  We can talk about the four Es of engagement, explaining, education and enforcement but the latter really has to happen now because it has not been happening.  I welcome the earlier comments about the launch of the portal in 2024.  It will be very interesting to hear how that is shaped.  We have to get it right.  Is there any legislative barrier to implementing that portal system?  The road traffic Bill is going through the Oireachtas at present.  We have to get that right.  I want the representatives to tell us what is needed in that Bill, so we can help them get that portal.<\/p> <p>  On the discussion of the ANPR technology by Dublin Bus, I am very encouraged by the strong suggestion that we need this technology and we need to roll it out quickly to get the buses moving.  I heard similar from Dublin Bus's colleagues in Bus &Eacute;ireann at a private meeting I had with its representatives.  I want to see us roll out this technology.  It will make the jobs of garda&iacute; easier if we do so.

We have a situation where local authorities throughout the country have very different approaches to this.

There is also the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing road traffic offences.  The NTA has a role as regulator for the taxi industry and, to a certain extent, in respect of the detail and design of roads.  This creates a real issue, certainly in Dublin, where there are four local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NTA and there are offences that fall through the cracks.  Dublin Street Parking Services is responsible for enforcing parking in Dublin city centre but it often says it cannot enforce a particular matter and one needs to get in touch with the Garda on it.  Obviously, the Garda has to make decisions in respect of its resources and the issues on which it focuses, and it may consider the matter is not high on its list of priorities.  A simplification of that system such that is a clear definition of responsibilities in terms of who enforces the law and how they do so is needed, as well as an increase in the resources to do that.

That could be done in a manner similar to the enforcement of bus lanes in Belfast, where a local government agency undertakes that role.

I understand why people adversely impacted by this issue have questions regarding the technology having been rolled out for quite some time in respect of speeding but not in respect of bus lanes.  Ms Keane outlined clearly in her submission what it entails and that is in use in other jurisdictions, yet it appears we are pushing an open door today and there are no budgetary restraints or obstacles in the way.  Is my understanding correct?  I do not wish to ask the witnesses to trespass on the political arena, but where do they see that issue?  Ms Keane was very enthusiastic about it and the trials that have happened.  It would make a difference.  I detect a harmonious approach from all the contributors today but I ask them to drill down among the harmony.  People impacted by the illegal use of bus lanes do not have the extra vigilance and enforcement that others enjoy, yet we all seem to be on the same page in respect of that issue.

I will provide detail on the position of Dublin Bus and then pass to our colleagues from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To reiterate the points made earlier, we are now at a time when technology and the transport industry are significantly integrating.  This creates an opportunity.  In particular, we are talking about automatic number plate recognition.  Dublin City Council trialled fixed artificial intelligence, AI, pole cameras in 2020 and 2021, although we understand that was not for the purposes of enforcement.  If there was consensus for a pilot exercise for 12 months, that would serve as a proof of concept and a learning opportunity for all parties.  Dublin Bus vehicles are now equipped with up to 14 high-tech cameras, with extremely advanced CCTV quality and recognition features, even compared with the technology five years ago.  That could play a vital role in utilising the technology that is in place to improve the journey for all our customers.  If the trial were to take place on a designated spine, that would ensure alignment with the BusConnects project that is coming in and would allow operators, the authorities and the law enforcement agencies to learn from this.  We do not believe budget would be a constraint on the pilot.  The ability this would bring to improve the average speeds in bus lane timings would more than outweigh any cost of implementing it.  I will pass to my colleagues from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the legislation aspect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Andrea Keane"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":472,"content":"<p>I am at an advanced stage of researching a Bill for regulation of the sale, supply and manufacture of number plates.

I thank them for coming in.  I do not wish to be repetitive but I want to touch on the points made by the witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of social responsibility.  I do not want what I am about to say to be taken as a dismissal of that because, of course, garda&iacute; do not put private cars on bicycle lanes or across driveways, among other things.  There is a little bit of a hierarchy, however, in terms of the approach taken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I know will be admitted.<\/p><p>At certain times, certain things are just not a priority for good reasons.  However, these are big issues.  I have always said, as a parliamentarian for 11 years, that it is the little things that make people happy.  Getting the council to fix a pothole - to be blunt - often makes them a lot happier than a &euro;600 energy credit over the next six months.  There is a need for social responsibility but, in equal measure, there is a need to take these matters seriously when it is possible to do so.<\/p><p> I want to stress the point about enforcement outside of schools.  I am fortunate to live in Malahide where we had one of the first school street projects in the country, which is well over two years old.  It was met with quite a bit of resistance along the way but it is up and running and is very successful.  There has been being a massive increase in the number of children walking and cycling to school in Malahide, which I am thrilled to see.  However, parking across driveways for 15 or ten minutes still causes issues on certain streets around schools.  The core of Malahide is a couple of hundred years old, therefore, the houses are not young, which invariably means the age profile of the occupants of the houses is a little bit older.  These issues are a big deal to them.  It means they cannot get out of their homes.  In general terms, not specifically Malahide, that hierarchy of approach needs to be looked at.  If there are things we need to do in these Houses to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we should do them.  Everything we do in these Houses should support safer road usage and safer facilities for pedestrians and cyclists alike.  We are getting to the point where we will be able to improve that across the board but, unfortunately, we are coming at it ten, 20 or even 30 years too late in certain instances.  It is a cultural thing which we need to change.  Covid lockdown was a great help in that process.  While it was a tragic set of circumstances for thousands of families, it also gave us an opportunity to take stock again of certain things and that is something which we will all benefit from in the end.<\/p><p> I do not have specific questions for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na other than to note that if we are going to do this together at Government, Oireachtas and local authority level, then when it is pointed out, it is like the nose on one's face.  All members have mentioned reporting matters to the Garda when it is in front of them and one member mentioned that the garda drove off.  While the garda may have been on an important job, the fact is we must acknowledge that these little matters are meaningful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#K01300","speaker":"1562","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>I support everything the Deputy said.

First, I endorse what has been said about reporting.  It is true of any crime that if people do not feel reports are being taken seriously, they will stop making reports as they will feel they are wasting their time.  I endorse what has been said.<\/p> <p>  As a cyclist, I probably do not report enough when I have had close calls.  A number of my friends who have GoPro cameras have shown me footage of close calls and negative experiences they have had with all types of motorists and even other cyclists.  In that regard, the portal is tremendously interesting but it comes with evidential challenges, of which the Garda will have to take stock.  Extra instructions may need to be given to members of the Garda on how quickly they must act on this information, how they will preserve it and make it ready for presentation in court if and when that becomes necessary.  It is a positive opportunity to ramp up enforcement and send out a clear message that people who are cavalier with other people's lives, which is what it comes down to, will not be able to walk away from it.<\/p> <p>  I accept the bona fides of what has been said about the Garda attitude to these things.  I confess it has not been my experience.  Comments have been made about Garda driving.  I work in the criminal courts.  I am aware there is huge demand for Garda parking in the surrounds of courts and Garda stations.  Sometimes, some members of the Garda do not live up to what we expect of them in terms of driving and parking.  It is not a general criticism of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but there are some members who could be reminded of the situation.<\/p> <p>  I acknowledge what was said about the number of cameras on buses.  I have a difficulty with the idea that the Garda was using bus footage as an enforcement mechanism.  The Garda can use bus footage in the same way it can use footage from an individual cyclist, pedestrian or bystander.  Bus footage does not have any superior evidential status.<\/p><p>It appears that there is a wealth of bus footage that could be used and co-operation between Dublin Bus and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be hugely beneficial.<\/p><p> There are parts of my area where we have extremely high-quality cycling facilities.  I am thinking of Frascati Road, for example, where there is a bypass to Blackrock up to a point but unfortunately, it is patchy.  As one goes along Rock Road, cyclists and buses share the same space and I am not sure that all Dublin Bus drivers understand that.  Cyclists come in different categories and along that route there are some very fast commuter cyclists who just want to get there but there are also more vulnerable people who are slow.  There are also people going to school, both children and parents, and I am not sure that all bus drivers understand that driving close to those people is not on, either behind them or next to them.  I appreciate what has been said about the education provided for bus drivers but I have felt under pressure sometimes when there has been a very big bus right behind me.  I am not a fast cyclist.  I have a Dutch bike and it takes its time, unfortunately.  When a bus is right up behind people it can really put them under pressure.  The witnesses have said that there is experiential training for bus drivers, which I welcome, but it would be good to repeat the message to them that they have a role to play when they are sharing road space with cyclists.  <\/p><p> I also want to endorse what Mr. Ferrie said about school transport and encouraging children to cycle to school.  There are few enough children in my area who cannot cycle to school except for the lack of proper safe facilities.  I was delighted to be involved as a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown with moving a wall on Convent Road, off Carysfort Avenue, to facilitate children going to Carysfort National School.  That hugely increased the number of children who could cycle along that stretch.  We know that if the infrastructure is put in place, it increases the numbers who cycle to school.  Some schools are doing their best and on the whole, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown has shown itself to have a very good track record in putting infrastructure in place but it is still patchy.  In the same way that the Rock Road, Frascati Road corridor is patchy, the same is true around some schools.  Local authorities need to step up to the mark and central Government needs to support them financially to do so.<\/p><p> Finally, I am not in favour of 24-hour bus lanes because we do not have 24-hour bus services.  There are places in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown with bus lanes, for example, Rowanbyrn along the Monkstown link road, where there is no bus service to speak of at all.  If the bus service matches the bus lanes in terms of frequency and the time during which it operates, that is fine but at the moment we do not have 24-hour bus services so I do not see the merit in having 24-hour bus lanes.  <\/p><p> I thank all of our contributors for their time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#L00900","speaker":"1685","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":488,"content":"<p>Thank you very much Senator.

We were all walking and cycling more and became aware, as we had to avoid people on paths, just how narrow many of our footpaths are and how little space there is on them.  This led to Limerick Pedestrian Network launching a We Need Space campaign in Limerick, with limited success.  I agree that there has been much more emphasis since lockdown on the need for pedestrian and cyclist space.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Eoin Buckley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":490,"content":"<p>I would like to make one point in response to Senator Ward's comments on 24-hour bus lanes.  This is an issue that also arises with cycle lanes.  When cycle lanes are not 24-hour, it increases the instances of people parking in them outside of the set times.  In surveys we have done, there are higher levels of people parking in cycle lanes either side of the cut-off times.  People over-stay the time on the lanes and if, for example, it is nearly 12 o'clock, they just park in the lanes.  We believe that 24-hour cycle lanes and bus lanes would remove any ambiguity about whether drivers can park in them and would lead to better compliance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Thank you.

At the outset I thank all of the stakeholders for coming here this afternoon and participating in this very worthwhile discussion.  It has been a very interesting meeting.  As a culchie and someone who comes from the country, I would take cognisance of what my learned friends from the city have to say on these issues but I was in Amsterdam recently and found the infrastructure there for cyclists and pedestrians very relaxing.  It felt very safe to be there.  As someone who comes from the country and drives into the city of Dublin two or three days a week, I find it can be quite challenging because it is so busy and there is so much going on.  Drivers have to be very alert at all times and to be cognisant of the fact that there are cyclists using the roadway as well.  Mention was made earlier of a public information campaign which would not be a bad thing.<\/p> <p>  I was interested in the points made about the use of technology.  We can talk about education and information campaigns and the altering or retrofitting of existing road infrastructure to accommodate pedestrians and cyclists but that is a slow burner.  When it comes to the use of technology, reference was made to the port tunnel, where the compliance rate with the speed limits is in the high 90s.  I use the port tunnel regularly and it is amazing to see the impact of the technology there on road users.  One knows that the technology is there and that if one goes beyond the speed limit, one will end up with a fine and penalty points.  It is amazing how that message hits home and perhaps there is a wider role for technology in terms of getting a quick hit on these other issues.<\/p> <p>  I have a number of questions for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Are offences in these areas on the increase?  What is the trend there, year on year?  Where does technology fit into this in the context of GDPR?  Is there an obstacle there or is it a cause of delays?  Is satisfying GDPR requirements an issue in the context of the use of technology to detect road offenders? <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUJ2022100400002#M00600","speaker":"1658"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":493,"content":"<p>I will take those questions.

Last year, there were over 6,500 tickets issued and this year, to date, over 5,500 have been issued for various parking offences.  We are seeing an increase right across the country.  The majority of tickets are issued in Dublin, particularly in the city environment, followed by our southern region, including Cork.
