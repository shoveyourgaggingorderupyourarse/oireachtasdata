I am executive director of Electric Ireland, which is the retail division of the ESB.  I am joined by two colleagues.  Suzanne Ward is on my right and David Vickers is on my left.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on three areas.  First, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s role as a supplier in the Irish electricity market; second, I will summarise why electricity prices have increased over the past 18 months, and third, I will detail how Electric Ireland is supporting our customers during these challenging times.  In addition, as requested by the committee, I will briefly cover ESB Group's profitability as set out in our recently published interim results for the half-year to 30 June 2022.<\/p> <p>  There are approximately 2.2 million residential electricity customers in the Republic of Ireland.  Electric Ireland, as Ireland&rsquo;s largest electricity supplier, has in the region of 1.1 million residential electricity customers and 170,000 residential gas customers.  Electric Ireland also serves the SME and large energy user segments of the market, with an overall market share across the residential and business segments of approximately 40%.<\/p> <p>  The ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately so that increased profits from the ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  This means that Electric Ireland must operate in the residential market as an entirely stand-alone supplier, buying electricity and gas from the wholesale market to meet customer demand.<\/p> <p>  Turning to price increases, the electricity price for customers is made up of wholesale electricity costs, network or infrastructure costs, government policy regarding public service obligation, PSO, charges, VAT and the costs associated with operating as a supplier in the market.  Over the past year, the significant increases in customers&rsquo; bills have been driven by extraordinary and sustained increases in the wholesale price of electricity.  Such increases in Ireland have been driven primarily by unprecedented increases in wholesale gas prices in Britain and across the EU, driven by concerns over European gas supply, made much more acute as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and reduced Russian gas supply.  Wholesale gas forward prices have increased by more than 1,000% over the past 18 months.  This is an unprecedented level of increase.  Two years ago, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s annual wholesale energy costs were in the region of &euro;300 million.  At current market levels, we expect that cost to increase to around &euro;2 billion.<\/p> <p>  Electric Ireland hedges its wholesale costs to remove uncertainty and to stabilise retail prices for our customers.  We typically begin hedging about 18 to 24 months before delivery, and progressively increase our hedge position over time.  This approach protects our customers from short-term volatility by smoothing out cost movements over time.  In more normal wholesale conditions, this approach would be expected to result in small price adjustments, either increases or decreases, depending on the market movements each year.  In conditions where the wholesale market sustains at extraordinary levels, however, retail prices will eventually trend upwards as hedges expire and suppliers have to buy or hedge future purchases of electricity at prevailing elevated prices.<\/p><p>Hedging is the reason residential customer prices have increased gradually over a number of iterations rather than in sudden changes that reflect the real-time volatile nature of the wholesale energy market.<\/p><p> I will now talk about Electric Ireland's pricing and customer protection activities in this difficult period.  Electric Ireland is very aware that these price increases are difficult for customers to absorb.  We are committed to helping our customers during these challenging times.  We have maintained a lower standard variable tariff, SVT, for electricity than almost all competitors across the past 18 months.  We continue to offer enduring discounts for all existing customers.  Electric Ireland engages with any residential customers who have difficulty paying their bills and, where required, works with them to put in place manageable payment plans.  Disconnections are, and always will be, a last resort.  There is a regulatory moratorium on disconnections for the winter period for vulnerable customers.<\/p><p> We are also active in providing more specific targeted supports for our most vulnerable customers.  Electric Ireland recently launched another hardship fund of &euro;3 million, similar to the one in place during Covid, which will provide support to Electric Ireland customers who have difficulty paying their bills.  Access and administration of the fund and issuance of energy credits will be managed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  A range of products is also available through home electric+ for those with smart meters installed.  Detailed appliance insights, user data, and accurate monthly billing can all help customers to manage their energy consumption.  Electric Ireland is running extensive advertising campaigns profiling the benefits of smart metering to customers.<\/p><p> Electric Ireland is the designated supplier of last resort for electricity customers and has been instructed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to take on the customers of Bright Energy, Iberdrola and, more recently, Panda Power, all of which have exited the market.  This has significant implications for Electric Ireland, not least having to buy additional energy for these customers at current market prices.  However, we will endeavour to make this transition as easy as possible for customers.<\/p><p> Electric Ireland has always sought to deliver affordable electricity to all customers in Ireland.  The price increases we have had to announce over the past 18 months have been as a direct consequence of the unprecedented increases in international wholesale gas prices.  As we operate as a stand-alone energy supplier in the market, we have no choice but to increase our prices given the quantum of increase in our costs.<\/p><p> The ESB's generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from the ESB's generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  However, group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Electric Ireland will continue to work with customers who are most challenged by these increases.<\/p><p> I will move on to the additional question on ESB Group profits.  I can talk about the published ESB Group financial results, however I am not in a position to discuss specific generation or network issues, other than as published or in the public domain.  The most accurate representation of the ESB's underlying financial performance during the first half of 2022 is the operating profit before exceptional items.  In the first half of 2022 this was &euro;357 million, which compares with an operating profit of &euro;363 million in the first half of 2021.<\/p><p> The ESB has recorded exceptional gains in the first half of 2022.  These gains relate mainly to the technical accounting treatment of financial instruments, for example, mark to market on commodity hedges, and are not cash-related items.  These non-cash gains are not related to the price paid for electricity by customers.<\/p><p> The ESB has more than &euro;17 billion in assets and &euro;5.8 billion of debt.  The company must earn an appropriate level of profit, so that it can service debt, reinvest in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Over the past ten years, the ESB has invested more than &euro;10 billion in energy infrastructure and paid more than &euro;1.2 billion in dividends.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Fenlon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fenlon for his statement.

For context, that equates to &euro;2 million per day, or &euro;14 million this week alone, in profits.  During the course of this session, lasting a couple of hours, we are probably talking about profits running into the hundreds of thousands of euro.  Nevertheless, customers' bills are soaring.  Domestic customers have utility bills this month that are skyrocketing; they are doubling and sometimes trebling.  Business consumers and customers with Electric Ireland have bills that are increasing threefold or sometimes fourfold.  These are unprecedented increases in utility prices.  Does Mr. Fenlon accept how difficult it is for these customers to understand or accept that the blow of these prices cannot be cushioned because of technical accounting or because ESB Group is looking at financing future infrastructure?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#G00500","speaker":"1545"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>We understand that this is a very difficult time for many of our customers who have significant difficulty paying the increased bills.  We are engaging daily with customers who are in difficulty and working with them to help them deal with those increases by putting in place payment plans.  We understand, therefore, that when people hear those profit numbers, they can be difficult to reconcile.  The ESB, as a State-owned company, pays half of its profits back to the State, between a dividend policy of 40% and tax, while the other half funds investment in energy infrastructure, which is critical to delivering not just reliable electricity supply but also the net-zero transition into the future for Ireland.<\/p> <p>  On the scale of the company, we have &euro;17 billion in assets.  The profit at an operating level is similar to that in the half-year period for last year.  From a competitive point of view, our prices - we have continued to try to offer prices that are as competitive as we can - and our standard variable tariffs have tended to be at the lower end of available prices for the past 18 months.<\/p> <p>  We understand the difficulty for customers .

I also want to ask the witnesses about Electric Ireland's customer outreach and whether as an essential service provider, not just a market provider, they think it is effective.  How does Electric Ireland measure customer reaction to its outreach activities?  Has it had any issues identifying vulnerable customers?  Does its outreach involve collaboration with the HSE regarding how to identify vulnerable customers because there are so many of them who are not registered with their provider?  Has Electric Ireland looked at the possibility of issuing monthly bills?  People on low incomes are telling me that they would find it so much easier if they had monthly bills.

My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, quite correctly pointed out the disparity between Electric Ireland's profits and its hardship fund.  As a State-owned company that is giving back all the profits to the State in the first place, for reinvestment by the State, it is necessary to highlight that &euro;3 million is a drop in the ocean and consideration should be given to increasing that fund.  That should be done promptly.<\/p> <p>  I want to know the answers to some technical questions on the overall price of the product Electric Ireland is offering, both gas and electricity.  Has it worked out the impact of the proposal to decouple the gas market from the electricity market and what impact that might have on its customers?<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to the variable, that is, the standing charge that goes from company to company across gas and electricity.  As we found out recently, these are not determined by the CRU.  They are in fact determined by individual companies.  In that sense, again, as a State-owned company, consideration should be given to standardising that charge, lowering it or eradicating it.  That would show to Irish consumers that, as a State entity, Electric Ireland is only interested in supplying a product, whether it is electricity or gas, with the State in mind.  Of course, profits will be made.  I am not suggesting that the standing charge is the basis for the company's profit; it is not.  On that basis, consideration should be given to it.<\/p> <p>  Another question relates to the CRU proposal for peak-time rates, that is, charges would be increased from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and lowered for the rest of the day as a result.

In supplying electricity there is a mixture of fixed costs, including some of the infrastructure costs, as well as costs in running the supply business.  There are also variable costs which is purely the amount consumed.  So there is a mix and there is always a balance between the best way to recover fixed costs versus variable costs.  Our total cost that we recover through customers does not change.  If one goes up, the other will go up by less.   On a combined basis it does not change the amount in terms of the estimated annual bill.  It does vary so if we reduce the standing charge, some customers will benefit for example people with holiday homes which is low usage.  On the other hand other people, who have high volume consumption, particularly families, would pay more if we ended up putting up the unit rate and reducing the standing charge.  There are balancing factors to consider what is the right mix and relative to the market, we have tended to be mid-range as regards of the standing charges that are currently out there in the marketplace.  <\/p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Vickers to answer the other two questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#L01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Pat Fenlon"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":77,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.

Will Mr. Fenlon outline for us what can be done, beyond this &euro;3 million fund, which is really a pittance compared to the challenge that people are facing.  What can be done to protect all of those in vulnerable circumstances?  What can Electric Ireland do to alert its customers to the fact that they can register their vulnerability and, therefore, will be guaranteed that they will not be cut off.

I missed the first couple of speakers and apologise if I cover similar ground.  I return to the hardship fund, which my colleagues have had questions on.  Mr. Fenlon points to the mitigation measures which are in place for vulnerable customers such as the &euro;3 million hardship fund but separately, he mentions that within the broader regulatory framework, the generation and supply aspects of the ESB must be kept separate.  Does that same regulatory separation apply in terms of profits?  To be clear, in the first half of this year ESB had a profit of &euro;679 million.  I join my colleagues in questioning whether there is a regulatory obstacle to it but after today's contributions and the scepticism around the &euro;3 million figure compared to the broader profits, will Electric Ireland now consider increasing that figure of &euro;3 million?<\/p> <p>  In July, it was announced that the standing charge would increase by 11.35%.  My colleague Senator Higgins had exchanges with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities last week and was told that the basis for the standing charge was a socialisation cost and that the regulator stated that where homes are connected to the network, there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers that must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even when the customers use very little electricity such as in a holiday home or because they have upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else.  Perhaps some use solar or photovoltaic, PV, power for their electricity during the day but still require electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation cost, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their homes are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  The increase to the standing charge on your customers' bills does not differentiate nor socialise costs.  Disadvantaged households are facing the same increase.  What is the basis for the increase in the standing charge, in particular with regard to how the regulator describes what such charges should be used for?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#O01100","speaker":"1681"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":120,"content":"<p>If I understand correctly, the Senator asked a question about regulatory separation of profits; about the size of the &euro;3 million fund; and about standing charges.

As for the &euro;3 million fund, a number of people have commented on it and we will keep that under review. It is effectively the second &euro;3 million to be put in place.

As mentioned, our bills structure has a fixed component as a standing charge and a variable component which is a unit rate.

Perhaps the Senator is referring to our prior price increase, where we increased both the standing charge and the unit rate.  We did that when we assessed the quantum of costs that we were trying to recover.  We decided that it was a better allocation of those costs to put some of it on the standing charge and less of it on the unit rate.  It does not go to generate any extra net revenue for us as a business.

Does the reason for this relate to general data protection regulation, GDPR, restrictions, and have our guests spoken to the Data Protection Commissioner to see whether there are ways in which, during a crisis of this nature, we can get round some of those GDPR restrictions that might be in place?  It is in all of our interests that people have the opportunity not only to reduce their bills but also to switch their electricity use to the time when renewables are on the system.<\/p> <p>  The ESB is significantly increasing its daytime rate for those who use smart meter charges and the very low rate applies at between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.  It is difficult for consumers to regulate their consumption to have peaks between those hours.  Can it be made a little more user-friendly, perhaps even by changing the times in order that when there is plenty of renewable energy, the company will not charge consumers an excessive rate?

It has increased over the past while, so a briefing note on it would be most welcome.<\/p> <p>  I will turn to an issue also raised by my colleague, Senator Dooley, namely, that of customers being told to use appliances at off-peak times - we have seen those rates increase over the past while - and what was said about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. being the hours for the cheapest rates for some of the tariffs Electric Ireland is offering.  That has, for example, implications for multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, where everyone is running machines.  We then get complaints regarding noise.  We obviously have to consider more social hours.  However, people who are trying their best to consume less energy, and at the most beneficial times as regards charges, feel snookered right now because they are being told to use energy off peak but off-peak rates are going up at a rate of knots.  I ask for an answer to that.<\/p> <p>  I note that &euro;3 million has been set aside for the hardship fund.  How many customers does Electric Ireland expect to avail of that?  The company has earmarked that amount.  It would be interesting to hear what its expectation is in that regard.

I am joined by Mr. Joe Duignan, the regulation and commercial manager for ESB Networks.  We welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee about our central role in facilitating the transition to a net-zero society and achieving the targets set out in the Government's climate action plan.<\/p><p>This is a time of significant concern for both industrial and domestic customers, with large increases in the cost of electricity and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, together with concerns about security of supply.  It is more important than ever that Ireland accelerates its climate action response and achieves improved energy security based on a low-carbon energy system.<\/p><p> I am briefly going to explain ESB Networks&rsquo; role in the electricity sector and then I will cover a few key points on renewable connections.  In our submission we also included a few summary points on the national smart metering programme and our national networks local connections programme.  Both of these programmes are building blocks for the energy transition and the electrification of heat and transport but in the interest of time I do not plan to cover them in this introduction, although I am happy to take any questions on them from members.<\/p><p> I mention the role of ESB Networks.  ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network.  We also build and maintain the electricity transmission network, the planning and operation of which is the responsibility of EirGrid.  Since 1999, these licensed activities have been overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  ESB Networks is a ring-fenced part of ESB Group and there is strict regulatory separation between ESB Networks and the areas of ESB Group responsible for generating and selling electricity.  ESB Networks has served all electricity customers for 95 years and we have a proud history of delivery and innovation.  We work every day to deliver electricity safely and reliably to all customers, irrespective of who they buy their electricity from.  We provide a 24-7 emergency response.  During outages in severe weather, our crews work to restore electricity to affected areas as soon as is it is safe to do so.<\/p><p> We have approximately 2.4 million customers and to give a scale of the network we have: 158,000 km of overhead lines; 27,000 km of underground cables; and 670 high-voltage substations.  Approximately 30,000 new customers connect to the network every year.  The CRU approves the electricity network investment and operation expenditure through five-year contracts called price reviews.  ESB Networks invested &euro;5.3 billion over the past decade and during the period of the price review from 2021 to 2025, which is Price Review 5, we plan to invest &euro;4.4 billion in electricity infrastructure.  Each year our investment programme is delivered through our 3,400 employees and specialist contractors, and is supported by a global supply chain.<\/p><p> I will move to ESB Networks and climate action.  The electricity distribution system is evolving to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030.  The electrification of heat, transport and our economy will see citizens and businesses adopting low carbon technologies, including heat pumps, electric vehicles, and microgeneration such as roof top solar.  ESB Networks is at the centre of the transition to a low carbon energy society, and we are proud of our leading role in this transformation.  In fully supporting the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, ESB Networks has delivered all our lead actions to date and we are supporting the progress and delivery of many other actions.<\/p><p> I will make some final comments on connecting renewables to the electricity network.  Ireland and ESB Networks have a strong track record in connecting renewables.  Today there are over 5 GW of renewable generation connected to the electricity system.  We expect to have connected 25 new grid-scale renewable wind and solar projects during 2022, increasing the total to 5.4 GW.  A further four battery energy storage projects are also expected to be connected, totalling 80 MW.  The combination of the Government&rsquo;s renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the regulated connection process is delivering a strong pipeline of projects each year.  These are essential to ensure a steady drumbeat of projects connecting to the system each year between now and 2030 in order to reach the climate action plan targets.  ESB Networks will continue to work in partnership with generators and all key stakeholders to ensure delivery of these targets.<\/p><p> Since 2011, electricity network generators have the option to build their grid connections, except for specific works that ESB Networks must carry out, such as work in live electricity substations.  This gives generators control and choice over who builds their grid connection.  When customers choose ESB Networks to connect a generator to the system, we design the minimum technically acceptable connection method.  Our charges are benchmarked and are approved by the CRU.  Costs vary depending on the upgrade works required.  Regulated charging policy requires that the cost of upgrade works to the network is borne by the generator.<\/p><p> I will finish with some of the recent key achievements in this area.  The year 2022 is likely to be a record year for renewable generation growth, with approximately 700 MW of new renewable generation expected to be connected, bringing the total to 5.4 GW.  We are processing in the region of 90 grid-scale connection projects every year.  These include commercial solar and wind projects, community projects and auto-producers.<\/p><p>We have also put systems in place to allow for electricity suppliers to settle energy payments for microgeneration electricity exported to the grid.  Over 40,000 microgeneration customers are now registered with ESB Networks and we expect many more to do so over the coming years.  In December 2021, in line with the climate action plan of 2021, CAP 21, we launched the mini-generation pilot for connections of less than 50 kW.  We have since extended this to 650 applications.  Last week, we were very pleased to launch a small-scale generation pilot for connections between 50 kW and 200 kW.<\/p><p> In summary, there has been very significant progress in the growth and deployment of renewables and the initial stages of the electrification of heating and transport.  The collective challenge now is to build on the very positive progress to date and to achieve the targets in the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, and beyond that to net zero.  We are happy to take any questions from the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#W00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Tarrant","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":225,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Tarrant.

Sometimes people put it all in one pot.  For the electrical grid connection, as Mr. Tarrant said, the contestability is there.  Customers have been able to elect to do it for the past ten years or more.  The way we do our element is by having what is called \"least-cost technically acceptable\".  We do a technically acceptable method, which is carried out by our planners and specialists, and there are planning standards that are approved by the regulator for that.  We look for the minimum technically acceptable level.  We are not looking for the Rolls-Royce model here.  We are looking for something that works and is safe for people on the network and other users.  Once we have designed that, there is a charge associated with it.  The regulator's policy is that the generator who drives the work pays for it.  Otherwise, it would have to be socialised across other customers and that is not a decision for networks.  That cost is there.  Our generator standard charges were benchmarked internationally with consultants and the regulator.  They are benchmarked with the UK distribution network operators, DNOs, and they come out favourably.  There is consultation by the regulator on this where the industry can put in its charges and compare.

With a high demand period over the winter one tends to minimise outages, which can have an impact as to when one can connect or do work on the transmission system or even the distribution system.  We view the transmission outage programme as a window over the spring, through the summer and into the autumn.  A huge amount of work is still done during the winter period.

Earlier we heard that CRU approved these regulated charges so Electric Ireland plays no role in them.  The network charges have increased so has that been the driver of increased standing charges?  Can the ESB show the network charge on the bills provided to consumers so that they feel there is some element of the increase, which they may have to pay, in terms of the charge for running the network?<\/p> <p>  Does the ESB think that energy companies can do more to make it easier for consumers to opt for solar energy, smart technology, insulation, sharing platforms or electric vehicles?  Can more be done?  We seem to have reached a moment when customers are under a lot of pressure and companies like the ESB need consumer goodwill to roll out infrastructure worth &euro;4.4 billion.  The ESB has a perfect opportunity to step up to the plate and say, \"we are going to help a national energy resilience campaign and help our customers\".  If that were done it would result in a win-win situation because people would see the benefits of having more renewables on the system and allowing networks to be built.  We have heard elsewhere that planning objections have been a big drag on the ESB's system.  This is a moment when the ESB could do a very positive thing that would sell the idea of more renewables on the grid.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#Z00400","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":234,"content":"<p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I shall start by responding to the first question about ensuring network charges and tarriffs appear on bills.<\/p> <p>  The CRU approves network charges because the ESB is a regulator monopoly notwithstanding the point made about contestable connections for renewable generators.  That goes through a process where our revenue is set every year.  As we collect revenue from the suppliers we do not control what goes on the bills that suppliers issue to customers.  We have a certain charge and I ask Mr. Duginan to comment on the exact quantity, say, for the distribution network that is charged and passed on to customers.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy made an important point about building infrastructure and the long-term nature of these investments.  Ultimately a company like ours, and the regulatory model for a company like ours, involves investing over decades and then recovering that money through customers' bills.  For example, the distribution network is over 45 years but the transmission network is over 50 years.  The way to minimise the impact on customer bills in the here and now is to recover that money slowly over time in order to recover those investments.<\/p><p>In the previous session, reference was made to the scale of the network charges.  I ask Mr. Duignan to comment on that and on the wider role we have in the network or the system to do with encouraging decarbonisation.  Perhaps we will come back to that.

As Mr. Tarrant has said, all the charges are approved by the regulator and then we charge them on to suppliers.  How the supplier passes that on is up to them so they can have different bundles and packages and so on.  That is different for them.  With our charges, if we go back one and half years ago before the current situation with the price of electricity, typically the distribution element of the tariff for a customer would be in and around 22% or 23%, or in that ballpark.  It has not moved since in terms of the euro amount.  What has moved is the wholesale price of electricity.  The overall bill has gone up but the distribution element has not.  I would say that this 22% or 23% element has dropped significantly.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the fixed and variable elements.  Again, from a distribution to perspective, our tariff is about one third fixed and two thirds variable.  In other words, one third is a standing charge, on average, across customers, and the other two thirds are variable.  Our actual costs for providing the infrastructure are more fixed than variable.  They are quite low.  In comparison with other European jurisdictions, the trend is to have higher fixed costs for the network element of the bill.  That trend is going up even higher, but ours have been stable now, at about at about 30% or thereabouts, for a while.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Duignan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":237,"content":"<p>There is an absolutely massive change going on in the industry overall, and that is leaving aside the whole volatility that is having a huge impact on customers at the moment with prices.  The whole journey around electrification and achieving the 80% target out to 2030 is a massive challenge for the entire industry.  If one takes the smart metering programme as an example, in respect of which there has been a great deal of discussion and many questions, ultimately, these are building blocks of infrastructure that will enable customers over time to really get value from their energy providers and will be really crucial.  As well as things like the smart metering programme we also have a climate action plan around creating more flexibility for customers in how they manage their demand.  Ultimately, the long-term role of smart metering will support the electrification of transport with people charging the cars at night time, for example, and will support the Government's target of almost 1 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade.<\/p> <p>  The challenge now is to keep working as part of a wider society and to drive on with the change of achieving the 80% target and then on to net zero.  We are planning to play a key role in that.  We are launching a customer portal, for example, to give access to customers of their data in the smart meters later this year and into the new year.

It is safe to say that this area is quite complex.  For customers, it is quite complex.  We had several sessions and we have an understanding of who has responsibility for which area.  Even if one is to look at the climate action framework, several agencies are involved in a lot of those particular areas.  One of those is smart metering.  I believe it is between the ESB and the CRU.  As already indicated, almost 1,000 have smart meters at this stage.  When I asked for details about how many are actually using the tariff, it is actually very low.  Three seems to be an awful long way to go - I believe that 40,000 people are on the best tariff based in the context of their smart meters.  What is being communicated to me is that people are opting to go without the smart meter, and to go another route because they have identified that it is cheaper and particularly for electric vehicle owners, which would be one aspect.  What more can the witnesses do to play their part?  It is pointless having everybody signed up to a smart meter if they are not deriving the benefit from it.<\/p> <p>  The second point relates to renewables.  The ESB has a key responsibility there.  Do the witnesses feel that they are ready for the scale of the challenge, particularly when it comes to offshore wind?  The target is now 7 GW by 2030.  There is a massive amount of work the ESB needs to do in order to be able to facilitate companies investing here.  Where is the ESB at in that regard, and is it ready for the challenge?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#AA00400","speaker":"1693"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":239,"content":"<p>Smart meters are a fundamental foundation for the climate change that is coming.  We are hoping to hit the target of installing 1 million smart meters this month.  By the end of 2024, the vast majority of customers will be on smart meters.  We are at the early stages of people adopting smart tariffs.  Ultimately, by providing data we expect to see more competitive offerings coming in from suppliers, providing different options to suit people's lifestyles.  We expect it to develop and grow.  This is part of a European and even a global change relating to having data available to customers who can use that to best effect.  I know it is easy to say that at the moment because customers are really suffering out there.  However, over the years ahead it will fundamentally change how customers use electricity and engage with their suppliers and the whole climate transition.  It will be a very important programme.<\/p> <p>  Regarding our promotion of it, we are doing a lot to highlight the benefits of smart meters for customers.  At the end of the day, we are effectively a neutral party in the system in installing this infrastructure and maintaining it.  There is the benefit of not having estimated bills for customers which has been a major issue for people.  Over time, we will see development in the market regarding charging EVs at night-time, weekends or whenever it might be.  We are committed to playing our part and promoting the increased use of smart meters over the long term, which is fundamental for the electrification of heat and transport.<\/p> <p>  It is worth summarising briefly the different roles relating to offshore energy generation.  The Government made a decision that the transmission asset owner of the offshore assets is EirGrid.  ESB Networks' role is as the onshore transmission asset owner.  The fundamental issue for us when it comes to offshore energy generation is the scale of the reinforcement work that is needed on the transmission system to enable the achievement of the climate action plan targets.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done on the transmission network in the east coast area where the majority of the first phase of projects will be coming in in the coming years, particularly in the Dublin area.  That is in addition to us developing and investing in the distribution network at the same time.  There is an enormous scale of work.<\/p> <p>  We are working closely with EirGrid on the early stages of the development of the projects for which it is responsible.  ESB Networks has responsibility for the detailed design and procurement, managing the contractors and managing the projects through the delivery phase.  There are many different strands relating to building up key resources, and going out and procuring contracts in the marketplace.  With so much to be delivered across climate action in general, access to resources will be key in growing the amount of delivery that is possible.  That will be the challenge and ESB Networks is up for that challenge.  We know what is ahead of us and we are committed to doing everything we can to play our role in the growth of offshore wind energy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#BB00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Tarrant"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their opening statements.

The cap is 50 kW but it seems there are many businesses, in particular, that would certainly have roof space for solar and a demand for more power.  The scheme, therefore, might not be ideal for them.  Why is the cap 50 kW?<\/p><p>If you want to install more than 50 kW, the bureaucracy is different and there are different safety requirements, all of which add costs which may be prohibitive for people thinking about putting reasonably large systems on their premises.  Is thought being given to increasing the cap beyond 50 kW?  <\/p><p> I believe it was said that there had been an increase from 150 to 650 applications.  I suspect that, given the current climate of high energy costs, this will increase exponentially.  Are there plans to connect many more than that because it is still a very small percentage of prospective premises?  We are talking about a cap of probably 20 MW or 30 MW but we could possibly get new capacity to the order of a few hundred megawatts through a scheme of this size.<\/p><p> There is also the related question of the resources ESB Networks put into processing these applications.  It is one thing to say that so many new connections will be made but, if ESB Networks does not have the resources, it will take a long time.  Given the current surge in interest - I find myself using electrical language such as \"surge\" and \"current\" all of the time - are more resources needed to process applications to the mini-generation scheme to get more people onto the network with their new solar installations?

We built on that in the small-scale generation scheme, which we launched last Friday and which allows for generation of up to 200 kW.  It is the next level up.  People can still apply for greater capacities under what is called the enduring connection policy.  There is still that route but we looked at how to streamline the process to make it as simple and fast as possible.  It still has to be technically acceptable but we sought to minimise impact and allow it to be done as quickly as possible.  The mini-generation scheme I was talking about was a great success.  It was oversubscribed and full within three or four months.  We doubled it and added more capacity.  We are seeing that.  We still have headroom.  It is still being called a pilot scheme but we are working with the regulator to treat it as business as usual and to increase the scheme.  We do not intend to stop it but to keep going forward with it although it was launched as a pilot.  The small-scale generation scheme for generation of up to 200 kW was just launched on Friday and we have already had feedback from stakeholders we did not engage with.

With regard to the mini-generation pilot scheme we launched, there was a lot of upfront engagement with the industry as to the standard of the application form and going back and forth in getting to know it.

We have changed our structures and streamlined our process as well.  We are looking at a very fast process with regard to carrying out the study and letting the customer know.  We have also built in mechanisms for the customers' benefit.  For example, they can choose to tick a box and do a maximum export capacity, MEC, reduction.

In terms of the standard charge, approximately one-third of customers' tariffs are paid through the fixed element, which is called the\u00a0distribution use of system charges, DUoS, and the other two-thirds are fixed.  Consumption will change if someone has microgeneration or with the electrification of heat and transport.  Right now, we are about one-third fixed versus two-thirds variable, which is low by international standards as there is more of a move to fixed in other jurisdiction because the network tariff element of the infrastructure that we provide is a fixed cost predominantly but it is one-third.  Right now, the regulator is running a consultation in the form of a tariff structure review.  The regulator ran a consultation towards the end of last year and is considering that.  There will be more phases to that consultation and then that will decide the optimum solution in terms of the tariff structure so fixed versus variable, etc.  The regulator sets the standing charge.  The regulator as part of its consultation is engaging with lots of stakeholders and we will feed into that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#JJ00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Joe Duignan"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":300,"content":"<p>Will that be reflected in the balance between standing charges and individuals' bills so standing charges versus user chargers?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#JJ00300","speaker":"1549"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":301,"content":"<p>That would be one of CRU's key considerations as part of the tariff structural review to find the optimum structure.

At a time when one has a drive for customers to use more electricity from the point of view of the electrification of heat and transport and maybe a competing one around more energy efficiency and reducing use the whole shape of tariffs might need to be different.  One can expect that there is a potential for changes in the future.  As Mr. Duginan mentioned, there is a tariff review process but with the direction of the industry there could be further changes along the way but that is a matter for CRU.<\/p> <p>  On data centres, for ESB Networks, and it is a similar role for EirGrid but I will just talk about ESB Networks, once we get connection applications we are obliged to connect people to the network whether that is a factory, data centre or an individual house but subject to policy.  We did get a direction from the CRU on the connection of data centres that led to the current situation.  If one looks at the future of supply and demand, and the amount of electricity needed for data centres over the next decade, on which there has been a lot of commentary, there is also huge potential for offshore renewable electricity through offshore wind.  Ireland is in a unique position in Europe because of our island nature and offshore assets but it is a matter for the Government to decide the policy regarding the growth of data centres. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#JJ00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicholas Tarrant"},{"type":"speech","time":1664838000,"counter":303,"content":"<p>I wish to comment on the last point about offshore renewables as I am not sure if I heard Mr. Tarrant correctly and I know that he is not here to talk about the transmission system.

It is a matter for the Government to decide no matter whether it is an industrial policy or a business-related policy for data centres.

Moray East Offshore Wind Farm is incredibly impressive.<\/p> <p>  It seems to me that the system in this country has been very east coast-leaning throughout its history thus leading to a faster growth of the east coast.  We have pushed infrastructure and responded to demand.  Notwithstanding the current plans, and most of the phase 1 offshore projects are on the east coast, there is a greater opportunity in the long run for renewables on the west coast.  Therefore, we must start planning to reinforce our infrastructure on the west coast side of the country and not view that as a prospect in the distant future.  I believe that development will come on pretty quickly and developers will look to the west, particularly with the advent of floating offshore wind technology.  What role can be played by ESB Networks?  I ask because it was mentioned earlier that the Dublin grid needed to be reinforced.  That is true but we need to plan for west coast infrastructure as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CAJ2022100400002#KK00400","speaker":"1594"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1664838000,"counter":308,"content":"<p>EirGrid plans the transmission system across all of the country.

It will depend on which options are chosen around the development of the transmission system.  We are talking about offshore projects but let us consider what happened with onshore projects.  Significant infrastructure was put into onshore wind projects to develop the assets that were growing in the west.  From the south west right up to the west coast there was a huge amount of investment to enable the bringing of that wind on to the system and communities have reaped huge benefits.  The future development of the offshore industry could be on all parts of our offshore area and definitely with the growth of floating as a technology for the future.  Ultimately, the first phase will depend on a continuation of the RESS auctions and then beyond that as the offshore wind industry takes off in this country.
