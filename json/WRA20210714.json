Provisional application is a standard mechanism provided for in the EU&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements.  This means that those areas where the EU has full competence may be applied immediately once the Agreement has been voted for by Council and the European Parliament. It is an important mechanism that allows consumers and companies to benefit from a trade agreement at an early stage, as the completion of national ratification procedures across all 27 Member States can take several years. <\/p>  <p>  The positive impact of the provisional application of the Agreement has been plain to see with goods exports to Canada increased from EUR 953 million in 2016 to more than EUR 1.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 78 per cent, while services exports grew from EUR 1.6 billion in 2016 to more than EUR 2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44 per cent.  <\/p>  <p>  Looking further at the tangible benefits of this Agreement, my Department has recently released the results of an independent study of the potential economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland from the European Union&rsquo;s Free Trade Agreements with Canada as well as South Korea, Mexico and Japan. The study, released on 28th of April, encompasses state of the art quantitative modelling and qualitative analysis, including a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement with business and agriculture representatives and found that these four EU FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income in Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  The full coming into force of the Agreement once ratified across all Member States, will see the implementation of the Investment Chapter of the Agreement including the resolution of disputes between investors and states, should they arise.  All international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  Where such agreements cover (i) trade in both goods and services and (ii) investment rules and protections, then there must be a dispute resolution mechanism that covers investments.  The EU&rsquo;s new approach to investment protection is the Investment Court System (ICS) which is contained in CETA and replaces the old Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism.  I have set out for the House, on many occasions previously, the improvements ICS represents over the older ISDS. <\/p>  <p>  It is also important to point out that CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada&rsquo;s right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection. And while CETA does not prevent a party pursuing a claim through domestic courts, the ICS element of CETA is specifically designed to provide an arbitration alternative to either EU investors in Canada or Canadian investors in the EU. <\/p>  <p>  As I outlined during my  appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on EU Affairs on 26 May 2021,  ratifying CETA is Government policy and an objective of mine as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefited immensely from our export-orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this. Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) for many decades and participating in EU third country agreements that cover investment and provide investment protection continue to assist us in marketing Ireland as a competitive, FDI-friendly, jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to invest in with the attendant jobs and prosperity that entails. <\/p>  <p>  Taking the foregoing into consideration and given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a progressive, high-standard agreement, I believe that ratifying the agreement would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade. <\/p>  <p>  Finally, for CETA to enter into force fully and definitively all EU Member States need to ratify the Agreement in line with their national procedures and this process is still ongoing so I cannot say when CETA will take full effect.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400102#WRB03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1474"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Grant Payments","counter":55,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400102#WRB03200"},{"type":"question","counter":56,"qnumday":34,"qnumall":"[38641\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400102#WRB03300","dept":"Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment","minister":"Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment","question":"the number of applications that have been received by Cavan County Council for the restart fund for micro and small businesses; the amount of funding that has been allocated to the local authority; the number of businesses in County Cavan that have received funding under the fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1474"},{"type":"speech","counter":57,"content":"<p>The Restart Grant and Restart Grant Plus schemes were administered by the 31 Local Authorities on behalf of my Department and closed to applications on 31st October 2020.

Further details are available through the NBI website which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register their interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website www.nbi.ie. Libraries may register with this facility to receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates related to their own premises as works commence.

The scheme ended on 30 April.  <\/p>  <p>  Since 1 October 2020, a total of 66,900 receipts have been uploaded to the Revenue Receipts Tracker, as at 8 July 2021. The related expenditure recorded on these receipts amounts to &euro;11,073,537, and the potential tax cost is &euro;2,214,707, assuming all such expenditure is claimed and qualifies in full for tax relief. Subsequent to claims being made in respect of this scheme and any other relief or deduction, verification of such reliefs and deductions forms part of Revenue&rsquo;s comprehensive risk assessment programme. <\/p>  <p>  The scheme was developed at a time last year when there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that the re-opening of the economy could be sustained uninterrupted. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and, with the exception of some short periods, public health restrictions had the effect of impeding the operation of the incentive as originally envisaged.   <\/p>  <p>  While I am very mindful of the significant difficulties that remain to be faced by the hospitality sector, I made the determination that the broad interests of taxpayers would not have been best served by extending the scheme over the summer months in circumstances where most will be staying at home and hopefully holidaying in Ireland. This is particularly the case when other very significant support measures will remain in place.  <\/p>  <p>  Currently, I do not have plans to re-introduce the Stay and Spend scheme or other similar tax-based measures.  However, it may be useful to highlight and summarise the significant supports that remain available to support businesses in the hospitality sector:<\/p>  <p>  - In recognition of the unprecedented challenges facing the Hospitality and Tourism sector, the VAT rate was reduced from 13.5% to 9% from 1 November 2020.  This is a temporary but important measure to provide support to the sector, where many businesses remain closed for now and those that are open are operating at significantly reduced capacity. It was originally to apply until 31 December 2021. However, the reduced rate will be extended to 1 September 2022. The extension until the end of the 2022 summer season allows for a longer period of recovery for the sector.  It should be noted that this VAT rate reduction came after the introduction of the Stay and Spend Tax Credit and reflects the fact that the latter was not intended to be the sole sector-specific support for hospitality. <\/p>  <p>  - In addition, the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme (EWSS) continues to be a key component of the Government&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 crisis to support viable firms and encourage employment in the hospitality and tourism sector and beyond. <\/p>  <p>  - The Covid Restrictions Support Scheme (CRSS) is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by restrictions introduced by the Government under public health regulations to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is available to companies, self-employed individuals and partnerships who carry on a trade or trading activities, the profits from which are chargeable to tax under Case I of Schedule D, from a business premises located in a region subject to restrictions introduced in line with the Living with COVID-19 Plan.<\/p>  <p>  - The extension of the tax debt warehousing scheme to allow the period where liabilities arising can be &ldquo;warehoused&rdquo; to be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022, and to include overpayments of EWSS in the scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tax Yield","counter":217,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD04400"},{"type":"question","counter":218,"qnumday":88,"qnumall":"[38389\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD04500","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the estimated additional income the State would receive if corporation tax was increased to 15%; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1568","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":219,"content":"<p>On a straightforward, mathematical basis there is a large theoretical yield from increasing the corporation tax rate for trading income. However, the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) reports that research from both the United States and Europe suggests that foreign direct investment (FDI) and the decisions of multinationals to locate in Ireland are highly sensitive to rates of corporation tax. Therefore, increasing the corporation tax rate would likely lead to lower levels of economic activity, behavioural changes in the locational decisions of multinational companies and employment in the multinational sector. As a result of the difficulty of predicting and quantifying these impacts, particularly in the current economic climate, it is not possible to accurately or robustly estimate the potential yield from the increases proposed by the Deputy. I would note however that ESRI research in 2011 estimated that reducing Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax rate from 40% in 1994 to 12.5% in 2003 added almost 4% to the level of economic output in 2005 and around &euro;2 billion in corporation tax revenues. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, while corporation tax is statutorily levied on the profits of businesses, the ESRI states that researchers have concluded that a large share of the burden is likely to be borne by workers in the form of lower wages. This can arise from companies deciding to invest less, leading to lower capital and lower labour productivity and wages. As the ESRI found that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) predominantly finance their investments in fixed assets, intangible assets and staff through internal funds, raising the rate of corporation tax would hamper their ability to invest and grow. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":220,"content":"<p>Question No. 89 answered with Question No. 82.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":222,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[38452\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD04900","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the amount of funding raised to date through the application of the carbon tax on green diesel used by agricultural contractors; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1451","askee":"1558"},{"type":"speech","counter":223,"content":"<p>The Carbon Tax receipts in respect of Marked Gas Oil (green diesel) for each of the years since its introduction in 2010 up to 2019 are published on the Revenue website at the following link:  <\/p><p>www.revenue.ie\/en\/corporate\/information-about-revenue\/statistics\/excise\/receipts-volume-and-price\/excise-receipts-commodity.aspx.

The Central Bank also provides ICT facilities and services to another body under the aegis of my Department, the Investor Compensation Company DAC.<\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is committed to ensuring its information is available in accessible formats that are easy to understand. Accessibility of its services forms a key commitment within its 3-year Strategic Plan. The FSPO has committed to developing a new website in 2021 which will be in full compliance with the Web Accessibility Directive to ensure the promotion of accessibility and Universal Design principles in the rollout of its IT strategy. The new website will include an Accessibility Statement, confirming the FSPO&rsquo;s compliance with the regulations under the Directive, as well as details of a mechanism through which users can provide feedback on the accessibility of the FSPO&rsquo;s digital services. <\/p>  <p>  Further to Action 16 of the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, in ensuring its information is available in accessible formats that are easy to understand, Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI) promotes accessibility and universal design principles in the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy 2015 where applicable. HBFI is committed to making information accessible to all and further details on its accessibility are outlined under &lsquo;Legal&rsquo; on its website. <\/p>  <p>  While the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) is in the very advanced stages of wind down with no employees, the Special Liquidators have always been conscious to observe the principles of inclusion and to provide any public sector information, such as IBRC's Annual Progress Report, in an accessible, easy to understand format. <\/p>  <p>  The Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal (IFSAT) has published a National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA) approved guideline to the IFSAT Rules and is currently carrying out revisions to its website to ensure that it is in an accessible format.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recognises the importance of ensuring that its ICT infrastructure, in particular its website, is accessible. It ensures that its videos are subtitled, that images have alt text (a short written description of an image, which makes sense of that image when it can't be viewed) and that content on the website is machine readable so that it is compatible with immersive readers. It is committed to ensuring that its website continues to meet the basic four POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust).<\/p>  <p>  The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) is committed to making the information publicly available on its website accessible to all. NAMA&rsquo;s accessibility statement is available on its website.<\/p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) ensures that its public sector information is available in accessible formats that are easy to understand, promote accessibility and use universal design principles in the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy 2015 where applicable to the NTMA. The NTMA is committed to making information accessible to all and this is further outlined on the NTMA website under &lsquo;Accessibility&rsquo;.<\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General has promoted accessibility and universal design principles in the implementation of the Public Service ICT Strategy Office by improving accessibility of the Office&rsquo;s website through installation of software called Recite Me. This accessibility software facilitates a wide variety of people to access the website content in a way that takes account of individual requirements and abilities. This software provides text to speech functionality, fully customisable styling features, reading support aids and a translation tool with over 100 languages, including 35 text to speech voices and many other features. In order to optimise its accessibility, the Office has recently commissioned an accessibility scan and assessment of its website. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is committed to making its services fully accessible to all individuals.

It has a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group which provides an opportunity for members to inform and contribute to the Bank&rsquo;s overall Disability and Inclusion agenda, and has an internal Disability Taskforce in place that is responsible for coordinating and overseeing compliance with disability legislation. The Bank engages with external organisations to support the employment of persons with disabilities. It continues to engage with the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability (AHEAD) on the facilitation of Willing Able Mentoring (WAM) work placements, ring-fencing roles on its graduate programmes for those who apply via WAM. The Bank participates in various events and workshops including AHEAD&rsquo;s annual careers event for students and graduates with disabilities.  <\/p>  <p>  The Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO) is committed to the priorities set out in the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021. The accessibility of its services for people with disabilities and the consideration of wider human rights and equality issues related to the FSPO&rsquo;s functions form a key commitment of its 3-year Strategic Plan. In particular, the FSPO has committed to reviewing its key projects over the lifetime of the Strategic Plan through a human rights and equality lens which will involve disability-proofing its services and may include consultation, as appropriate. Recently, the FSPO conducted an open public consultation process to inform the development of its Strategic Plan. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is fully committed to providing excellent service to all individuals. As part of that commitment, Revenue provides a network of trained Access Officers who are available to assist customers with disabilities. To ensure the quality of this service is maintained to the highest standards, Access Officers receive ongoing training in disability awareness and equality, guided by material published by the National Disability Authority and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. Revenue also works with Sign Language Interpreting Service (SLIS), the national sign language interpreting service for Ireland, to provide a free Irish sign language interpreting service to customers with hearing disabilities. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD05600","answer":true,"speaker":"1558"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","counter":231,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD05800"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"National Broadband Plan","counter":230,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD05700"},{"type":"question","counter":231,"qnumday":93,"qnumall":"[38207\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400104#WRD05800","dept":"Department of Public Expenditure and Reform","minister":"Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform","question":"the engagement he or the agencies under his remit has had with the National Broadband Plan in the past two months.","asker":"1514","askee":"1459"},{"type":"speech","counter":232,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that neither<b><\/b>I nor any officials from my Department have met with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communication&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan (NBP) project team or National Broadband Ireland within the specified period.

This commitment is demonstrated in the Civil Service 2030 Renewal Strategy that was launched in May 2021. <\/p><p>The Public Appointments Services (PAS) is the principal recruiter for the Civil Service.

The goal is to provide trainees with the skills, knowledge and ability to gain meaningful employment via the unique opportunity to gain practical work experience, as well as accredited learning over an 11 month period.  Over a quarter of the initial OWL interns have since gone on to secure permanent civil service employment through confined competitions.  <\/p><p>My Department also works closely with the National Disability Authority, as well as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, on the Equality Budgeting Expert Advisory Group established to further guide the ongoing rollout of Equality Budgeting.  Equality Budgeting has developed over recent years with a view to enhancing the role of resource allocation policies in advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  Equality Budgeting was expanded in 2019 to further develop the gender budgeting elements and to broaden its scope to other dimensions of equality including poverty, socioeconomic inequality and disability. <\/p><p>In terms of Equality, Diversity and Inclusion within my own Department, the HR Unit developed a HR Strategy that has a focus on embracing and embedding a culture of diversity and inclusion across the Department through diversity initiatives and training.  This has included the establishment of a vibrant cross-Divisional and cross-grade Diversity and Inclusion staff forum, the PERspectives Group.  My Department has a Disability Liaison Officer (DLO) who supports new members of staff with a disability or existing staff who acquire a disability and raise awareness about disability.

As there is a specific set of skills and competencies required to do this, and in preparation for future active engagement consultation processes, OPW need to upskill OPW staff in-house and provide training in Active Engagement. This is essential if the OPW is to take this on in another programme which requires participation in active engagement. An additional requirement is the appointment of experts to guide OPW through the required processes.

Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector&rsquo;s survival and recovery. <\/p>  <p>  A Tourism Recovery Taskforce was appointed last year to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan with recommendations on how best the Irish Tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The taskforce presented its Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023 to me on 30th September last. The Plan made a number of recommendations to help tourism businesses to survive, stabilise and recover from the COVID pandemic. It has been a very useful input for me and my colleagues in Government in considering measures to assist the sector and will remain so as we move from survival to recovery.<\/p>  <p>  As recommended in the Tourism Recovery Plan, I appointed a Recovery Oversight Group in December 2020. The group has met eight times to date, most recently on June 30th. It has reported to me twice with regard to the implementation of the Plan and the recovery of the sector. These reports have further informed my thinking, and that of my colleagues in Government, with regard to ongoing measures to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  I secured &euro;55m in Budget 2021 for F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, three stages of which have now closed for applications.  The aim of the Scheme is to assist certain tourism services survive the pandemic and drive recovery.  The Scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses, which are not eligible for CRSS, to support their survival.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme, my Department funded F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s delivery of the &euro;10m Coach Tourism Operators Business Continuity Scheme and the &euro;10m Ireland Based Inbound Agents Continuity Scheme in the final quarter of 2020.  <\/p>  <p>  During the same period, a total of &euro;26m was provided for F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s Covid-19 Adaptation Fund and the tourism agency also administered the &euro;8m Restart Grant Plus for B&amp;Bs, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp;amp; Employment.  Funding of &euro;5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence for tourism businesses.   The tourism and hospitality sector has also benefited from the VAT reduction to 9%, which will now extend to September 2022.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism businesses have also been supported by horizontal supports and measures such as the CRSS, PUP, EWSS, tax warehousing and the commercial rates waiver, some of which have been enhanced or extended under the recent Economic Recovery Plan.<\/p>  <p>  My Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland continue to monitor and evaluate the business continuity requirements of the tourism sector and I will be announcing further funding calls under the Tourism Business Continuity Scheme in due course.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy will already be aware that Great Britain has always been one of our most important tourism market, in terms of visitor numbers. Before COVID-19, in 2019, revenue from British visitors was worth over &euro;1 billion to our economy. Unfortunately, the necessary public health measures introduced to control the pandemic have meant that inbound tourism has been decimated and the British market is no different in this respect. Due to the devastating impact of Covid-19, the impact of Brexit on our tourism sector may not become apparent for some time. <\/p>  <p>  Getting inbound international tourism back up and running is vital for the recovery of the sector and the continued economic well-being of this country.  Tourism cannot begin to fully recover until we can find a way to safely resume inbound tourism as it accounts for about 75% of the revenue generated by the sector.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of Digital COVID Certificates by 19 July provides much need clarity to our tourism and hospitality sectors as regards a roadmap for the resumption of international travel.  Alignment with the EU&rsquo;s Digital COVID Certificate regulation will facilitate a gradual and safe resumption of inbound tourism, as well as allowing Tourism Ireland to take appropriate steps to market Ireland in overseas markets.<\/p>  <p>  Tourism Ireland has been actively planning for the restart of international travel and is rolling out a significant promotional kick-start campaign to entice and welcome back overseas visitors. Phase one involved a major digital video campaign, which went live in Great Britain in June. I am aware also that the agency has significant additional activity planned for the second half of this year to stimulate British tourists to return to Ireland and will work with the industry to facilitate this.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400106#WRF05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1471"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Sports Events","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400106#WRF05800"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":119,"qnumall":"[31593\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400106#WRF05900","dept":"Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","minister":"Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht","question":"if she will address a matter regarding regattas (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1487","askee":"1471"},{"type":"speech","counter":311,"content":"<p>Under the current public health regulations, the numbers permitted to attend outdoor organised events such as regattas stands at a maximum of 200 with appropriate protective measures in place such as adherence to social distancing requirements. <\/p><p>It would be appropriate and beneficial for the event organisers concerned to consult the guidelines prepared by a combined working group of the FAI, the IRFU, the GAA and Sport Ireland.

The grants include the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People, which are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The detailed administration of these grant schemes, including assessment, approval and prioritisation, is the responsibility of local authorities. The grants fund on an annual basis approximately 10,000 home improvement and adaptation works and are hugely effective in meeting the accommodation needs of older persons and persons with a disability right across the country. <\/p>  <p>  My Department's approach each year is to issue a single full year allocation to each local authority, so they can effectively plan and implement the grants programme. Over the course of the year, my Department works closely with the local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of the available funding. This means that if underspends arise on the part of some local authorities, they can be redistributed to other authorities which have high levels of grant activity. <\/p>  <p>  Over the course of this year, Monaghan County Council have made two separate requests for additional Exchequer funding, totalling &euro;571,020. These requests have been approved by my Department, bringing the Council's combined allocation for 2021 to &euro;2 million, of which &euro;400,000 is being provided from the Council's own resources. If Monaghan County Council is in a position to allocate additional own resources to the grant scheme in 2021 further additional funding can be requested from my Department and ever effort will be made to accede to any such request.<\/p>  <p>  Separately, grant aid may be considered for the provision of infrastructural and safety related adaptations to create appropriate space for applicants with specific sensory needs. Applications of this nature should be supported by a multidisciplinary assessment of the applicant by specialist healthcare professionals. This should outline who will be responsible for therapy services and\/or the provision and upkeep of sensory related equipment as the grant schemes do not fund the provision of such equipment. <\/p>  <p>  Funding of &euro;75 million is available nationally in 2021 for the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability Scheme. This funding has increased year on year since 2014.  As part of the annual budgetary process, consideration will be given to increasing this funding in future years in line with the Programme for Government commitments and the Policy Statement on Housing Options for Our Ageing Population, which is available on my Department's website at the following link: <\/p>  <p>  www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/ea33c1-housing-options-for-our-ageing-population-policy-statement\/<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03300","answer":true,"speaker":"1561"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Land Issues","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03400"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":135,"qnumall":"[38396\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03500","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"if his attention has been drawn to a number of instances across north County Donegal in which landowners have come into conflict with their neighbouring landowners arising from discrepancies between their original folio Land Registry maps and the maps that have emerged from the digitisation of the mapping system by the Property Registration Authority of Ireland; if he will request that an independent review of these discrepancies will be carried out; and the reason that such discrepancies occurred. ","asker":"1463","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>I am informed that the digitisation of the Property Registration Authority (PRA) map record took place between December 2005 and August 2010.  During this period, approximately 2.5 million registered land parcels, comprising approximately 15 million line entities, were digitised from 36,000 PRA paper map sheets. <\/p>  <p>  Having completed the digitisation of the PRA map record, a comprehensive assessment of the quality of the data capture was carried out.  This study revealed an error rate of 0.18 per cent.  It should be noted that the digital mapping project was much more than just a matter of transferring the registered land parcels from a paper map record to a digital map record.  Listed below are some of the factors that contributed to the complexity of the challenges associated with the project:<\/p>  <p>  - Moving all registrations from the now defunct County Series and Irish Grid map projections to the latest Irish Transverse Mercator map projection;<\/p>  <p>  - Development schemes mapped on the PRA paper-based record were found to be at variance with the more accurate &ldquo;As Built&rdquo; layout presented by Ordnance Survey Ireland;<\/p>  <p>  - Transferring registrations from Western seaboard counties which, up until the digital mapping project predominantly mapped on 1\/10560 or 6&rdquo; Ordnance Survey mapping, had not benefited from any revisions for decades;<\/p>  <p>  - Deciphering map data on old PRA paper maps, some of which were 100 years old; and<\/p>  <p>  - Deciphering map data on badly damaged PRA paper maps.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that prior to the data capture element of the project, the process was validated by eminent international mapping\/land administration experts.<\/p>  <p>  I am further informed that the PRA has in place robust structures whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration.  The PRA also has a longstanding and valued relationship with solicitors, surveyors, engineers and architects in all matters pertaining to property registration.<\/p>  <p>  The PRA&rsquo;s experience has been such that many of the queries received, once investigated, do not indicate any registration error.  Many of the perceived errors do not emanate from the PRA but, in fact, can originate from inaccuracies in the application map lodged for registration.  It should be noted that the responsibility for the accuracy of the application map lodged rests with the applicant.<\/p>  <p>  There also needs to be due recognition given to the fact that the PRA digital mapping project resolved many thousands of pre-existing issues and anomalies that existed in the paper-based map system.  Being pro-active in the adoption of Ordnance Survey topographical detail, during digitisation, has absolved many property owners of the need to incur costs in an effort to perfect or amend the Land Register to reflect the actual position on the ground.<\/p>  <p>  As referred to previously, the PRA has in place a robust structure whereby the registered owners of properties or their representatives can engage with the PRA in relation to matters pertaining to the mapped representation of the registration(s).  Registrations that are queried require a considerable amount of effort to investigate.  There is a requirement to retrieve the original registration documents and maps in order to facilitate a thorough analysis and examination.  On some occasions, there is a necessity to revert to and consult with Irish Land Commission maps and documentation in order to draw a conclusion.  Statistics show that approximately 50 per cent of the cases reviewed by the PRA result in no change to the registration, yet they are very time consuming to investigate.  Of course, the PRA makes every effort to review each case in as timely a manner as possible.<\/p>  <p>  Having regard to the foregoing, I have no plans to conduct or commission an independent review of alleged discrepancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Local Authorities","counter":359,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03700"},{"type":"question","counter":360,"qnumday":136,"qnumall":"[38401\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400107#WRG03800","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, and Local Government","question":"the number of land purchases by local authorities that have been approved by his Department in 2019, 2020 and to date in 2021; if he will provide a list of these purchases including location and hectarage; and the financing provided to each local authority for each land purchase.","asker":"1468","askee":"1561"},{"type":"speech","counter":361,"content":"<p>All local authorities acquire land on an ongoing basis for a wide range of uses, including housing developments.

The proposed new arrangements will effectively restore decision-making on such large scale developments to local authorities in the first instance.<\/p>  <p>  The proposed new LSRD arrangements will comprise 3 pillars: pre-application consultation stage, planning application stage and appeal stage, summarised as follows<\/p>  <p>  - planning authorities will be required to complete the &ldquo;final consultation meeting&rdquo; element of the pre-application consultation stage, involving a bilateral  meeting between the planning authority and the developer, within 8 weeks of the receipt of a request for such meeting;<\/p>  <p>  - subsequent LSRD planning applications will be generally required to be determined by planning authorities within 8 weeks of receipt of an application;<\/p>  <p>  - the determination of appeals against planning decisions by planning authorities will be generally required to be determined by An Bord Pleanala within 16 weeks of receipt of an appeal.<\/p>  <p>  The application of these new arrangements is intended to streamline the decision making process for  LSRDs, thereby providing greater certainty and clarity to developers regarding the timelines for decisions in respect of such development proposals. <\/p>  <p>  The General Scheme also proposes a number of transitional arrangements in relation to the expiry of the SHD arrangements and their replacement by the new LSRD arrangements, most of which are contingent on the early enactment of the Bill. Under the proposals:<\/p>  <p>  - a planning application for a SHD must be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la (the Board) by 31 December 2021 at the latest, for proposals which have completed the SHD pre-application consultation process with the Board on or before 29 October 2021;<\/p>  <p>  - 29 October 2021 will be the last day for requesting a SHD pre-application consultation request with the Board, with 25 February 2022 being the last date for submitting a subsequent SHD planning application to the Board in respect of those SHD proposals which complete the SHD pre-application consultation process after 29 October 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Further details in relation to the proposals are set out in the General Scheme which is available on at: www.gov.ie\/en\/publication\/a10f2-general-scheme-of-planning-and-development-amendment-lsrd-bill-2021\/.<\/p>  <p>  It is intended that the Bill will be enacted as soon as possible in the autumn with the new LSRD arrangements commencing on enactment of the Bill. The LSRD and SHD schemes will both operate concurrently for a limited period of time with developers being able to choose which process to engage with during this interim period. Once the final SHD planning applications have worked their way through the system, the LSRD arrangements will be the sole planning consent system for applications of this scale.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1595"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":407,"content":"<p>Question No. 152 answered with Question No. 151.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","counter":409,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH01400"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Northern Ireland","counter":408,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH01300"},{"type":"question","counter":409,"qnumday":153,"qnumall":"[38227\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the extent of the engagements that he has had with a person (details supplied) and the families of the Omagh bomb victims; the steps he has taken to commence a full cross-Border public enquiry into the Omagh bombing; and if he will engage with the victims&rsquo; families as the 23rd anniversary of the tragedy approaches in August.","asker":"1612","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":410,"content":"<p>The bombing at Omagh on 15 August 1998, 23 years ago next month, is among the most appalling acts of terrorist violence committed during the conflict in Northern Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  It was a cowardly attack on innocent people enjoying a sunny afternoon in Omagh town centre.

They underscored the importance of continued dialogue to ensure that the hard won peace on this island is maintained. <\/p>  <p>  There are democratic and legal means available to address everyone&rsquo;s concerns, be they in relation to the outworking of Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol, or other issues.

I have continued to engage regularly on these issues with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and with the Northern Ireland parties.<\/p>  <p>  I was pleased to co-chair the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC) last month. The BIIGC is an important institution of the Good Friday Agreement, and it was positive both that it met for the first time since 2019, and that we agreed that it would be convened again in November.<\/p>  <p>  Alongside East-West relations, economic and security cooperation and other shared ambitions, we were able to discuss how we can, together, best support the stability of all institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. There were also important discussions around the need to make progress on addressing the legacy of the past, and we announced the beginning of an intensive period of engagement on the issue with the Northern Ireland parties, and victims at its heart.<\/p>  <p>  We look forward to continued engagement with counterparts from the Northern Ireland Executive through the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC).<\/p>  <p>  The NSMC is essential to oversee and develop North South cooperation on matters of mutual interest. Two successful NSMC plenary meetings have now taken place, as well as a number of Sectoral meetings at Ministerial level, and progress continues across the breadth of North-South areas of cooperation.  It is regrettable that it was necessary to postpone the plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council scheduled for 18 June, but planning is underway for this to take place in the weeks ahead.<\/p>  <p>  The Irish Government is continuing to progress the commitments that were made at the time of the New Decade New Approach Agreement, which are focused on working with the Executive to deliver projects that benefit people across the island, including greater connectivity between North and South; investing in the North West region and in border communities; supporting the Irish language in Northern Ireland; and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the Peace Process. The first implementation review meeting took place in January of this year, which I attended with representatives of the British Government and the Executive. We reaffirmed our shared commitment to the Peace Process. <\/p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department&rsquo;s Reconciliation Fund plays a key part in demonstrating in a very practical and tangible way the Government&rsquo;s commitment to peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.  The Reconciliation Fund awards grants to 150-200 projects each year, supporting projects across the community, voluntary, and higher education sectors. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of grants are awarded to groups working within Northern Ireland. These projects build meaningful links across communities, addressing the issues that are impacting on their lives, including sectarianism, and are working to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH05700","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"question","counter":454,"qnumday":168,"qnumall":"[38618\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400108#WRH05900","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if there have been discussions with the British authorities since the recent decision of the Northern Ireland Public Prosecution Service to discontinue the prosecution of a soldier in relation to murders in Derry on Bloody Sunday in 1972 in view of the widespread concerns on these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":455,"content":"<p>I am aware of the decision taken by the Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland not to proceed with the prosecution of 'Soldier F' in relation to charges of murder and attempted murder in Derry on Bloody Sunday, as well as the decision not to prosecute 'Soldier B' in connection with the fatal shooting of Daniel Hegarty also in Derry in 1972. <\/p>  <p>  I know that this is deeply upsetting for all the families involved who have spent so many years in pursuit of justice for their loved ones and our thoughts are with all of them.

The current Irish Exclusive Economic Zone, (EEZ) or Exclusive Fishery Limits, (EFL) extends to 200 miles offshore and covers an area of 132,000 nautical square miles which is equivalent to an area of 175,000 square land miles. This represents 16% of EU waters. Questions related to the specific rights and responsibilities associated with Ireland's EEZ should be directed to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. <\/p>  <p>  From a Defence Organisation perspective, the Naval Service and the Air Corps currently patrol the entire 200 mile limit in respect of sea fisheries protection and periodically patrol beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary including coastal areas. Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in that they undertake general surveillance security and other duties while conducting their primary day-to-day tasking of providing a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery and drug interdiction operations.<\/p>  <p>  Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our EEZ using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.<\/p>  <p>  In a military context, under international law other State's naval ships or vessels are within their rights to carry out a training exercise in Ireland's EEZ or to traverse the Irish EEZ. This is not in any way an infringement of our national territory. In this context it is not unusual for naval ships or vessels of other States to carry out training exercises within Ireland's EEZ or to passage through this area. This would normally involve prior notification to Irish Authorities where an exercise was taking place close to our Territorial Waters but this is not a requirement. Should another State's naval ship or vessels seek to enter inside Ireland's Territorial Waters, inside the 12NM, then diplomatic clearance must be requested via the Department of Foreign Affairs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400109#WRJ04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1457"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":520,"content":"<p>Question No. 190 answered with Question No. 188.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Air Corps","counter":521,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400109#WRJ05100"},{"type":"question","counter":522,"qnumday":191,"qnumall":"[38715\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400109#WRJ05200","dept":"Department of Defence","minister":"Taoiseach and Minister for Defence","question":"the belligerent incursions in Irish airspace since 2000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1560","askee":"1457"},{"type":"speech","counter":523,"content":"<p>For the Deputy's awareness, in accordance with the legislative requirements of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, all foreign military aircraft wishing to overfly or land in the State require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

This was acknowledged in the Comprehensive Review of the Special Needs Assistant Scheme (SNAs) published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in 2018. <\/p>  <p>  The Review made a number of recommendations regarding SNAs and the need for a more broadly based set of supports including therapeutic supports for pupils with complex needs.   The Review also referenced the training needs of SNAs.  In this regard, the NCSE recommended that a new national training programme at Level 5 of the National Qualification Framework be developed for existing SNAs who do not have the requisite level of training and for new SNAs on appointment.  The NCSE also recommended that training tailored to the specific complex needs of some students being cared for by SNAs would also be provided.  <\/p>  <p>  The policy advice has been considered by the Department. It was decided that priority should be given to the development of a training programme for SNAs who may not have had a recent opportunity to access a training programme tailored to their role.  <\/p>  <p>  A public procurement competition was held for the development and delivery of a new national training programme for SNAs. A detailed specification of need and learning outcomes was developed and published for the competition. Formal accreditation to the National Qualifications Framework was not a requirement for the programme. Following evaluation of the tenders received, the contract was awarded to University College Dublin (UCD) School of Education, in conjunction with UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems.  <\/p>  <p>  UCD has a strong reputation in the world of education and training.  It brings with it a wealth of experience and research knowledge in the training and has very strong quality assurance arrangements for its programmes.  Feedback from programme participants is a key feature of this quality assurance process.  <\/p>  <p>  This new programme aims to enhance the knowledge, skills and expertise of SNAs whose work is central to the inclusion of students with additional care and complex needs in school life.  <\/p>  <p>  The programme consists of five modules, delivered online over a 10-month period. Flexibility is a key part of the approach to the delivery of the programme and participation is voluntary. <\/p>  <p>  The programme is fully funded by the Department and delivered at no cost to the SNA.<\/p>  <p>  Completion of the programme may serve as a stepping stone to further education opportunities in the area. <\/p>  <p>  Each participant who completes the programme successfully will receive a certificate from UCD School of Education which may be of assistance in pursuing further education.  <\/p>  <p>  &euro;2.45m will be allocated to this programme over the next 4 year period based on a full uptake of 3,500 SNAs. The first cohort of 500 SNAs enrolled in January and this phase was oversubscribed.  <\/p>  <p>  This is the first national training programme for SNAs employed in our schools and is tailored to their needs.  The programme will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the approach to the training of SNAs in the future. There is no cost to serving SNAs working in schools. This course is fully funded by the Department of Education. <\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that a more strategic approach is required for the training of SNAs.  This would deal with a number of matters including the identification of need and the provision of appropriate training programmes.

Each of these schools has access to NEPS for Critical Incident Support, the NEPS Regional Support and Development Service and for response to queries arising.  Eight of the schools have an assigned NEPS psychologist for a casework service and two, while awaiting the appointment of a NEPS psychologist, have access to the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  <\/p>  <p>  NEPS psychologists are assigned schools based on a weighting process which takes into account school size, DEIS status, gender mix and geographical spread and equating roughly to a 5,000:1 pupil to psychologist ratio.  <\/p>  <p>  NEPS is a school-based psychological service and NEPS psychologists work collaboratively with teachers in their assigned schools using a consultative problem-solving and solution-oriented approach to maximize positive outcomes for students in the school setting.  In general NEPS psychologists do not work directly in schools outside of term time.  Psychologists, however, continue to work on a casework service, off-site, with a particular focus on report-writing at this time. NEPS continues to be available to support schools should they be needed, throughout the school holiday period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400109#WRJ07400","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"question","counter":547,"qnumday":199,"qnumall":"[38234\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK00300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of NEPS referrals made in the 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 school years for an area (details supplied); and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1507","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":548,"content":"<p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service provides educational psychological support to all primary and post-primary schools.

Health literacy is the capacity of individuals to obtain discerningly, interpret and understand health information; this includes the confidence to access health services and the competence to use such information and services in ways that enhance health. Once students&rsquo; health literacy skills are developed, they will be able to seek out relevant knowledge and information using a variety of sources including digital sources.<\/p>  <p>  Additionally, the Department of Health has produced a Breastfeeding Information Pack for Junior Cycle students in Irish Secondary Schools.<\/p>  <p>  The Information Pack was commissioned jointly by the Department of Health and the HSE Population Health Directorate, and developed by researchers from Health Promotion, Training &amp;amp; Support Services and Elm Training under the direction of a multidisciplinary, multisectoral expert advisory committee with representation from the relevant statutory and voluntary health services, SPHE coordinators and teachers from the relevant education sectors. The views and opinions of Junior Cycle students from a diversity of urban and rural schools were also pivotal in the development of the Information Pack.<\/p>  <p>  The rationale for the initiative is contained in Action 42 of &lsquo;Breastfeeding in Ireland: A Five Year Strategic Action Plan&rsquo; (Department of Health and Children, Oct. 2005), which recommended introducing breastfeeding information and promotion to schoolchildren at all levels of education within the context of the SPHE curriculum.<\/p>  <p>  In general, my Department does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any educational textbook. The current policy within my Department is not to endorse any particular product or publication, including textbooks. There are a small number of exceptions where my Department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need &ndash; for example with Leaving certificate Japanese and Italian. However, as with all textbooks there is no obligation for a school to use these in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level. <\/p>  <p>  The majority of textbooks are commissioned and published by educational publishers, and schools select their books from those available from a number of publishers. The Irish Educational Publishers Association (IEPA) meets with the NCCA in order to discuss the curriculum and to be made aware of any requirements in the curriculum. However the content of any individual textbook is determined by the publisher themselves, and therefore any queries regarding specific content in any particular textbook should be directed to the publisher.<\/p>  <p>  The role of the school is to provide an appropriate education for all its pupils.  A stable, secure learning environment is an essential requirement to achieve this goal.  Schools have autonomy in choosing the resources and programmes that best support the work within their own classrooms<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK03100","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Strategies","counter":576,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK03200"},{"type":"question","counter":577,"qnumday":209,"qnumall":"[38477\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK03300","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the way her Department and public bodies and agencies under her remit are implementing Action 16 of the National Disability and Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021 (details supplied).","asker":"1525","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":578,"content":"<p>My department is committed to making the information on its website accessible to all, regardless of ability.

Overall, primary enrolments are projected to have peaked in 2018 and are currently on a downward trend.  Post-primary enrolments are projected to peak in 2024.<\/p>  <p>  However, school place demand at a more local level can be at variance from national trends.  Therefore, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.   <\/p>  <p>  Recent analysis undertaken by my Department projects that some 79% of the 314 school planning areas have stable or decreasing projected enrolments at primary level for the period to 2025, whereas some 88% of the school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments at post-primary level for the period to 2028.<\/p>  <p>  The level of demand volume across school planning areas with an increasing net requirement ranges from small to medium increases that are likely to be accommodated by existing schools through to significant projected growth that may require additional provision.  <\/p>  <p>  Where data indicates that additional provision is required at primary or post primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following:<\/p>  <p>  - Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Extending the capacity of a school or schools,<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of a new school or schools. <\/p>  <p>  Under Project Ireland 2040, the National Development Plan 2018-2027 provides a capital envelope of &euro;8.4m to facilitate strong rollout of projects under the Schools Building Programme. <\/p>  <p>  My Department has a large pipeline of projects for delivery under the school building programme to cater for current and future educational demands. The pipeline of projects is kept under continual review to ensure alignment with Project Ireland 2040 objectives and the funding provided under the National Development Plan during the period 2018 to 2027 for the schools sector is key enabler for their successful delivery. <\/p>  <p>  During the NDP period 2018 to 2020, 526 school building projects were completed under the Large Scale Capital Programme (LSCP) and the Additional School Accommodation Scheme (ASA).

The Government supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.  The total year one cost of equalising the pay of new entrant teachers to the pre-2011 arrangements is estimated to be in the region of &euro;59 million per annum in year one (&euro;45 million for full resolution of pay scales and &euro;14 million for re-instatement of the H.Dip allowance).  The costs would rise in subsequent years as more new entrants join the system.  <\/p><p>In recent years, National Pay Agreements have seen improvements in relation to teacher pay. In September 2018, an agreement was reached between the Government and the public services committee of ICTU in respect of new entrant pay.  This agreement is benefitting 18,000 teachers and nearly 5,000 SNAs within the education sector. The deal provides for a series of incremental jumps for new entrants. More recently in February 2021 the new public service pay agreement, Building Momentum, was agreed following formal discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Services Committee of ICTU, with consultation and input from the sectors including my Department. There is a specific provision in relation to new entrant teacher pay which allows for the skipping of Point 12 of the pay scale which is a further improvement in pay for new entrant teachers. This measure will build on a previous provision which allowed for the skipping of points 4 and 8 on the post-2011 pay scale and will resolve in full the remaining salary scale issues pertaining to new entrant teachers. <\/p><p>This builds on the series of restorative measures for new entrants have been achieved through the various pay agreements. It shows the benefits that continued engagement and collective bargaining between the Government and the public service unions can bring.<\/p><p>With regard to the issue of Teacher Supply more generally, management bodies and schools have, in recent years, reported difficulties in recruiting teachers. At primary level this relates mainly to the recruitment of substitute teachers and at post-primary to the recruitment of teachers of particular subjects (e.g. STEM, modern foreign languages, Irish, Home Economics) as well as substitute teachers.<\/p><p>In March 2018, my Department established the Steering Group on Teacher Supply. This Group is leading on the identification of the issues, the development of a programme of actions on teacher supply and the oversight of its implementation. Following this, the Teacher Supply Action Plan was published in November 2018 containing a range of actions in four policy areas identified through the work of the Steering Group and engagement with stakeholders. Actions in the Teacher Supply Action Plan included:<\/p><p>- The development by the Department of a data-based model to project teacher demand and supply for both primary and post-primary sectors. The latest updated report &lsquo;Developing a Teacher Demand and Supply Model for Ireland 2021-2038 &ndash; A Technical Report&rsquo;, resulting from this work is available at developing-a-teacher-demand-and-supply-model-for-ireland-2021-2038-a-technical-report.pdf (education.ie)<\/p><p>- Engagement with the HEA, resulting in a number of HEIs commenced new post-primary ITE undergraduate 4-year programmes in 2019 and 2020 in priority subject areas, including mathematics, modern foreign languages and Irish.  More new undergraduate post-primary ITE programmes are also planned to commence in 2021.<\/p><p>- Collaboration between the HEA, on behalf of the Department, and ITE providers on programmes to upskill registered teachers in targeted post-primary subjects (Spanish, mathematics and physics), to be delivered over two years on a part-time, flexible basis.  The Department has agreed to fund two intakes to the programmes, in January 2021 and January 2022. Approximately 160 places will be provided for in each intake across the three programmes. <\/p><p>- A promotional campaign, <b>Teaching Transforms<\/b>, has been ongoing since late 2018 to promote the teaching profession and encourage post-primary and third-level students to apply for programmes of initial teacher education. The various phases of the campaign have used a range of channels, including digital (online video and social media), radio (traditional and digital) and print (national papers and college press) and are aligned to key dates in the educational calendar.<\/p><p>For the 2020\/21 school year, a number of measures have been put in place, including a restriction on the number of days that teachers on career break may be employed as substitute teachers has been suspended and a restriction on job sharing teachers undertaking additional substitution hours has been suspended. <\/p><p>Additional funding of &euro;1m has also been made available for the Student Assistance Fund for Professional Master of Education (PME) students for 2020\/2021. I intend to publish an updated Action Plan in the coming months with new and continuing actions across the four policy areas. Following the success of the upskilling programme Minister Harris and I announced, earlier this year, the intention to expand the numbers on the existing programmes and to also issue a call for a new upskilling programme in the subject of Irish, to commence in the 2021\/22 school year.<\/p><p>From the outset, consultation with educational partners and stakeholders has been a central feature of the teacher supply process.  In this regard, a number of national consultative forums, involving all relevant stakeholders, and regional focus groups for teachers, principals and parents have been held.  Regular consultation also takes place with the teacher unions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04300","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Examinations","counter":588,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04400"},{"type":"question","counter":589,"qnumday":213,"qnumall":"[38596\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the measures in place to ensure that the calculated grades process will be error-free for the leaving certificate results in 2021 following the close to 6,500 affected students in 2020; if her Department has learned from previous errors; if such errors will be avoided for the current sixth year students; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1455","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":590,"content":"<p>The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations and the system of SEC-Accredited Grades for Leaving Certificate 2021. <\/p><p>In view of this I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission for direct reply to you. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Staff","counter":591,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04700"},{"type":"question","counter":592,"qnumday":214,"qnumall":"[38607\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK04800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the progress to date in finalising the pay and conditions for school secretaries and caretakers; the timeline for the finalisation of these issues; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1556","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":593,"content":"<p>As someone who comes from the school sector, I am keenly aware of the vitally important role played by school secretaries and caretakers in the running of our schools. <\/p>  <p>  In recognition of this role, I have put special arrangements in place for this school year whereby schools will be funded to employ a replacement secretary or caretaker in the event that staff who are at very high risk of contracting serious illness from COVID-19 cannot work on the school premises.

This involves direct support in the event of a critical incident, access to national and regional support and development work to build school capacity to support students, access to a NEPS psychologist for responses to queries arising, and access to individual pupil casework via a NEPS psychologist or through the Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments. (SCPA).<\/p>  <p>  NEPS does not maintain waiting lists but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.<\/p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.<\/p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that in 2017 my Department introduced a new model to support pupils with special educational needs. This means schools are now front-loaded with additional teachers to enable them to respond to pupil needs, rather than requiring an assessment to allow them to apply for such additional resource.  This reduces the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require additional teaching support. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.<\/p>  <p>  Furthermore I can inform the Deputy that starting from a level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2016 and following increases allowed in successive Budgets the sanctioned number for NEPS psychologist currently stands at 221 w.t.e. psychologists.<\/p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he\/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK05800","answer":true,"speaker":"1582"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education Schemes","counter":603,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK05900"},{"type":"question","counter":604,"qnumday":218,"qnumall":"[38647\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400110#WRK06000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of schools that have registered for the enhanced summer July provision programme 2021; the number of special schools in each county that have registered for the enhanced summer July provision programme 2021; the number of mainstream schools with special classes that have registered for the enhanced summer July provision programme 2021; the number of schools in each county that have registered to participate in literacy and numeracy camps; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1582"},{"type":"speech","counter":605,"content":"<p>In May 2021 the Government has announced a package of supports to allow primary and post primary to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage, as a COVID-19 pandemic response measure, for summer 2021. <\/p><p>The total funding available to provide summer programmes this year is up to &euro;40 million, a one hundred per cent increase on the allocation for summer programmes in 2020.<\/p><p>The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parent and disability advocacy groups.<\/p><p>The programme aims are to support pupils to maintain their connection with education, to build their confidence and increase their motivation, promote wellbeing and for those who are at key transition stages, help to ensure that they continue their education journey in September either in school or in further\/higher education or training. <\/p><p>The programmes on offer this summer include a new 2-3 week summer programme available to all primary schools and an expansion of the existing programmes in special schools and classes and in DEIS schools. <\/p><p>Existing programmes:<\/p><p>- Literacy and numeracy camps  in DEIS primary schools<\/p><p>- A school-based summer programme in primary special classes and special schools.<\/p><p>- Home-based provision for students with complex needs where no school based programme is available.<\/p><p>New programmes:<\/p><p>- All primary schools have the opportunity to provide a 2 week summer programme for mainstream pupils with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage.<\/p><p>- All Post Primary Schools  have the opportunity to provide a 2 week summer programme for students with complex needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage<\/p><p>Similar to last year children with complex needs entering primary school next September are also eligible to participate in summer programmes.<\/p><p>This range of programmes on offer builds on the success of the expanded programmes that ran last year and incorporates feedback from education stakeholders as to how to better support the programme for all involved in summer 2021.<\/p><p>The Department has addressed concerns previously raised by stakeholders by introducing measures to support schools to encourage schools to offer the programme, funding for a Programme Overseer, preparation time, faster payments of staff, ease of administrative burden on schools and greater guidance materials on programme content.<\/p><p>In addition the programmes can be run at any time over the summer providing schools with autonomy to split the programme weeks to best meet the needs of pupils and staff participating in the programme.

A \"continuing in education\" certificate will issue in August in respect of these children, once completed by the school and returned, their eligibility can be further extended, either to the end of the education cycle or their 18th birthday, whichever comes first.<\/p>  <p>   I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Welfare Schemes","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL00800"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[38219\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL00900","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of removing the requirement to be in receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for at least 15 months in order to qualify for the part-time job incentive scheme; the estimated number of additional recipients that would qualify for such if this change was introduced; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[38224\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL01000","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"if the part-time job incentive scheme is open to jobseekers aged 18 to 25; if she will advise on the decision to set the minimum weekly jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate for the scheme at a rate which locks many young persons out of accessing this scheme in consideration of the scheme requirement for participants to be in receipt of a minimum weekly jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate of &euro;128.60 and the standard rate of &euro;112.70 for young persons on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":228,"qnumall":"[38225\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the estimated cost of removing the minimum weekly rate requirement for the part-time job incentive scheme to extend eligibility to include all jobseekers aged 18 to 25; the estimated number of additional recipients that would qualify for such if this change was enacted; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1604","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":632,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 to 228, inclusive, together.<\/p>  <p>  The Part-time Job Incentive Scheme is an administrative scheme under Jobseeker's Allowance, which allows those who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a special weekly income supplement of &euro;128.60, or &euro;209.70 where a person is receiving an increase for a qualified adult. It is intended as a stepping stone to full time work as a recipient of the payment must be available for and seeking full time employment.<\/p>  <p>  A person must satisfy all of the qualifying conditions of the administrative scheme which include that they must be in receipt of long-term jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for at least 390 days (15 months). Their weekly rate of jobseekers allowance payment must also be higher than the weekly rate of part time job incentive payable.<\/p>  <p>  From a labour market perspective, it is important that the supports available do not inadvertently encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment to young people.  The Department's focus is to increase labour market participation of young people who are not in employment, education, or, training (NEETs). The recently-published Pathways to Work 2021-2025 will invest significantly in employment supports for young people, by introducing and ring-fencing places on work placement programmes, by increasing the availability of apprenticeships, traineeships and education places and by offering employers attractive subsidies when they recruit young unemployed people.<\/p>  <p>  This week, the Government also launched a new Work Placement Experience Programme. This new programme will benefit 10,000 jobseekers of all ages, who have been unemployed for more than six months. This initiative will keep jobseekers close to the labour market and provide them with quality work experience to increase their prospects of returning to employment. The payment rate for participants on this programme is set at &euro;306 per week.<\/p>  <p>  While the age-related rate for a young jobseeker aged 18 to 24 is &euro;112.70, a young person can receive the maximum weekly payment of &euro;203 if he or she participates on an education or training programme, increasing to &euro;306 on the new Work Placement Experience Programme.<\/p>  <p>  It is not possible to identify those jobseekers aged 18 to 25 who may wish to avail of the Part Time Job Incentive scheme. However, if the requirement to be in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance at a higher rate than the part time job incentive weekly rate, along with the current minimum 15 month requirement, were both removed, it is estimated that the total annual cost would be &euro;19.6 million.  This is a differential in cost of &euro;1.65 million over that being paid under jobseeker's allowance and assumes that 20% of the 14,670 people aged 18 to 25 inclusive who are in receipt of a personal rate of jobseeker's allowance would claim the part time job incentive.<\/p>  <p>  Similarly, it is not possible to identify those jobseekers who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for less than 15 months who may wish to avail of the PTJI. However, there are currently over 11,800 people across all ages who are in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for less than 15 months at a rate lower than the equivalent part time job incentive rate. Should 20% of this group claim part time job incentive, the annual cost is estimated at approximately &euro;17.7 million representing a differential in cost of &euro;4.5 million over that being paid under jobseeker's allowance for this group.<\/p>  <p>  Any changes to existing schemes could only be considered in a budgetary context.<\/p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the position for the Deputy. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1450"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":633,"content":"<p>Question No. 227 answered with Question No. 226.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":634,"content":"<p>Question No. 228 answered with Question No. 226.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Public Services Card","counter":635,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL01500"},{"type":"question","counter":636,"qnumday":229,"qnumall":"[38229\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400111#WRL01600","dept":"Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection","question":"the measures being taken to tackle the backlog of appointment requests for public services cards in Cork city; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1521","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":637,"content":"<p>Public Services Card (PSC) appointments were suspended from the beginning of this year due to Level 5 restrictions.

The Commission was given robust powers in accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 to facilitate the gathering of records and witness testimony. In accordance with its statutory functions, and at the conclusion of its investigation, the Commission submitted a report based on the evidence received by it, setting out the facts it established in relation to the matters referred to it for investigation. The Commission&rsquo;s interim and final reports have all been published.<\/p>  <p>  Within its final report, the Commission includes a number of chapters with detailed statistical information on the mothers and children who were resident by individual institution. These data sets were developed from the institutional records available to the Commission. The information is reported on a calendar year basis and covers areas such as; the number of admissions; the entry pathways; age on admission; occupation; previous pregnancy; marital status; length of stay; exit pathways; maternal deaths and child deaths. In the case of Miss Carr's, the information established by the Commission is reflected the body of Chapter 25 rather than in a separate chapter. <\/p>  <p>  The Commission's final report states that 195 hearings were held by the Commission, with 64 former residents coming before the Commission to give evidence. An additional 304 who were resident as mothers, and 228 who were resident as babies\/children, provided testimony to the Confidential Committee. The Commission noted that these mothers came from 12 different institutions and the children also came from 12 different institutions, but not the same 12 as the mothers.<\/p>  <p>  In recognising the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of so many, including those who appeared before the Commission and the Confidential Committee, the Commission produced a report of a general nature, as it was tasked to do. Data was therefore compiled in a way that preserved the anonymity of those to which the data relates. For this reason, the data provided by the Commission does not facilitate a correlation between the data presented on former residents and those who provided testimony or other evidence to the Commission.    <\/p>  <p>  My Department is the data controller for all the personal data contained in the archive and associated records and databases since 28th February 2021, when the Commission was dissolved in law.

The Programme for Government commits to reforming the childcare system to create one that brings together the best of community and private childcare provision, is focused on children&rsquo;s rights and quality outcomes, reduces inequalities, supports staff retention, and substantially reduces costs to parents. <\/p>  <p>  State investment in this sector has increased by an unprecedented 141% since 2015. This funding has been used to remove barriers to access so that children can enrol and meaningfully participate in high-quality Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age Childcare (SAC). It has, for example, funded a second year of the universal Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) pre-school programme and enabled the introduction of the National Childcare Scheme (NCS). <\/p>  <p>  The ECCE pre-school programme provides for ELC provision for all children in the two years before they begin primary school for fifteen hours per week, entirely free for parents. <\/p>  <p>  Families may also be entitled to subsidies under the National Childcare Scheme. The NCS represents the first ever statutory entitlement to financial support for childcare in Ireland. The Scheme aims to improve outcomes for children, reduce poverty, facilitate labour activation, and tangibly reduce the cost of childcare for tens of thousands of families.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme comprises two types of subsidies:<\/p>  <p>  - A universal subsidy is payable for children between the ages of 24 weeks and 36 months (or until the child qualifies for the ECCE programme if later) who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider.  The universal subsidy is not means-tested and is available to all qualifying families of any income level. <\/p>  <p>  - An income assessed subsidy is payable for children from 24 weeks to 15 years of age who are availing of childcare services from an approved childcare service provider. The level of subsidy is determined by the family&rsquo;s assessable income (i.e. gross income minus tax, PRSI and other deductibles and minus any applicable multiple child discount).           <\/p>  <p>  Information on the Scheme can be found at www.ncs.gov.ie and by phoning the Parent Support Centre at 01 906 8530, Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm. Parents can also contact their local City\/County Childcare Committee to learn more about Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare supports available to them. Details about local CCCs can be found at www.myccc.ie  .<\/p>  <p>  Looking to the future, First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, commits to at least doubling investment in ELC and SAC in the decade to 2028. A key vehicle to ensure that such significant additional investment delivers for children, families and the State will be a new funding model. The new funding model will be the framework for additional investment in services in return for clear evidence of quality and affordability to ensure effective use of public funding. <\/p>  <p>  An Expert Group has been leading the work on developing this new funding model since 2019. The Group is independently chaired and includes national and international experts in ELC and SAC systems, funding, quality, economics, and relevant policy experts from the Government Departments who will be involved in implementing the new funding model. They have met seventeen times to date and it is expected that their report will be submitted in November 2021. It is anticipated that the Expert Group&rsquo;s work will inform the Budget 2022 process and Department officials are already engaged in this. <\/p>  <p>  ELC and SAC services are private businesses and are free to set their own policies regarding the charging of fees and contract conditions. First 5 sets out as part of the reform of the funding model, the development of an appropriate mechanism to control fees charged to parents in return for increased State investment in affordability, quality and sustainability. As set out in the Terms of Reference for the Expert Group, an essential and top priority for this Group will be to make recommendations for a mechanism to control fee rates for different types of provision for ELC\/SAC. The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to examine the approach of other European countries to set a cap on parental fees, irrespective of income.<\/p>  <p>The research partner for the funding model project, Frontier Economics, has produced eight working papers, with three that directly address affordability issues including international comparisons of fees and public investment, approaches to funding the early learning and care sector, and mechanisms to control fees charged to parents.

The off-the-job training for these programmes is delivered in Training Centres or Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities.  It is these programmes which were those most impacted by the shutdown of on-site learning activity in 2020 and 2021 given the practical nature of the apprenticeships; training centres and workshops having been closed for 9 of the past 14 months.<\/p>  <p>  End of May figures indicated that over 10,000 apprentices were waiting for access to Phase 2, 4 and 6 off-the-job training, of these 3,500 craft apprentices had been waiting over 12 months. <\/p>  <p>  Craft apprentices were prioritised for a return to on-site learning on 8 March 2021.  Delivery of off-the-job phases is proceeding, and will continue over the summer, subject to public health advice and with restricted numbers. This approach will assist institutions and providers in preparing and organising the safe return of larger numbers in the autumn.  <\/p>  <p>  The Government has committed to a significant increase in onsite attendance in the tertiary education sector in the next academic year.  Following consultation with sectoral stakeholders and following Government approval, A Safe Return: Plan for a safe return to on-site Further and Higher Education and Research in 2021\/22 was recently published.  The Plan reflects the essential nature of higher and further education and training including apprenticeships.  It provides for comprehensive on-site activity for the next academic year, with almost full scale on-site activities. <\/p>  <p>  To support the Plan, the sector has developed a Pact of actions and commitments to ensure that the return is safe. With specific reference to the issue of backlogs, under this Pact, institutions and providers have committed to addressing backlogs and deferred learning outcomes. Similarly, stakeholder bodies have committed to engaging with institutions and providers to achieve significant increases to on-site teaching, learning, assessment and research, to progress mitigating actions and to address backlogs.<\/p>  <p>  A three-step plan to tackle the backlog in craft apprenticeship off-the-job training over the next 12 to 15 months is currently being worked on between SOLAS and further and higher education providers. Step 1 of the plan includes an increase in the number of training workshops available across further and higher education from September 2021 onwards. Steps 2 and 3 involve tailored emergency approaches to accelerate the throughput of apprentices at Phases 2 and 6 for a designated period of time. <\/p>  <p>  &euro;20 million in additional capital expenditure has been allocated to SOLAS and the HEA to facilitate an additional 4,000 craft apprenticeship places across the system in the coming period and into the future.  This is in addition to &euro;12 million which had already been allocated to support additional classes and teaching capacity to ameliorate COVID-19 measures.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400113#WRN00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1493"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Data","counter":772,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400113#WRN00500"},{"type":"question","counter":773,"qnumday":275,"qnumall":"[38421\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400113#WRN00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the breakdown of the expenditure heading Training People for Employment of the National Training Fund; the full range of course covered, the number of places provided; the average cost per places; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1501","askee":"1624"},{"type":"speech","counter":774,"content":"<p>SOLAS has declared a spend of &euro;125.5m on training people for employment in 2020.

This followed on from the work of a sub-group of the Forum on Anti-Social Behaviour, which I chair, to consider community-based approaches to address the misuse of scramblers and quad bikes as part of the overall package of Government measures to tackle the issue.<\/p>  <p>  This initiative is centred around Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) who are being invited to lead on the development of proposals for community-based interventions to work with young people involved in anti-social use of these vehicles and related crime and anti-social behaviour.  GYDPs will be required to consult with other local interests, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and to create a local consortium which will include the local authority.  It is envisaged that the local authority partner will in general be responsible for provision of tracks and related facilities.<\/p>  <p>  In May, my Department invited the GYDPs to present proposals for the scheme to offer positive alternatives to young people engaged in anti-social use of scramblers, including specific contact with GYDPs in areas that are most affected by this issue. <\/p>  <p>  The community-based initiative is open to receive proposals from local areas, coordinated through GYDPs, and it is open to any GYDP to submit a proposal. The intention is that proposals submitted before the end of July may be eligible for support in the current year, subject to assessment of the details of the proposal. I can assure the Deputy that I will keep the operation of the scheme under review, with a view to providing appropriate support for local areas where there are significant problems with the misuse of scramblers, quad bikes and similar vehicles.<\/p>  <p>  I should stress that this initiative is focussed on young people at risk of crime and anti-social behaviour and specifically anti-social use of these vehicles.  It is not intended to duplicate the responsibilities of mainstream youth services or to fund motocross or similar sports as such.<\/p>  <p>  It is hoped that this combined approach of increased Garda powers to tackle the misuse of scramblers, while at the same time creating alternative options for those who wish to use such vehicles safely and legally, will have a significant impact in tackling the problem. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, members of the public who are concerned about any individual misuse of scramblers should contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1618"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na","counter":863,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO02000"},{"type":"question","counter":864,"qnumday":305,"qnumall":"[38694\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO02100","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; by rank attached to Cavan-Monaghan community engagement unit; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1513","askee":"1450"},{"type":"speech","counter":865,"content":"<p>As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

As the pandemic continued, additional support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been delivered through the Health Service Executive (HSE).<\/p>  <p>  As of 9th July 2021, 7,631 claims had been submitted as part of the Scheme. In total, &euro;134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.<\/p>  <p>  Due to the ongoing high level of risk associated with COVID-19 during this period, the Department of Health extended the scheme twice, far beyond the originally planned timescale of three months. The further extension of the scheme was outlined in the Government&rsquo;s Plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19', published in September 2020. This provided assurance of the Scheme&rsquo;s availability and a planned timeframe of operation to the end of June 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The cessation of TAPS at the end of June, as planned and previously announced, was communicated with all relevant stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland &ndash; the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector.<\/p>  <p>  There has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community and in nursing homes due to the rollout of the National Vaccination Programme &ndash; COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes are now at a very low level compared with the first quarter of the year and, overall, the epidemiological situation is very positive. It is the Department&rsquo;s understanding that currently there is one open outbreak in a nursing home.<\/p>  <p>   (Please note that the cyberattack on the HSE on 14 May 2021 has prevented the routine notification of cases, associated deaths and outbreaks of COVID-19 to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system. As an interim measure, provisional epidemiological reports are being prepared but have not undergone the data validation procedures undertaken through CIDR. For this reason, data continues to be provisional at this time.)<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. Availability of outbreak assistance is subject to the overall sanctioned amount of &euro;42m for 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The substantial package of non-financial supports outlined below will continue to be provided for the time being:<\/p>  <p>  - Provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The continued supply of PPE is a key support mechanism and will be provided in line with clinical and public health recommendations<\/p>  <p>  - The COVID-19 Response Teams established to support Public Health Outbreak teams covering all residential services as well as home support settings. All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;<\/p>  <p>  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;<\/p>  <p>  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.<\/p>  <p>  - IPC support and advice;<\/p>  <p>  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.<\/p>  <p>  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.<\/p>  <p>  It is also important to reflect that all nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well-established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents. Nursing homes are required, by law, to ensure that procedures consistent with the standards for the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections published by HIQA are implemented by staff. The current infection prevention and control standards have been in operation since 2018. Good and effective IPC procedures should be in place across the entire health and social care service as a matter of course.<\/p>  <p>  In February 2021, a revised plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2021 Plan: The Path Ahead' was published by the Government. This plan recognises the need for longer-term reform of both older persons and nursing home care, broadly reflecting the lessons learned from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel and the pandemic. However, these structural reforms, including the policy and regulatory framework, extend beyond the scope of a temporary financial support scheme aimed at a specific, time-limited public health objective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO02900","answer":true,"speaker":"1614"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":873,"content":"<p>Question No. 307 answered with Question No. 306.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":874,"content":"<p>Question No. 308 answered with Question No. 306.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service","counter":875,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO03200"},{"type":"question","counter":876,"qnumday":309,"qnumall":"[30789\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400114#WRO03300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"when a person (details supplied) will be facilitated; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1518","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":877,"content":"<p>As this Parliamentary Question relates to an operational issue, it is a matter for the HSE.

Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency or the Health Products Regulatory Authority.<\/p>  <p>  In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria, including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact.<\/p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).<\/p>  <p>  I am advised by the HSE that, in April 2020, the NCPE received a reimbursement application dossier for Onasemnogene abeparvovec (Zolgensma). On 13 May 2020, the NCPE completed a rapid review with respect to this application and recommended a full Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of Zolgensma compared with the current standard of care.<\/p>  <p>  The HTA was undertaken as a part of the Beneluxa collaboration between Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, with Austria acting as a reviewer in the Belgian procedure.<\/p>  <p>  The HTA was completed in May 2021 and an assessment summary is available on the NCPE's website. At the conclusion of this HTA, the NCPE recommended that Zolgensma not be considered for reimbursement unless cost effectiveness could be improved relative to existing treatments. Pricing\/reimbursement negotiations have commenced July 2021.<\/p>  <p>  A final decision on the pricing\/reimbursement application for Zolgensma will be made in accordance with the 2013 Health Act.<\/p>  <p>  Questions relating to specific individual patients are an operational issue and are therefore a matter for the HSE.

Other key areas of work include expanding access to contraception, free of charge, through the National Condom Distribution Service; sexually transmitted infection (STI) services, progressing a population survey on sexual health and improving sexual health education, training and resources, including in schools, higher and further education.<\/p>  <p>  A mid-term review of the Sexual Health Strategy was commissioned by the HSE Sexual Health and Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) and carried out in 2018 which outlines the progress made in the implementation of the strategy.\u00a0 The key contributors to success highlighted in the report include the composition and expertise of the programme team, the cross functional approach (education, training, communications, funding, research, clinical) and the strong engagement and collaboration with stakeholders throughout all aspects of implementation of the strategy.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  A Mapping exercise and Needs Assessment of existing clinical sexual health services and laboratory services was also conducted, and a series of reports published in 2018. Following publication of the reports, two consultation workshops were hosted by the HSE Sexual Health &amp;amp; Crisis Pregnancy Programme (SHCPP) in May 2018. These workshops were held as a means of engaging key stakeholders with the findings from the needs assessment and the mapping exercise and to identify areas for action in relation to sexual health services in Ireland. These actions have informed the development of subsequent annual SHCPP business plans. <\/p>  <p>  Given the breadth of the Strategy, its original aims and objectives will remain relevant beyond 2020. It has therefore been agreed with the SHCPP to extend the lifetime of the current Strategy to the end of 2021. It was originally intended to review and refresh the Strategy in 2020, but this was postponed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, work on this review, led by the Department of Health, has now commenced in Q2, 2021.<\/p>  <p>  The review process is currently underway; the initial phase consists of focus group meetings with key stakeholders, including clinical and public health staff, the SHCPP team, those working in the STI clinics, the Education sector, the Department of Health and Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, the research and academic sector and organisations representing the LGBTI+ community. The views of stakeholders are being collated and the Strategy will be reviewed, in order to inform the future direction of the next iteration of the strategy. The terms of reference of the new Strategy will be determined following the conclusions of the review process, but will include current areas of work, which remain fully funded. <\/p>  <p>  Women&rsquo;s health has been given significant priority in the Department; the future direction of this area of work is currently being considered by the Department&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Health Taskforce, in collaboration with a range of external stakeholders and partners, including the HSE and NWCI.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) processes the applications received for such licences, on behalf of the Department of Health. The applications are assessed against what is legally permitted under the current Misuse of Drugs legislative framework.<\/p><p>This legislation states that cannabis and its derivatives are controlled by virtue of the Misuse of Drugs framework. Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, cannabis means any part of the plant of the genus cannabis but excludes the following after separation from the rest of the plant:<\/p><p>- the mature stalk and fibre produced from it; and<\/p><p>- the seeds.<\/p><p>Any other part of the plant not explicitly excluded under the Act is cannabis for the purposes of the Act. As such, only the seed, mature stalk or fibre of the hemp plant may legally be supplied onwards. As a consequence, other parts of the plant must be destroyed.<\/p><p>Consideration as to whether a product contains a substance controlled under the Misuse of Drugs framework falls under the remit of officers authorised under the Misuse of Drugs legislative framework, which include, officers of the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<\/p><p>When hemp-derived products are placed on the market as &lsquo;food&rsquo; in line with the General Food Law (Regulation (EC) No. 178\/2002), numerous other regulations pertaining to the EU food legislation may apply, and are enforced by official agencies under service contract to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. The flowers\/buds of the Cannabis plant fall outside the definition of food in Regulation (EC) No. 178\/2002 as they are considered narcotic drugs in line with the UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961. Therefore the marketing of cannabis flowers or buds on their own as food in the EU is not permitted. While hemp seeds do not naturally produce or contain cannabinoids including cannabidiol (CBD), there may be varying levels of cannabinoids found in fibres and stalks of the hemp plant.<\/p><p>Ireland does not consider CBD derived from legally-cultivated hemp by cold pressing as a novel food. This means cold-pressed CBD from legally-cultivated hemp can be sold as food in Ireland without requiring a novel food authorisation, subject to compliance with all other applicable food legislation. However, where cannabis-derived CBD products have been refined by purification, concentration, etc., they are considered novel foods that must be authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015\/2283 prior to marketing. The rationale for this position is not related to the legal use of authorised extraction solvents, but is due to the potential safety threats posed by the higher concentration of desirable components and possible co-purified undesirable components, where they do not have a significant history of consumption prior to 1997. This general position has been agreed by all EU Member States as expressed in the entry for &ldquo;Cannabinoids&rdquo; in the EU Novel Food Catalogue <i>ec.europa.eu\/food\/food\/novel-food\/novel-food-catalogue_en<\/i>.<\/p><p>The addition of synthetic or concentrated forms of plant-derived CBD to a hemp seed-derived food in order to boost the levels of CBD also makes that final food a novel food which must be authorised in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015\/2283 before it can be placed on the EU market.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400117#WRR03700","answer":true,"speaker":"1623"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1117,"content":"<p>Question No. 391 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1118,"content":"<p>Question No. 392 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1119,"content":"<p>Question No. 393 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1120,"content":"<p>Question No. 394 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1121,"content":"<p>Question No. 395 answered with Question No. 390.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":1122,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400117#WRR04300"},{"type":"question","counter":1123,"qnumday":396,"qnumall":"[31326\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400117#WRR04400","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the action he is taking to ensure there is no delay in members of the public receiving their second dose of a vaccine (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1460","askee":"1623"},{"type":"speech","counter":1124,"content":"<p>On 4 June  I announced a shorter interval between doses for the Vaxzevria&reg; (AstraZeneca) vaccine.

CHI has been in the process of developing the structure to deliver this model over the first quarter of this year.<\/p>  <p>  CHI received funding towards a new service to address the needs of children, adolescents and their families living with complex pain in Ireland. This interdisciplinary service consists of a consultant with special interest in pain management (1 WTE), administration (1.2 WTE), clinical nurse specialist (1.0 WTE), advanced nurse practitioner (1.2WTE), occupational therapist (1.0 WTE), physiotherapist (1.0 WTE) and psychologist (1.0 WTE). CHI have advised that all posts are in place except for the consultant position. Unfortunately, recruitment for this post has so far been unsuccessful and is still ongoing. The post was advertised last year but did not attract candidates. It has now been redesigned to structure it slightly differently, and it&rsquo;s hoped the way the post has been configured now will successfully attract suitable candidates.  A locum consultant (0.5 WTE) has been hired on an interim basis until such time as the permanent consultant position is filled. <\/p>  <p>  The CHI pain team works across all CHI sites. The new service will provide a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to pain rehabilitation in keeping with evidence-based treatments that are recognised globally.<\/p>  <p>  CHI have confirmed that their pain team have recently engaged with all service users who have been informed of the change of service model .They have also been sent a questionnaire which will assist the team to triage patients appropriately.<\/p>  <p>  Meanwhile, CHI have confirmed that all service users have access to the Clinical Nurse Specialists and Advanced Nurse Practitioners who are available to address any urgent queries under the governance of the pain consultant.

The combination of supports in the location, outreach supports, and remote supports provides an overall quantum of support to service users of over 60% at the end of January. The increase in day service capacity was supported by additional funding of &euro;30 million provided in Budget 2021 to increase capacity in buildings and provide extra staff. This funding provided an increase in day services by an average of one day a week for 14,940 people against September 2020 service levels.<\/p>  <p>  For the duration of the COVID-19 emergency day service capacity is reduced, this is due to the physical limitations of the buildings available, the lack of mainstream community activities, and the continued restrictions imposed by social distancing guidance. Many people with disabilities have underlying health conditions, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains, unfortunately so too does the need for these restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccination process for staff and service users is well underway across day services, and all service providers should now be delivering a minimum of 60% of pre-COVID levels of location-based supports. For those in residential services, currently their day service supports are largely being provided in their residence, however some service users have returned to their day service location, and it is now expected that all residential service users that received their day service at a location pre-COVID should begin to resume location-based day service supports.<\/p>  <p>  The HSE is in the process of establishing the vaccination status of all staff and service users in day services. Once established, the HSE will engage with Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) on what further easing of restrictions can appropriately be applied to day services. Those attending day services have been vaccinated as part of cohort 4, people aged 16-69 years and at very high risk of severe COVID-19 disease. The administration of the second vaccine dose for this cohort began in the week beginning May 10th and is expected to be complete by early July.<\/p>  <p>  The IPC guidance are kept under constant review and updates will be provided in the months ahead on further restoration of day services.  <\/p>  <p>  With regard to older person's services, the position is as follows. <\/p>  <p>  Day centres are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population and play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their own communities. The pandemic and associated restrictions has had a profound impact across society and especially for our older population. <\/p>  <p>  All Community Health Organisations through the National Older Persons Office were requested in April 2021 to provide information on the status of their Day Care Services in order to ascertain the level of service that could resume on receipt of updated public health guidance.  As a result, it was intended that approximately 100 day centres would re-open week beginning 5 July. It was also intended that an additional 55 centres would resume in July and August, with a further 90 centres that require works expected to reopen before the end of the year.   It was indicated that these dates may be subject to change as the HSE continues to deal with the significant challenge of the on-going cyber attack.   <\/p>  <p>  Since then updated Public Health guidance to support the re-opening of Day Care Services for Older People was provided in June 2021 to facilitate re-opening plans. Following on from this a further information request issued to HSE Services to obtain an update on re-opening plans. The process for reopening of the centres has already commenced and it is expected that more centres will reopen in the coming weeks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400119#WRT05100","answer":true,"speaker":"1484"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":1250,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400119#WRT05300"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Sector","counter":1249,"url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400119#WRT05200"},{"type":"question","counter":1250,"qnumday":446,"qnumall":"[38136\/21]","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2021071400119#WRT05300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the status of a felling licence for a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1593","askee":"1546"},{"type":"speech","counter":1251,"content":"<p>A tree felling application for the person named was received in 2019 and a harvest plan has been provided.

The implementation of the actions detailed in the Strategy is regarded as a priority and critical to the further development of the organic sector in Ireland.<\/p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government has set a new target for organic farming, to meet changing consumer trends in this area. While the EU Commission&rsquo;s objective of reaching at least 25% of the EU&rsquo;s agricultural land under organic farming by 2030 is highly ambitious, there is a commitment to align Ireland&rsquo;s organic land area with that of the current EU average of approximately 7.5% over the lifetime of this Government. The Programme aims to focus on developing domestic and international organic markets, to ensure that farmers have access to premium-paying markets for their produce.<\/p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also focuses particularly on maximising potential opportunities in the organic sector, the supply of quality Irish grains to an expanding food and drinks industry, and opportunities for home-grown proteins in animal feeds.<\/p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to develop the CAP Strategic Plan in consultation with stakeholders through the CAP Consultative Committee and other forums.   Consideration is currently being given to the measures that will be supported under the new CAP Strategic Plan, and stakeholders will be further consulted on this shortly.

This is reflected in ongoing Government work including that aimed at enhancing community policing, rural transport links and tackling social inclusion. Focus on actions to address the issue of isolation in communities has become more important than ever due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p><p>Many of my Department's policies and funding programmes contribute to addressing isolation issues in communities. <\/p><p>Key interventions include funding<b><\/b>the <b>Seniors Alert Scheme, <\/b>which<b><\/b>enables older people to live securely, with peace of mind, in their homes through the provision of personal monitored alarms, ensuring contact is maintained with those who are vulnerable. In addition, as part of the Department&rsquo;s <b>COVID-19 Action Plan<\/b>, increased support was provided for older people through our funding partnership with ALONE for their crisis telephone support line.<\/p><p><b>The Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP)<\/b>is Ireland&rsquo;s primary social inclusion funding intervention, delivered locally by Local Development Companies (LDCs) to help those in the greatest need access supports to enable participation in communities. LDCs have put in place various measures to ensure supports continue to be delivered to vulnerable and isolated people throughout the COVID-19 crisis. These include:<\/p><p>- Online supports delivered  via telephone, email, Zoom, with additional support to individuals with limited access to technology.<\/p><p>- LDCs that operate  a &ldquo;friendly call&rdquo; service to elderly people saw an increase in demand for the service with some LDCs mobilizing local community groups to become involved in making regular contact with older, vulnerable isolated people during COVID.<\/p><p>- LDCs supported an increase in demand for Meals on Wheels services and foodbanks, particularly for those not able to travel to shops and those experiencing food poverty. <\/p><p>The National Social Enterprise Policy aims to enable <b>social enterprises<\/b>increase their social, environmental and economic impact. Many social enterprises are based in rural or isolated areas and provide services to communities that may not otherwise be available. <\/p><p>Following the closure of all public libraries in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic Library Authorities (LAs) quickly identified the need for a service to deliver library items to the homes of isolating community members, care facilities and Direct Provision Centres. Currently more than half of our library authorities are delivering library stock to the vulnerable and housebound. This service is highly valued by the customers who received books, audiobooks, CDs and DVDs along with a welcome friendly chat with the driver. <\/p><p>The library service also operates a network of mobile libraries which provides an invaluable service for library users in rural communities, providing inclusion and connection to many remote areas. The vehicles offer books and other library items along with free Wi-Fi access. <\/p><p>The library service also provides members with free online access to thousands of eBooks, eAudiobooks, magazines, newspapers and training courses. <\/p><p>As part of the Government&rsquo;s Keep Well programme, public libraries distributed 50,000 free food growing kits through the Grow it Forward campaign in March 2021. This initiative is designed to help the nation eat well by inspiring and supporting people to grow some of their own food at home while connecting with friends and family to join them.<\/p><p>The current <b>LEADER Programme<\/b>functions under EAFRD Priority 6 &ndash; promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas.
