In accordance with public health guidelines, the wearing of face coverings is optional for members and witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Brian Hill, audit manager.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The committee has advised the HBFI that it may also wish to examine the issuance of bonds and unfinished estates during the engagement.

As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

It operates as a commercial State entity, providing finance at market rates for commercially-viable residential developments.<\/p> <p>  HBFI was incorporated as a designated activity company in December 2018 and the company&rsquo;s share capital is owned solely by the Minister for Finance.  A group entity, Home Building Finance Ireland (Lending) Designated Activity Company, was subsequently incorporated in early January 2019 and it is a 100%-owned subsidiary of HBFI.  The operations of HBFI commenced on 28 January 2019, with access to an initial loan fund of &euro;730 million to be made available by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  At the time of its launch, HBFI&rsquo;s initial loan product was targeted at small- and medium-sized builders and was limited to providing senior debt funding for residential projects of ten units or more, up to a maximum of &euro;35 million per project.<\/p> <p>  During 2020, HBFI significantly expanded the scope of its lending.  It now offers funding for projects to build apartments where lending of up to &euro;75 million can be provided; for small residential development projects of fewer than ten units; for social housing projects contracted for sale to a local authority or an approved housing body, AHB; and a &euro;300 million momentum fund, which was launched as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic to provide funding to established developers for larger-scale developments in prime locations. <\/p> <p>  Naturally, HBFI was still in the initial stages of scaling up its operation in 2020.  From the date of inception up until the end of 2020, HBFI had approved offers of loans totalling &euro;395 million, but significantly less funding had been drawn down by borrowers.  As the statement of financial position discloses, HBFI had loans in issue by the end of 2020 to developers of just under &euro;37 million, and HBFI had borrowed a total of &euro;37.3 million from the ISIF to facilitate this lending.<\/p> <p>  HBFI&rsquo;s operating expenses in 2020 amounted to almost &euro;5.7 million, of which &euro;2.6 million was paid in respect of salaries to HBFI staff.  Members may wish to note that HBFI staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, seconded to HBFI.  The NTMA also provides administration supports to HBFI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Income earned by HBFI in 2020 amounted to &euro;864,000.  This included net interest income of &euro;544,000 and other income of &euro;320,000.  HBFI incurred a loss of just under &euro;4.8 million for 2020.<\/p> <p>  I issued unqualified audit opinions on the 2020 financial statements of the HBFI group, and of the subsidiary company. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Ms Deering is very welcome.

I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chair has already introduced.<\/p> <p>  HBFI is a Government initiative to increase the supply of new homes, for owner-occupiers, renters and social housing, by providing loans on commercial terms to small, medium and large housebuilders for commercially-viable developments throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Last month, we published a performance update that showed we had grown total loan approvals to &euro;835 million as at the end of December 2021.  The funding we have approved can deliver 3,729 new homes in 71 developments in 18 counties.  Drawdowns have already taken place in respect of 57% of the facilities we had approved at the end of December.  This shows that the houses and apartments being built with HBFI funding are being completed quickly, thereby meeting some of the immense demand for housing.  Furthermore, I am pleased to say that our strong progress has continued into 2022, with the result that, as of the end February, our total loan approvals have grown to more than &euro;1 billion.  These will support the potential delivery of over 4,400 new homes across 20 counties.<\/p> <p>  HBFI funding has been effective for several reasons.  By listening to our stakeholders and focusing on developments where housebuilders experience difficulty raising funding from traditional sources, HBFI addresses the gaps in the traditional marketplace and provides a rigorous but fast loan approval process.  Our focus on supporting incremental housing supply gives us a flexibility that may not always be available from mainstream banks.  Equally, while mainstream banks often gravitate towards urban areas, we have a national remit to try to support new home supply in every county and not just the big cities.<\/p><p>Our product range will take into account the market reality that some housing schemes will simply be too small for other lenders to support.  Through our strong stakeholder engagement across the public and private sectors, the HBFI can identify trends and gaps in the funding market from the ground up.<\/p><p> However, not all the challenges can be predicted, as the Covid pandemic has demonstrated.  The HBFI&rsquo;s ability to respond to the risk that there may be further, albeit temporary, challenges as a result of Covid-19 impacting on the timing of future supply brought about the creation of the momentum fund.  As the initial &euro;200 million was fully committed within three months, the strength of demand resulted in the HBFI adding a further &euro;100 million to the fund.  The success of the fund has continued to the extent that it is now more than 90% utilised and the time is right to close it to new applications.  The momentum fund is just one example of how the HBFI&rsquo;s agile business model can respond to disruptions to residential development finance and tailor its offerings to the areas where demand exists the most.<\/p><p> In reality, the HBFI is just one part of the solution to the supply-demand imbalance that exists, which is causing so much difficulty for owner-occupiers, renters and those in need of social housing.  We feel strongly that increasing supply across the market is beneficial for everyone.  By funding developments aimed at owner-occupiers, we are helping these people move out of the rental sector and freeing up homes for other renters, thereby increasing the supply in that sector.  By funding new homes for rental, we build on that progress, increase the choice available to renters and try to help alleviate some of the pricing pressure existing in that market.<\/p><p> Access to development finance for all types of housing remains a key issue for homebuilders and is vital to support the continued delivery of housing throughout the State.  Through the strategies I have outlined today, the HBFI seeks to address the financing challenge and ensure that finance is available where the level of demand makes a development viable.  We take great pride in being part of each of the developments we finance and in seeing foundations being dug and diggers at work.  That is what the HBFI is all about; turning the finance we have available into homes.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening remarks.  I hope this has given the committee a better understanding of the work of the HBFI.  My colleagues and I will do our best to answer any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The first member to speak is Deputy McAuliffe who has 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Deering for her statement and the Comptroller and Auditor General for his reports.  I do not want to paraphrase what Ms Deering said, but I will focus on one line where she said the HBFI identified gaps in the existing fund available to creditors and did so in an efficient and rigorous way.  I am thinking back to the development of the HBFI.  In many ways, many of the new policy tools that have come in, such as Housing for All and so on, have increased the number of policy tools available to tackle the housing market.  While all homes built are very important and help to solve the housing crisis - as Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage I am very conscious of that - the role of members of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold the HBFI to account for the policy area under its remit.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the idea of small and medium-sized builders and the access they have to credit.  Would the representatives say that was the core origin of the creation of the HBFI?  It certainly seems to have comprised much of the early work of the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  When the HBFI was established, the initial assumption was that finance would be more concerned with small and medium-sized developers or housebuilders, especially outside urban areas.  We see that as a real gap.  In fact, 65% of all the homes we have funded are in schemes that are being built with fewer than 50 homes.  That is a reality.  Some 63% of all the homes we have funded are outside the Dublin area.  Both those factors are clear evidence that there is less availability of finance and, therefore, more demand outside the main areas.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we did very early was a strategic review and a large piece of market research.  We identified gaps even beyond that.  If we look at small housing schemes, when the HBFI was initially set up, the assumption was the demand would be in units greater than ten.  Actually, 14% of all housing supply in Ireland over the past number of years is in schemes of fewer than ten units.  We brought out a product specifically to support housebuilders who want to build between five and ten units to try to fill that gap further.  Equally, on the other side of the spectrum, we saw real challenges with apartment delivery and the financing of apartment delivery schemes so we brought out a product specifically for that.  That was the message I was trying to get across in my opening statement.  There is not one housing market; there are multiple markets.  There are multiple challenges facing those markets and we have tried to respond to the gaps as they emerge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I want to focus on the HBFI's move away from focusing on that idea of small to medium sized towards the momentum fund, which I will discuss.

I see it as an add-on to what we were doing because those gaps very much existed in small and medium-sized scheme funding.  As I said, 65% of all the schemes are fewer than 50 units.  That is a very important focus for us.  We went a step further than the original offering by bringing out a product for those smaller schemes.  It is very important for us.<\/p> <p>  I believe that in our role as a funder, and our mandate is to increase supply, we have to recognise that the gaps will be at different parts of the market and sometimes that will be timebound.  The Deputy may want to reference the momentum fund, which is a prime example of something that was created as a result of the pandemic.  Our role was to step in and respond to that factor. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Okay.  I will come back to that.  Clearly, the HBFI has not seen the success in drawdowns for those smaller projects that it might have.  Of almost &euro;395 million approved facilities, the drawdown has just been approximately &euro;37 million, which is 10%.  I am trying to get to the bottom of why that is happening in the market so I can understand it from a policy perspective.

The Deputy is right that there is obviously a gap between the &euro;395 million that was there to the end of 2020 and the drawdowns at that point.  That is the same irrespective of any housing scheme we fund because it will take a period of time.  First, from the time we approve the fund, it takes about three to six months on average before funding is drawn down.  The whole nature of development finance is we only lend the money as the activity is happening.  It will take a further 21 months on average before the full amount of money we propose for a scheme is drawn down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>As the HBFI heads into year three, was 10% of total approvals a target it hoped to exceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00900","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Is that in terms of drawdowns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B01100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The reality is the construction programmes we approved in, for example, the early part of 2020, have not yet delivered to schedule.

That is not the quickest or most efficient use of the funding we have available.  The reality is that from the time we approve a facility, a number of things have to happen.  First, there is a due diligence process to make sure all the checks and balances are in place because we are lending State money but on the other side of it, the housebuilders have to mobilise the resources available, including the labour and materials, to get on site.

I can see how an organisation that is struggling to get the volume it wants can very easily come up with a new tool, allocate more than 40% of the funds and start to then reach volumes that could be met by other financial institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#C01100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will deal specifically with the momentum fund and then I will come back to one of the Deputy's other points.

I am aware that Ms Deering made the case earlier that she was trying to help that sector as well.  However, are we sure that sector was really struggling to get finance?  For example, if a constituent went to the local authority tomorrow to get money under the local authority loan scheme or, previously, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, two letters from private financial institutions would have to be produced stating he or she could not get a loan.  There would also be other rigorous checks.  Ms Deering clarified that the developers who finished up with 80% of the public money did not have to produce any of that documentation.  Does she not find that odd?  She mentioned that her organisation did not want to put the applicants through the rigorous process of going around the houses looking for money before coming back to it, but that does not take long.  One can get the information from a bank or other financial institution in a day.  If a developer or builder presents balanced books to a bank or financial institution and shows evidence of the asset, secured land, planning permission and a preliminary design that has been done, he or she will get a fairly quick answer within a week; it does not take months.<\/p> <p>  A weakness in the momentum fund and the overall scheme is that critical check is not in place.  What happened is simply that, in the case of the fund, more than 80% of it ended up funding apartments in Dublin that finished up in the hands of private developers charging a rent of &euro;3,100 per month.  That is crazy money by comparison with rents in other European cities.  Before the crash, we finished up with the most expensive site in the world in Ballsbridge.  We all remember that and what happened.  Some of the people involved wound up in America.  We remember the madness of all that.  Are we not driving ourselves into a crazy situation again using taxpayers&rsquo; money to build apartments that are to be rented out for completely crazy prices from the point of view of Joe Public and citizens?  If people rent these apartments, they will never be able to save to buy a home and they will end up as pensioners in them.  I realise this is not for Ms Deering to figure out but policymakers must figure out how they will fund the system when these people reach pension age.  What kind of pension or wage will someone need to pay &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week in rent?<\/p> <p>  Based on the figures given, I am more concerned than I was after reading all this material yesterday.  We need to help small builders to provide affordable homes.  I contend that it does not cost &euro;400,000 to build or produce a home, regardless of the land cost and anything else.  There are things HBFI cannot do about the land costs that the Oireachtas should be doing, but I would like to go a lot further.  We have not acted on the Kenny report of the 1970s.  There are things we can do regarding vacant sites, CPOs, etc.  I just think we are finishing up in a worse situation than we were in given where things are heading.  I know people on relatively good incomes who are paying &euro;1,600 per month in rent.  They are absolutely crucified.  They are young couples who will never be able to buy.<\/p> <p>  I will allow in the second batch of speakers.  There are a few members who have not shown up yet.  I will allow each member who indicates a desire to contribute to do so.  However, they should bear in mind that if some of the others arrive, I will have to allow them their ten minutes.  The best thing to do is to give each member who indicates five minutes to contribute, and I will do so in the order in which members indicate.  We will then go around the houses again.

I am taking notes as this develops.  There is no requirement of proof in respect of the inability of a developer to access credit from a bank or other financial institution.  I accept that everything takes time.  Ms Deering will recall that I mentioned the very famous site in Ballsbridge.  As I recall, a party was actually held by the bank on the day that the loan was granted in principle because it had secured such a big deal.  The financial institution was over the moon that it had actually been granted that loan.  Banks are very interested in lending money for what is called real estate, or bricks and mortar, particularly in Ireland, because it is less risky than other ventures, such as manufacturing or whatever.  The asset is there and they have the deeds.  We know how it works and why it works.  For example, the deeds to my house are with somebody else because I have a mortgage on it at the moment.  No proof of the inability of a developer to access credit is required.<\/p> <p>  We have also ascertained today that there is no problem in providing funding to institutional investors.  We have established that more than 80% of the money in the momentum fund has gone into large-scale apartment development in Dublin.  Is it for institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds?  There is no barrier to the money from the HBFI going to such funds that rent out the apartments.  Ms Deering has elaborated on and explained the logic from their point of view that it is about increasing supply.  However, it is increasing the supply of overpriced houses.  We have also established that the largest loan granted was &euro;94 million, and a further loan of &euro;74 million was granted for the aptly-named Greenacres development in south Dublin for the construction of apartments.  Those two loans together are worth &euro;168 million, which is a fair chunk of the cash that is available.  We have also established that up to that point at the end of 2020, loans had only been granted for up to 41 homes to be provided by small builders in developments of ten or less.  The points I wish to emphasise are no requirement of proof of inability to access credit, no barrier to cuckoo funds, large loans are being granted to institutional developers and the affordability issue.  Local authorities build very high-quality homes.  I refer to &Oacute; Cualann housing association.  Granted, it has free land.  I understand that, but the land still does not make up that fraction, where we are heading towards nearly three times the cost from the figures HBFI provided.  The loans, particularly from the momentum fund, are being granted to large developers in Dublin that provide overpriced apartment blocks to let.  <\/p> <p>  I thank HBFI for the briefing it submitted to the committee in advance of the meeting.  It contains good information that is set out in a very concise way.  When I read the briefing, I was shocked to learn about the bond situation.  I refer to the case where a developer goes to a local authority to build 100 houses or apartments.  The local authority will look for a bond, typically so much per unit, to ensure the development is finished, and the roads are put in and the sewerage water, public lighting, footpaths and everything else is finished off to a proper standard.  I am referring to everything within the public domain, out past the front door to where the development meets a public road.  In the HBFI briefing, with regard to bonds failing, it is stated: \"The report noted that although difficulties have been highlighted on specific developments it was not considered to be a widespread practice.\"  I was a county councillor before I became a Deputy.  Like those who came behind me, I am still following up on estates that I was chasing up more than 20 years ago with developers in relation to bonds failing, bonds not being renewed, bonds not being rolled over and bonds that were not worth the paper they were written on.  Some local authorities are now only accepting cash bonds.  To my mind, it should always have been that way.  I have stood on estates, as I am sure other public representatives have, that have been left in disastrous state.  They looked like Syria.  I have seen manholes and sewers left open, no public lighting, no footpaths and no surfaces on the roads.  On one estate, the developer did not even bother to put in the road.  I am talking about awful outcomes.  Local authorities had to go in and finish these estates.  We had to argue in the D&aacute;il for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to provide money just to address the safety issues on estates following the crash, which, in fairness, it did.  That is still a problem.  We had the insanity of the Celtic tiger, the hangover from it and the mopping-up exercise that followed.  That mopping-up exercise continues today.  A little more care has been taken with recent developments.  However, I am concerned about the assertion that it is not considered to be a widespread practice.  I am concerned about the fact that we are providing public money to entities, including investors, small and large developers, with no guarantee that when the estates they are developing or the projects they are working on are finished, the local authorities will not have to find money or go begging to the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications, or that we will have to stand up and argue in the House with the Minister for Finance, looking for money for them.  The State has had to intervene a lot.  Local authorities have had to intervene.  They have had to use of money that was designated for other purposes.  Local authorities are not cash-rich generally.  I ask HBFI to review that.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Deering mentioned earlier that the fund has been closed.  If there is going to be any future funding for anything like this, the bonds issue has to be nailed down.  We had a discussion on it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I raised the issue, in particular, but other Deputies are interested in it as well, in fairness.  We are concerned about the failure to have proper bonds in place.  I am not just referring to pieces of paper; I am talking about putting proper bonds in place, so that if the developer fails, the local authority can get its hands on the cash.  It is the enforcement authority.  It is left to deal with the issue.  County councillors around the country have to take the flack from the public.  The public ask them why permission for developments was granted and why bonds were not adequate.  I can take the witnesses to estates in Mountmellick, Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory.   There are estates all over the place.  Members can rattle off examples of estates that were not finished properly and where there are still issues to be addressed.  For example, the sewerage pumping station in Woodgrove, Portlaoise, close to where I live, is still not adequate.  In the real world, beyond the gates of this place, the issue of bonds has to be nailed down if any further finance is going to be provided or before any other loan is granted using public money.  I would say the same thing about granting private money, but I make the point particularly in respect of granting public money.  Through the issues that we have fleshed out this morning, we know that there is no requirement of proof of the inability to access credit.  If I apply for a local authority loan, I have to be able to show that I cannot get the finance elsewhere.  This money is available to institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds.  The stated aim in the first place of providing finance to small builders has not worked out.  Now we find that the bond issue is not watertight.  That is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#P00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I am happy to come back to the committee on the bond issue.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.<\/p> <p>  No. 1079 PAC33 is correspondence from the Government accounting unit, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 February 2022.  It encloses the minute of the Minister in relation to the committee&rsquo;s reports on our examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These are important items of correspondence as they are the formal responses to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and to hold it over for further consideration today.  It has been flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.<\/p> <p>  This correspondence relates to the independent building standards regulator about which we made a recommendation.  Our recommendation related to the impact the pyrite remediation scheme and defective concrete blocks grant scheme would have on the Exchequer.  On page 3 of the response, it states, \"However, it should be noted that any decision regarding the establishment of an independent building standards regulator will be a matter for Government and is likely to require primary legislation\".  I believe we should be getting something more concrete - pardon the pun - than that.  It is either does or it does not.  What would be the timeline for that?  We could have done with a building standards regulator 50 year ago, never mind in recent times.  One can see the significant exposure that exists by not dealing with those kinds of issues and preventing them from occurring.  It becomes financially very expensive.  This is very important and we should follow up on it.<\/p> <p>  Page 4 states, \"As part of the Building Control Reform Agenda the National Building Control Management Project was created to provide oversight\".  I am not entirely sure what the purpose of that role is.  Is it responsible for the regulation of building and construction products?  Can we establish what the full remit of that project is?  This may be a matter we can come back to.  The first page states, \"current expenditure on HAP and RAS is demand led\".  That may well be an matter we will come back to in the context of budgets.<\/p><p>If we are going to have a sizeable influx of people from Ukraine, I imagine those budgets will need some additional funds.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#GG01600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646299800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Deputy Brian Stanley resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Next is No. 1084 B from Ms Cl&iacute;odhna Guy, interim CEO, Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, dated 17 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding the installation of CCTV cameras at 25 racecourses.

Okay.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 1092B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 21 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding payments under the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Secretary General states that the legislation provides that while the Department funds the schemes, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners administers it.  As the Minister for Finance brought forward the legislation, any policy decisions in relation to it are a matter for the Minister and the board of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  We have also received related correspondence from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, R1096 PAC33, and from the Department of Finance, R1105 PAC33.  Revenue states that companies making distributions, including but not exclusive to dividends to shareholders, have obligations to deduct and return dividend withholding tax, DWT.  Regarding analysis, Revenue states that DWT returns filed by companies claiming EWSS, in respect of distributions made in 2021, showed that 641 employers filed DWT returns, out of a total of 51,900 who received EWSS payments.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance has provided a detailed response outlining some of the difficulties in legislating to link and prevent the payment of any dividends to shareholders that might be based on State supports.  For example, a dividend could be deferred until the company is no longer in receipt of such supports.  The Department also refers to an interdepartmental review of Covid-19 emergency income supports, and I would propose that we request a copy of the findings of that review. <\/p> <p>  I propose to note and publish this item, request a copy of that review, and also to forward copies of the three items of correspondence to Deputy Nash, who raised this matter with the committee.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I flagged this correspondence for discussion.  We must question a few points with the Department.  The letter we received stated that Ireland had set an ambitious target to have 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.  I suggest that we need to reply and ask how that figure was arrived at.  Judging by the number of EVs on the road now, which is a fraction of that target figure, we are looking at a requirement to add well over 100,000 EVs every year until 2030, but the total number of new cars sold each year hardly reaches that figure.  Considering that EVs are also much more expensive, how realistic is that target of having 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030?   I suggest we should raise this aspect with the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, to see where that figure is coming from and what it is based on.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue, and one I have raised before, is that approved battery electric vehicles, BEVs, with a listed price of less than &euro;14,000 will not receive a grant.  There is also a cap of &euro;60,000 on the purchase price of all vehicles.  We should perhaps raise a concern about the cap being so high.  While EVs are more expensive, it is possible to buy them for &euro;40,000 or less.  I note that the correspondence we received in response contained a list of the type of vehicles being bought under the grant scheme.<\/p><p>BMWs loom very large in it and there are some Jaguars and Land Rovers which are hugely heavy vehicles.  There are also loads of Mercedes.  In corresponding with the Department we must ask, in the context of the use of public money, if any consideration has been given to reducing that subsidy.  I do not wish to sound in any way anti those people within the commuter belt, but from the figures we have seen previously it appears that a lot of these cars are bought within the general Dublin area.  People who live further away are, by and large, not buying into electric vehicles because of range anxiety.  Do we have a situation here where people in rural areas are perhaps subsidising huge electric vehicles in the greater Dublin area?  Has the Department given, or is it giving, any consideration to reducing that subsidy limit to under &euro;60,000?  It seems very high.  Would any other member wish to come in on this?  No.<\/p><p> No. 1098B from Mr. John Dollard, Chief Superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 18 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement, including steps being taken to ensure that the operational needs on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are met within procurement rules and guidelines.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that we are scheduled to examine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s appropriation account on 31 March so please let the clerk know if there are any specific issues or areas of interest on which members wish to receive briefing information in advance of the meeting.  This was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to come in?  No.  I take it he is okay with this.

The railway order for DART+ is for the Maynooth line and the Kildare line.  They are in a process.  One of the issues I raised with the NTA was the prospect of a parallel process for some additional extensions.  The argument made by the NTA is that if we were to go back to the beginning the process would be delayed.  There is no reason, however, that there could not be a separate process to add on some additional projects.  The DART+ south west project, for example, stops at Hazelhatch.  There is absolutely no reason why it could not go to Sallins or even to Newbridge, whether or not they have done any work in advancing that.  On the other line, it could go from Maynooth to Kilcock, at the very least.  The Dart+ West project is going to include the construction of eight large railway sheds in Kilcock.  Essentially, the Dart will be going to Kilcock and the only problem is that people would not be able to get on.  It seems like a daft idea that we would not be picking that low-hanging fruit.  There is not a whole lot in the way between Hazelhatch and Sallins and perhaps this could be asked for.  Since Covid, if one is listening to the traffic reports in the morning one is far more likely to hear about congestion on the periphery.  There has been a more dramatic change there with regard to delays.  It strikes me that these are projects that could be bolted onto those two DART+ projects.  We should be asking the NTA what work it has done to advance them so they could happen in parallel, albeit with a separate process.  We were speaking about electric cars.  The best way to move people around is on public transport, if that could be made available with more frequent services and so on, which would go with the DART+ projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Five tonnes of steel should not be necessary every time one wants to go somewhere.

This is in the context of some issues that have been raised recently.<\/p> <p>  The week after that, 17 March, is a non-sitting week.<\/p> <p>  We have requested confirmation from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that it will appear before the committee on 24 March.  This has been confirmed.<\/p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings.  The following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April; and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.<\/p> <p>  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter which means the next meeting will be on 27 April with the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>That is our last confirmed meeting.  We then look to engage with University of Limerick, UL, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after Easter.  We may also schedule a meeting with the Department of Health and HSE to address a number of issues that are in the public domain and which we may want to discuss with them.<\/p><p> Are there any other matters related to our work programme that members wish to raise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#JJ00700","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>On UL, it has been reported that report is further delayed and may well be subject to some legal scrutiny.

There is nothing else members wish to raise.  That concludes our consideration of the work programme for today.  Our meeting next week will be an engagement with the HSE on its 2020 financial statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#KK00500","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646299800,"counter":578,"content":"<p>The committee adjourned at 3.12 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 March 2022.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
