In accordance with public health guidelines, the wearing of face coverings is optional for members and witnesses.<\/p> <p>  Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Mr. Brian Hill, audit manager.<\/p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, to examine its 2020 financial statements.  The committee has advised the HBFI that it may also wish to examine the issuance of bonds and unfinished estates during the engagement.

As they are within the precincts of the Parliament, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue and it is imperative that they comply with such directions.<\/p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.

It operates as a commercial State entity, providing finance at market rates for commercially-viable residential developments.<\/p> <p>  HBFI was incorporated as a designated activity company in December 2018 and the company&rsquo;s share capital is owned solely by the Minister for Finance.  A group entity, Home Building Finance Ireland (Lending) Designated Activity Company, was subsequently incorporated in early January 2019 and it is a 100%-owned subsidiary of HBFI.  The operations of HBFI commenced on 28 January 2019, with access to an initial loan fund of &euro;730 million to be made available by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, on the direction of the Minister for Finance.  At the time of its launch, HBFI&rsquo;s initial loan product was targeted at small- and medium-sized builders and was limited to providing senior debt funding for residential projects of ten units or more, up to a maximum of &euro;35 million per project.<\/p> <p>  During 2020, HBFI significantly expanded the scope of its lending.  It now offers funding for projects to build apartments where lending of up to &euro;75 million can be provided; for small residential development projects of fewer than ten units; for social housing projects contracted for sale to a local authority or an approved housing body, AHB; and a &euro;300 million momentum fund, which was launched as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic to provide funding to established developers for larger-scale developments in prime locations. <\/p> <p>  Naturally, HBFI was still in the initial stages of scaling up its operation in 2020.  From the date of inception up until the end of 2020, HBFI had approved offers of loans totalling &euro;395 million, but significantly less funding had been drawn down by borrowers.  As the statement of financial position discloses, HBFI had loans in issue by the end of 2020 to developers of just under &euro;37 million, and HBFI had borrowed a total of &euro;37.3 million from the ISIF to facilitate this lending.<\/p> <p>  HBFI&rsquo;s operating expenses in 2020 amounted to almost &euro;5.7 million, of which &euro;2.6 million was paid in respect of salaries to HBFI staff.  Members may wish to note that HBFI staff are employees of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, seconded to HBFI.  The NTMA also provides administration supports to HBFI, including premises, HR functions, procurement and financial management services.  Income earned by HBFI in 2020 amounted to &euro;864,000.  This included net interest income of &euro;544,000 and other income of &euro;320,000.  HBFI incurred a loss of just under &euro;4.8 million for 2020.<\/p> <p>  I issued unqualified audit opinions on the 2020 financial statements of the HBFI group, and of the subsidiary company. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Ms Deering is very welcome.

I am joined by my colleagues, whom the Chair has already introduced.<\/p> <p>  HBFI is a Government initiative to increase the supply of new homes, for owner-occupiers, renters and social housing, by providing loans on commercial terms to small, medium and large housebuilders for commercially-viable developments throughout Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Last month, we published a performance update that showed we had grown total loan approvals to &euro;835 million as at the end of December 2021.  The funding we have approved can deliver 3,729 new homes in 71 developments in 18 counties.  Drawdowns have already taken place in respect of 57% of the facilities we had approved at the end of December.  This shows that the houses and apartments being built with HBFI funding are being completed quickly, thereby meeting some of the immense demand for housing.  Furthermore, I am pleased to say that our strong progress has continued into 2022, with the result that, as of the end February, our total loan approvals have grown to more than &euro;1 billion.  These will support the potential delivery of over 4,400 new homes across 20 counties.<\/p> <p>  HBFI funding has been effective for several reasons.  By listening to our stakeholders and focusing on developments where housebuilders experience difficulty raising funding from traditional sources, HBFI addresses the gaps in the traditional marketplace and provides a rigorous but fast loan approval process.  Our focus on supporting incremental housing supply gives us a flexibility that may not always be available from mainstream banks.  Equally, while mainstream banks often gravitate towards urban areas, we have a national remit to try to support new home supply in every county and not just the big cities.<\/p><p>Our product range will take into account the market reality that some housing schemes will simply be too small for other lenders to support.  Through our strong stakeholder engagement across the public and private sectors, the HBFI can identify trends and gaps in the funding market from the ground up.<\/p><p> However, not all the challenges can be predicted, as the Covid pandemic has demonstrated.  The HBFI&rsquo;s ability to respond to the risk that there may be further, albeit temporary, challenges as a result of Covid-19 impacting on the timing of future supply brought about the creation of the momentum fund.  As the initial &euro;200 million was fully committed within three months, the strength of demand resulted in the HBFI adding a further &euro;100 million to the fund.  The success of the fund has continued to the extent that it is now more than 90% utilised and the time is right to close it to new applications.  The momentum fund is just one example of how the HBFI&rsquo;s agile business model can respond to disruptions to residential development finance and tailor its offerings to the areas where demand exists the most.<\/p><p> In reality, the HBFI is just one part of the solution to the supply-demand imbalance that exists, which is causing so much difficulty for owner-occupiers, renters and those in need of social housing.  We feel strongly that increasing supply across the market is beneficial for everyone.  By funding developments aimed at owner-occupiers, we are helping these people move out of the rental sector and freeing up homes for other renters, thereby increasing the supply in that sector.  By funding new homes for rental, we build on that progress, increase the choice available to renters and try to help alleviate some of the pricing pressure existing in that market.<\/p><p> Access to development finance for all types of housing remains a key issue for homebuilders and is vital to support the continued delivery of housing throughout the State.  Through the strategies I have outlined today, the HBFI seeks to address the financing challenge and ensure that finance is available where the level of demand makes a development viable.  We take great pride in being part of each of the developments we finance and in seeing foundations being dug and diggers at work.  That is what the HBFI is all about; turning the finance we have available into homes.<\/p><p> This concludes my opening remarks.  I hope this has given the committee a better understanding of the work of the HBFI.  My colleagues and I will do our best to answer any questions members may have. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#A00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":13,"content":"<p>The first member to speak is Deputy McAuliffe who has 15 minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00200","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Deering for her statement and the Comptroller and Auditor General for his reports.  I do not want to paraphrase what Ms Deering said, but I will focus on one line where she said the HBFI identified gaps in the existing fund available to creditors and did so in an efficient and rigorous way.  I am thinking back to the development of the HBFI.  In many ways, many of the new policy tools that have come in, such as Housing for All and so on, have increased the number of policy tools available to tackle the housing market.  While all homes built are very important and help to solve the housing crisis - as Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage I am very conscious of that - the role of members of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hold the HBFI to account for the policy area under its remit.<\/p> <p>  I will focus on the idea of small and medium-sized builders and the access they have to credit.  Would the representatives say that was the core origin of the creation of the HBFI?  It certainly seems to have comprised much of the early work of the organisation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00300","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":15,"content":"<p>The Deputy is absolutely right.  When the HBFI was established, the initial assumption was that finance would be more concerned with small and medium-sized developers or housebuilders, especially outside urban areas.  We see that as a real gap.  In fact, 65% of all the homes we have funded are in schemes that are being built with fewer than 50 homes.  That is a reality.  Some 63% of all the homes we have funded are outside the Dublin area.  Both those factors are clear evidence that there is less availability of finance and, therefore, more demand outside the main areas.<\/p> <p>  One of the things we did very early was a strategic review and a large piece of market research.  We identified gaps even beyond that.  If we look at small housing schemes, when the HBFI was initially set up, the assumption was the demand would be in units greater than ten.  Actually, 14% of all housing supply in Ireland over the past number of years is in schemes of fewer than ten units.  We brought out a product specifically to support housebuilders who want to build between five and ten units to try to fill that gap further.  Equally, on the other side of the spectrum, we saw real challenges with apartment delivery and the financing of apartment delivery schemes so we brought out a product specifically for that.  That was the message I was trying to get across in my opening statement.  There is not one housing market; there are multiple markets.  There are multiple challenges facing those markets and we have tried to respond to the gaps as they emerge. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I want to focus on the HBFI's move away from focusing on that idea of small to medium sized towards the momentum fund, which I will discuss.

I see it as an add-on to what we were doing because those gaps very much existed in small and medium-sized scheme funding.  As I said, 65% of all the schemes are fewer than 50 units.  That is a very important focus for us.  We went a step further than the original offering by bringing out a product for those smaller schemes.  It is very important for us.<\/p> <p>  I believe that in our role as a funder, and our mandate is to increase supply, we have to recognise that the gaps will be at different parts of the market and sometimes that will be timebound.  The Deputy may want to reference the momentum fund, which is a prime example of something that was created as a result of the pandemic.  Our role was to step in and respond to that factor. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":18,"content":"<p>Okay.  I will come back to that.  Clearly, the HBFI has not seen the success in drawdowns for those smaller projects that it might have.  Of almost &euro;395 million approved facilities, the drawdown has just been approximately &euro;37 million, which is 10%.  I am trying to get to the bottom of why that is happening in the market so I can understand it from a policy perspective.

The Deputy is right that there is obviously a gap between the &euro;395 million that was there to the end of 2020 and the drawdowns at that point.  That is the same irrespective of any housing scheme we fund because it will take a period of time.  First, from the time we approve the fund, it takes about three to six months on average before funding is drawn down.  The whole nature of development finance is we only lend the money as the activity is happening.  It will take a further 21 months on average before the full amount of money we propose for a scheme is drawn down.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00800","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>As the HBFI heads into year three, was 10% of total approvals a target it hoped to exceed?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B00900","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":21,"content":"<p>Is that in terms of drawdowns?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B01000","nonspeaker":"Ms Dara Deering"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":22,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#B01100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":23,"content":"<p>The reality is the construction programmes we approved in, for example, the early part of 2020, have not yet delivered to schedule.

That is not the quickest or most efficient use of the funding we have available.  The reality is that from the time we approve a facility, a number of things have to happen.  First, there is a due diligence process to make sure all the checks and balances are in place because we are lending State money but on the other side of it, the housebuilders have to mobilise the resources available, including the labour and materials, to get on site.

I can see how an organisation that is struggling to get the volume it wants can very easily come up with a new tool, allocate more than 40% of the funds and start to then reach volumes that could be met by other financial institutions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#C01100","speaker":"1568"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I will deal specifically with the momentum fund and then I will come back to one of the Deputy's other points.

I am aware that Ms Deering made the case earlier that she was trying to help that sector as well.  However, are we sure that sector was really struggling to get finance?  For example, if a constituent went to the local authority tomorrow to get money under the local authority loan scheme or, previously, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, two letters from private financial institutions would have to be produced stating he or she could not get a loan.  There would also be other rigorous checks.  Ms Deering clarified that the developers who finished up with 80% of the public money did not have to produce any of that documentation.  Does she not find that odd?  She mentioned that her organisation did not want to put the applicants through the rigorous process of going around the houses looking for money before coming back to it, but that does not take long.  One can get the information from a bank or other financial institution in a day.  If a developer or builder presents balanced books to a bank or financial institution and shows evidence of the asset, secured land, planning permission and a preliminary design that has been done, he or she will get a fairly quick answer within a week; it does not take months.<\/p> <p>  A weakness in the momentum fund and the overall scheme is that critical check is not in place.  What happened is simply that, in the case of the fund, more than 80% of it ended up funding apartments in Dublin that finished up in the hands of private developers charging a rent of &euro;3,100 per month.  That is crazy money by comparison with rents in other European cities.  Before the crash, we finished up with the most expensive site in the world in Ballsbridge.  We all remember that and what happened.  Some of the people involved wound up in America.  We remember the madness of all that.  Are we not driving ourselves into a crazy situation again using taxpayers&rsquo; money to build apartments that are to be rented out for completely crazy prices from the point of view of Joe Public and citizens?  If people rent these apartments, they will never be able to save to buy a home and they will end up as pensioners in them.  I realise this is not for Ms Deering to figure out but policymakers must figure out how they will fund the system when these people reach pension age.  What kind of pension or wage will someone need to pay &euro;700 or &euro;800 per week in rent?<\/p> <p>  Based on the figures given, I am more concerned than I was after reading all this material yesterday.  We need to help small builders to provide affordable homes.  I contend that it does not cost &euro;400,000 to build or produce a home, regardless of the land cost and anything else.  There are things HBFI cannot do about the land costs that the Oireachtas should be doing, but I would like to go a lot further.  We have not acted on the Kenny report of the 1970s.  There are things we can do regarding vacant sites, CPOs, etc.  I just think we are finishing up in a worse situation than we were in given where things are heading.  I know people on relatively good incomes who are paying &euro;1,600 per month in rent.  They are absolutely crucified.  They are young couples who will never be able to buy.<\/p> <p>  I will allow in the second batch of speakers.  There are a few members who have not shown up yet.  I will allow each member who indicates a desire to contribute to do so.  However, they should bear in mind that if some of the others arrive, I will have to allow them their ten minutes.  The best thing to do is to give each member who indicates five minutes to contribute, and I will do so in the order in which members indicate.  We will then go around the houses again.

I am taking notes as this develops.  There is no requirement of proof in respect of the inability of a developer to access credit from a bank or other financial institution.  I accept that everything takes time.  Ms Deering will recall that I mentioned the very famous site in Ballsbridge.  As I recall, a party was actually held by the bank on the day that the loan was granted in principle because it had secured such a big deal.  The financial institution was over the moon that it had actually been granted that loan.  Banks are very interested in lending money for what is called real estate, or bricks and mortar, particularly in Ireland, because it is less risky than other ventures, such as manufacturing or whatever.  The asset is there and they have the deeds.  We know how it works and why it works.  For example, the deeds to my house are with somebody else because I have a mortgage on it at the moment.  No proof of the inability of a developer to access credit is required.<\/p> <p>  We have also ascertained today that there is no problem in providing funding to institutional investors.  We have established that more than 80% of the money in the momentum fund has gone into large-scale apartment development in Dublin.  Is it for institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds?  There is no barrier to the money from the HBFI going to such funds that rent out the apartments.  Ms Deering has elaborated on and explained the logic from their point of view that it is about increasing supply.  However, it is increasing the supply of overpriced houses.  We have also established that the largest loan granted was &euro;94 million, and a further loan of &euro;74 million was granted for the aptly-named Greenacres development in south Dublin for the construction of apartments.  Those two loans together are worth &euro;168 million, which is a fair chunk of the cash that is available.  We have also established that up to that point at the end of 2020, loans had only been granted for up to 41 homes to be provided by small builders in developments of ten or less.  The points I wish to emphasise are no requirement of proof of inability to access credit, no barrier to cuckoo funds, large loans are being granted to institutional developers and the affordability issue.  Local authorities build very high-quality homes.  I refer to &Oacute; Cualann housing association.  Granted, it has free land.  I understand that, but the land still does not make up that fraction, where we are heading towards nearly three times the cost from the figures HBFI provided.  The loans, particularly from the momentum fund, are being granted to large developers in Dublin that provide overpriced apartment blocks to let.  <\/p> <p>  I thank HBFI for the briefing it submitted to the committee in advance of the meeting.  It contains good information that is set out in a very concise way.  When I read the briefing, I was shocked to learn about the bond situation.  I refer to the case where a developer goes to a local authority to build 100 houses or apartments.  The local authority will look for a bond, typically so much per unit, to ensure the development is finished, and the roads are put in and the sewerage water, public lighting, footpaths and everything else is finished off to a proper standard.  I am referring to everything within the public domain, out past the front door to where the development meets a public road.  In the HBFI briefing, with regard to bonds failing, it is stated: \"The report noted that although difficulties have been highlighted on specific developments it was not considered to be a widespread practice.\"  I was a county councillor before I became a Deputy.  Like those who came behind me, I am still following up on estates that I was chasing up more than 20 years ago with developers in relation to bonds failing, bonds not being renewed, bonds not being rolled over and bonds that were not worth the paper they were written on.  Some local authorities are now only accepting cash bonds.  To my mind, it should always have been that way.  I have stood on estates, as I am sure other public representatives have, that have been left in disastrous state.  They looked like Syria.  I have seen manholes and sewers left open, no public lighting, no footpaths and no surfaces on the roads.  On one estate, the developer did not even bother to put in the road.  I am talking about awful outcomes.  Local authorities had to go in and finish these estates.  We had to argue in the D&aacute;il for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications to provide money just to address the safety issues on estates following the crash, which, in fairness, it did.  That is still a problem.  We had the insanity of the Celtic tiger, the hangover from it and the mopping-up exercise that followed.  That mopping-up exercise continues today.  A little more care has been taken with recent developments.  However, I am concerned about the assertion that it is not considered to be a widespread practice.  I am concerned about the fact that we are providing public money to entities, including investors, small and large developers, with no guarantee that when the estates they are developing or the projects they are working on are finished, the local authorities will not have to find money or go begging to the Department for the Environment, Climate and Communications, or that we will have to stand up and argue in the House with the Minister for Finance, looking for money for them.  The State has had to intervene a lot.  Local authorities have had to intervene.  They have had to use of money that was designated for other purposes.  Local authorities are not cash-rich generally.  I ask HBFI to review that.  <\/p> <p>  Ms Deering mentioned earlier that the fund has been closed.  If there is going to be any future funding for anything like this, the bonds issue has to be nailed down.  We had a discussion on it.  Deputy Catherine Murphy and I raised the issue, in particular, but other Deputies are interested in it as well, in fairness.  We are concerned about the failure to have proper bonds in place.  I am not just referring to pieces of paper; I am talking about putting proper bonds in place, so that if the developer fails, the local authority can get its hands on the cash.  It is the enforcement authority.  It is left to deal with the issue.  County councillors around the country have to take the flack from the public.  The public ask them why permission for developments was granted and why bonds were not adequate.  I can take the witnesses to estates in Mountmellick, Portlaoise and Borris-in-Ossory.   There are estates all over the place.  Members can rattle off examples of estates that were not finished properly and where there are still issues to be addressed.  For example, the sewerage pumping station in Woodgrove, Portlaoise, close to where I live, is still not adequate.  In the real world, beyond the gates of this place, the issue of bonds has to be nailed down if any further finance is going to be provided or before any other loan is granted using public money.  I would say the same thing about granting private money, but I make the point particularly in respect of granting public money.  Through the issues that we have fleshed out this morning, we know that there is no requirement of proof of the inability to access credit.  If I apply for a local authority loan, I have to be able to show that I cannot get the finance elsewhere.  This money is available to institutional investors, which are sometimes referred to as cuckoo funds.  The stated aim in the first place of providing finance to small builders has not worked out.  Now we find that the bond issue is not watertight.  That is not good enough.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#P00100","speaker":"1491"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646299800,"counter":442,"content":"<p>I am happy to come back to the committee on the bond issue.

The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings.<\/p> <p>  No. 1079 PAC33 is correspondence from the Government accounting unit, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 16 February 2022.  It encloses the minute of the Minister in relation to the committee&rsquo;s reports on our examination of the 2019 appropriation accounts of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These are important items of correspondence as they are the formal responses to the committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item and to hold it over for further consideration today.  It has been flagged for discussion by Deputy Carthy.<\/p> <p>  This correspondence relates to the independent building standards regulator about which we made a recommendation.  Our recommendation related to the impact the pyrite remediation scheme and defective concrete blocks grant scheme would have on the Exchequer.  On page 3 of the response, it states, \"However, it should be noted that any decision regarding the establishment of an independent building standards regulator will be a matter for Government and is likely to require primary legislation\".  I believe we should be getting something more concrete - pardon the pun - than that.  It is either does or it does not.  What would be the timeline for that?  We could have done with a building standards regulator 50 year ago, never mind in recent times.  One can see the significant exposure that exists by not dealing with those kinds of issues and preventing them from occurring.  It becomes financially very expensive.  This is very important and we should follow up on it.<\/p> <p>  Page 4 states, \"As part of the Building Control Reform Agenda the National Building Control Management Project was created to provide oversight\".  I am not entirely sure what the purpose of that role is.  Is it responsible for the regulation of building and construction products?  Can we establish what the full remit of that project is?  This may be a matter we can come back to.  The first page states, \"current expenditure on HAP and RAS is demand led\".  That may well be an matter we will come back to in the context of budgets.<\/p><p>If we are going to have a sizeable influx of people from Ukraine, I imagine those budgets will need some additional funds.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#GG01600","speaker":"1489","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646299800,"counter":554,"content":"<p>Deputy Brian Stanley resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":555,"content":"<p>Next is No. 1084 B from Ms Cl&iacute;odhna Guy, interim CEO, Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, dated 17 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding the installation of CCTV cameras at 25 racecourses.

Okay.<\/p> <p>  Next is No. 1092B from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Social Protection, dated 21 February 2022 providing information requested by the committee regarding payments under the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The Secretary General states that the legislation provides that while the Department funds the schemes, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners administers it.  As the Minister for Finance brought forward the legislation, any policy decisions in relation to it are a matter for the Minister and the board of the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p> <p>  We have also received related correspondence from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, R1096 PAC33, and from the Department of Finance, R1105 PAC33.  Revenue states that companies making distributions, including but not exclusive to dividends to shareholders, have obligations to deduct and return dividend withholding tax, DWT.  Regarding analysis, Revenue states that DWT returns filed by companies claiming EWSS, in respect of distributions made in 2021, showed that 641 employers filed DWT returns, out of a total of 51,900 who received EWSS payments.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Finance has provided a detailed response outlining some of the difficulties in legislating to link and prevent the payment of any dividends to shareholders that might be based on State supports.  For example, a dividend could be deferred until the company is no longer in receipt of such supports.  The Department also refers to an interdepartmental review of Covid-19 emergency income supports, and I would propose that we request a copy of the findings of that review. <\/p> <p>  I propose to note and publish this item, request a copy of that review, and also to forward copies of the three items of correspondence to Deputy Nash, who raised this matter with the committee.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p> <p>  I flagged this correspondence for discussion.  We must question a few points with the Department.  The letter we received stated that Ireland had set an ambitious target to have 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030.  I suggest that we need to reply and ask how that figure was arrived at.  Judging by the number of EVs on the road now, which is a fraction of that target figure, we are looking at a requirement to add well over 100,000 EVs every year until 2030, but the total number of new cars sold each year hardly reaches that figure.  Considering that EVs are also much more expensive, how realistic is that target of having 945,000 EVs on our roads by 2030?   I suggest we should raise this aspect with the Secretary General, Mr. Spratt, to see where that figure is coming from and what it is based on.  <\/p> <p>  Another issue, and one I have raised before, is that approved battery electric vehicles, BEVs, with a listed price of less than &euro;14,000 will not receive a grant.  There is also a cap of &euro;60,000 on the purchase price of all vehicles.  We should perhaps raise a concern about the cap being so high.  While EVs are more expensive, it is possible to buy them for &euro;40,000 or less.  I note that the correspondence we received in response contained a list of the type of vehicles being bought under the grant scheme.<\/p><p>BMWs loom very large in it and there are some Jaguars and Land Rovers which are hugely heavy vehicles.  There are also loads of Mercedes.  In corresponding with the Department we must ask, in the context of the use of public money, if any consideration has been given to reducing that subsidy.  I do not wish to sound in any way anti those people within the commuter belt, but from the figures we have seen previously it appears that a lot of these cars are bought within the general Dublin area.  People who live further away are, by and large, not buying into electric vehicles because of range anxiety.  Do we have a situation here where people in rural areas are perhaps subsidising huge electric vehicles in the greater Dublin area?  Has the Department given, or is it giving, any consideration to reducing that subsidy limit to under &euro;60,000?  It seems very high.  Would any other member wish to come in on this?  No.<\/p><p> No. 1098B from Mr. John Dollard, Chief Superintendent, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, dated 18 February 2022 provides information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement, including steps being taken to ensure that the operational needs on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are met within procurement rules and guidelines.  It is proposed to note and publish this item.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<\/p><p> Members will be aware that we are scheduled to examine An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s appropriation account on 31 March so please let the clerk know if there are any specific issues or areas of interest on which members wish to receive briefing information in advance of the meeting.  This was flagged for discussion by Deputy Matt Carthy.  Does Deputy Carthy wish to come in?  No.  I take it he is okay with this.

The railway order for DART+ is for the Maynooth line and the Kildare line.  They are in a process.  One of the issues I raised with the NTA was the prospect of a parallel process for some additional extensions.  The argument made by the NTA is that if we were to go back to the beginning the process would be delayed.  There is no reason, however, that there could not be a separate process to add on some additional projects.  The DART+ south west project, for example, stops at Hazelhatch.  There is absolutely no reason why it could not go to Sallins or even to Newbridge, whether or not they have done any work in advancing that.  On the other line, it could go from Maynooth to Kilcock, at the very least.  The Dart+ West project is going to include the construction of eight large railway sheds in Kilcock.  Essentially, the Dart will be going to Kilcock and the only problem is that people would not be able to get on.  It seems like a daft idea that we would not be picking that low-hanging fruit.  There is not a whole lot in the way between Hazelhatch and Sallins and perhaps this could be asked for.  Since Covid, if one is listening to the traffic reports in the morning one is far more likely to hear about congestion on the periphery.  There has been a more dramatic change there with regard to delays.  It strikes me that these are projects that could be bolted onto those two DART+ projects.  We should be asking the NTA what work it has done to advance them so they could happen in parallel, albeit with a separate process.  We were speaking about electric cars.  The best way to move people around is on public transport, if that could be made available with more frequent services and so on, which would go with the DART+ projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#JJ00200","speaker":"1489"},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":568,"content":"<p>Five tonnes of steel should not be necessary every time one wants to go somewhere.

This is in the context of some issues that have been raised recently.<\/p> <p>  The week after that, 17 March, is a non-sitting week.<\/p> <p>  We have requested confirmation from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland that it will appear before the committee on 24 March.  This has been confirmed.<\/p> <p>  On 31 March, we will commence a series of justice-related meetings.  The following engagements have been confirmed: An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on 31 March; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission for the morning of 7 April; and the Policing Authority for the afternoon of 7 April.<\/p> <p>  There are then two non-sitting weeks scheduled for Easter which means the next meeting will be on 27 April with the Department of Justice.<\/p><p>That is our last confirmed meeting.  We then look to engage with University of Limerick, UL, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform after Easter.  We may also schedule a meeting with the Department of Health and HSE to address a number of issues that are in the public domain and which we may want to discuss with them.<\/p><p> Are there any other matters related to our work programme that members wish to raise?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2022030300002#JJ00700","speaker":"1491","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646299800,"counter":574,"content":"<p>On UL, it has been reported that report is further delayed and may well be subject to some legal scrutiny.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome Mr. Schmit this morning.  Prior to his appointment as EU Commissioner in 2019, Mr. Schmit was Minister of Labour, Employment and Social and Solidarity Economy in Luxembourg from 2013.  Prior to that, he served as Minister of Labour, Employment and Immigration from 2009.  As issues relating to jobs and social rights in Ireland are, of course, greatly influenced by policy and legislation at EU level, it is particularly important that both the Commissioner and the committee are acquainted with each other's perspectives and concerns.<\/p> <p>  To commence our discussion today, I now invite Commissioner Schmit to make some opening remarks on issues of mutual interest.  They may well include issues relating to teleworking and the right to disconnect, labour shortages, occupational safety and health and the European Commission's approach to platform work.  The floor is his.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#D00200","speaker":"1509"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646265600,"counter":583,"content":"<p>I thank the honourable Chairman and members and wish everybody a good morning.  It is a real honour for me to address this chamber on my first visit to Ireland as European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights.  I am very grateful for the invitation to speak today at the committee and to be able to have an exchange of views on a number of topics that are of high importance both to the European Commission, European Union and certainly also to Ireland.<\/p> <p>  I am very impressed by the work the committee is doing.  Despite its short lifespan, this committee has already made a significant contribution to improving the Irish labour market and economy.  The pre-legislative scrutiny it carried out on the Right to Request Remote Work Bill 2021, for example, and its tireless work on the scrutiny of European Union legislative proposals, including those that have emerged from the European Pillar of Social Rights, are to be commended.<\/p> <p>  The European Commission is committed to building a strong social Europe that protects.  This is the foundation of all the initiatives that we are proposing.  Every action we take comes under the umbrella of the European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan, which we presented almost exactly one year ago today in Porto on 4 March 2022 during the European Summit.<\/p> <p>  As members will know, the European Pillar of Social Rights sets out 20 principles.  I just had a meeting with your T&aacute;naiste; I am not sure if my pronunciation is very good.  I remember very well he was Taoiseach at that time and signed the European Pillar of Social Rights in Gothenburg.<\/p> <p>  The European Pillar of Social Rights Action Plan contains three EU-level targets to be achieved by 2030.  The first is that an average of 78% of people aged 20 to 64 should be in employment.  Ireland proposed its own national target, which is close to this average.<\/p><p>It is higher than the current average in the EU, which is around 72%.  The second target is to have at least 60% of all adults participating in training every year.  In this regard, Ireland proposed a higher proportion, which I believe is 64%.  The third target is to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion by at least 15 million.  I always insist on saying &ldquo;at least&rdquo;.  Among the 15 million, there are to be least 5 million children.  I am convinced that Ireland will be a strong contributor, as it always has been, in achieving these targets, not least because of its ambitious draft national targets, which I mentioned.  Ireland is already among the top performers of the Union in many aspects.<\/p><p> We have just had a discussion on the Irish labour market.  The shortages in the labour market show the dynamic of the Irish economy.  I must also mention the excellent educational outcomes in the Irish system, especially regarding individual digital skills.  Ireland is certainly a country in which the digital transformation is very much ahead.  The profound effect of social transfers on poverty reduction and improving equality indicators during the past decade all point towards Ireland being an extremely resilient nation and economy.  How it came out of the Covid crisis shows this resilience and capacity to adapt and innovate.<\/p><p> It is imperative that the social dimension go hand in hand with the economic recovery.  This is in the spirit of this Commission.  We want economic innovation, modernisation and competitiveness.  We are very much focused on the two big transitions: the climate transition, which is a must for every nation, and the digital transformation.  Digital modernisation is key to the competitiveness of our economies, European society and our international competitiveness.  Linked to that, we need to take fully into account the social consequences.<\/p><p> Let me say a word on Covid-19 and changes to the labour market.  New work patterns have been born out of necessity, while others have been triggered and accelerated due to the possibilities offered by new technologies, especially digitalisation.  More and more workers are engaging in platform work, which provides quick income but often puts individuals in a precarious situation.  I will say more on this topic later.  Perhaps we can discuss it because I have understood that the Irish Government is working a lot on these issues.<\/p><p> Some occupations faded because of the lockdowns, and many workers walked away from certain jobs in sectors that are now struggling to survive and recruit qualified staff.  This is also a big issue.  The construction sector is in major need of qualified, skilled people.  So too is the hospitality sector.  The Irish economy is very much focused on tourism and hospitality.  Therefore, we have to make sure these sectors have an opportunity to come back after the difficult period caused by the Covid crisis.<\/p><p> Numerous workers have chosen to move to rural settings and to swap urban life and commutes for distant work, thus giving way to the creation of new jobs and services where they did not exist.  This has accentuated already apparent labour and skills shortages across Europe in many areas.  In health and care provision, there are many traditionally underpaid, difficult jobs that fail to attract new workers.  We have seen how important the care sector is, especially during the Covid crisis.  An ageing population points to the importance of having a sufficient number of qualified workers in the care and health sectors. <\/p><p> I am aware that Ireland has a very active, dynamic education policy to adapt its education systems to this transformation.  It has strengthened its vocational and educational training, which the Commission is supporting very strongly because it believes, precisely in light of the transitions, that vocational training is an important tool in building the bridge between education or school and the jobs market.  I will be interested in listening to the members&rsquo; comments and ideas on that.<\/p><p> On remote working, teleworking has become common practice among many professionals.  I always say that remote working and the rapidity with which we introduced it &mdash; it happened in a few weeks or months whereby we all became accustomed to working on screens or by computer &mdash; saved our economy, especially our services economy.  Ireland is very much a services economy.  I am from a country that is quite similar to Ireland in that it has banking, insurance and all kinds of financial services.  These were safe because we could continue working through remote working.  This is a big change to how people work, and we certainly have to focus on how working conditions associated with remote working, occupational safety, health issues and even mental health issues are treated in this context.<\/p><p> Working time is certainly an issue.  The focus of the directive adopted nearly 30 years ago is still very much on the industrial system of work.  Circumstances have changed for many people and sectors.  This year, there is to be an evaluation of the functioning of the directive.  We really must reflect on how working time arrangements function and are organised in the new economy, which involves not only remote working but also new systems of work organisation.  This is certainly an important issue.  Afterwards, we can perhaps discuss the proposals made by the Irish Government on remote working and the right to disconnect, which has been introduced in some countries and which is under discussion in Ireland.  It has been introduced in quite a number of companies.  Big companies have introduced their own systems concerning the right to disconnect.  It is a matter of how we can organise it at European level by respecting the specific needs of companies, different cultures and so on.  We will start discussing this &mdash; next week, I believe &mdash; at a conference of social partners and experts in Brussels to determine what can be done at European level.  I am aware that Ireland is very keen on subsidiarity and respecting social partners, social dialogue and collective agreement.<\/p><p> Let me say a word on health and safety at work.  In general terms, we have proposed a new strategic framework on health and safety at work for the period 2021 to 2027.  Through the negotiations with the European Parliament, we have made important progress on protecting people from dangerous substances, including carcinogens and mutagens.<\/p><p>The last achievement just before Christmas was really astonishing in that the Council member states adopted the proposal unanimously.  There is an awareness of the need to better protect people here.  Asbestos is another important subject.  Unfortunately, it is still the case that many people die because of asbestos.  It is very much linked to construction and to the renovation wave we need in terms of climate and energy.  We have to make sure that not only workers but people are protected.<\/p><p> In regard to platform work, which I mentioned earlier, the Commission has made a proposal for a directive here.  We have discussed this with the T&aacute;naiste.  We do not want to stop or hinder the development of platform work, which is a new model, a new activity, linked to technology on one side but also demands in our markets among people who like to have these kinds of services.  We want to promote it.  It is creating jobs and helping many mainly young people to enter the jobs market or to have a part-time activity, which is very good.  At the same time, we have to make sure that this does not become the kind of world of work dominated by precariousness where people have very low earning and when they have an accident there is insurance and no social or hazard protection.  This is the objective of the Commission's proposed directive.  We are at the beginning of discussion on it in the Council and in the Parliament.  The idea is that we need some kind of a level playing field for Europe because there are many differences in the legal systems, which we do not want to change fundamentally but we, at least, need this kind of level playing field in this area.  The issue is the status of those working for platforms, namely, are they independent workers, self-employed or workers.  Many of them are probably workers but they are not treated as such.  They are considered by the platforms as self-employed and they are denied a certain number of rights that workers should get.  I have raised the question as to whether in Europe there are many illegal cases across jurisdictions.  We want to ensure there is more clarity and more security, including legal security, for those working on platforms.  We need to bring the platforms, with all of their innovation parts, which we do not put into question, into the social framework we have created for all other companies.  There cannot be a business model outside of the fundamental rights which have been established all over Europe.  <\/p><p> There is also the issue of algorithms, which are part of the platform business model.  The platform functions through algorithms, so we need to examine the rights of people in regard to algorithms.  This is a new area.  The Commission has proposed a special act on artificial intelligence and algorithms.  We have to see what impact algorithms have on the world of work.  This will open a very important discussion about algorithmic management.<\/p><p> I thank the joint committee for receiving me and for giving me this opportunity.  I am happy to engage with it on the issues I have just mentioned or any other issues members may have in mind.  I look forward to our exchange.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicolas Schmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":586,"content":"<p>I thank Commissioner Schmit.

It is great to have him here.  This is a very useful change.

I agree wholeheartedly with that.  I do not know if the Commissioner is aware that Ireland is an outlier in Europe in that it is one of only two countries that does not have a statutory right to collective bargaining.  That is a major problem for us.  When it comes to workers demanding better conditions and better pay, the only means of doing that is through collective bargaining which, as I said, in Ireland we do not have a statutory right to.  In his role as Commissioner, will Mr. Schmit defend the upcoming directive on adequate minimum wages in the EU, in particular the collective bargaining aspect of the directive from aggressive lobbying?  I fear that this directive will not be binding.  I would be please to have the Commissioner's reassurance that the issue of collective bargaining will be fully included and that he will resist the aggressive lobbying to ensure that it will be binding rather than just a recommendation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#F00300","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646265600,"counter":588,"content":"<p>The issue of fair play is an important one.  That is the reason we made the proposal on minimum wages.  Comparing minimum wages in the European Union, Ireland has the second highest minimum wage.  There is one country that has a higher minimum wage, which is the country I know quite well.  This is one aspect on minimum wages.  The Senator touched on another issue.  The directive is a directive not a recommendation.  It also addresses the issue of collective bargaining.  The Commission as a whole and, in particular, the President of the Commission, are very much attached to the idea of a social market economy.  It is not just a market economy; it is a social market economy.  This means that collective bargaining and a fair relationship between employers and employees, are important in the context of this social market economy.  The idea of promoting collective social dialogue but also collective agreements is one of the objectives of the directive.<\/p> <p>  The point is the Commission does not have large powers on this issue.  The treaty does not give us such powers.  There are good reasons for that.  I do not want to put this into question, rather I am reflecting the treaty position on this point.  For instance, we cannot impose a collective bargaining system or the role of trade unions or employers organisations in the different member states.  It is possible for us to make proposals which interfere in industrial relations but this can only be done by unanimity.  As the Senator will know, unanimity is not easy to achieve.  Sometimes, we achieve it, but it is not easy.  In this directive we also wanted to address the issue of collective agreements and collective bargaining.  We have many different cultures.  The Nordic countries want only collective bargaining and nothing to do with a statutory minimum wage.  I had some difficulties with them on the statutory minimum wage issue because the Nordic system is built on collective agreements.  In other countries, collective agreements are very low, especially in central Europe, where we at under 20% or sometimes even less.<\/p><p>However, we consider that for the social market economy, we need better systems of industrial relations and also a stronger collective bargaining system.  How can we achieve that?  Certainly, we leave it to social partners and member states to organise that.  We have now asked member states to have a plan negotiated with their social partners on improving social dialogue and the collective bargain system.  We cannot prescribe member states to do this, but we invite them through this plan.  The plan is an obligation, it is not just on a voluntary basis that every member state should have this kind of plan.  For the Austrians it is easy because they are at 95% of coverage by collective agreements - one cannot be better.  On those where collective bargaining is low, there may be some reasons for that also, such as the structure of the economy and so on.  However, they should work out a plan to gather with their social partners on how they can improve the system of collective bargaining.  That is maximum we can do in terms of our legal competence for the treaty.  We will certainly, once this directive is adopted and I hope it will be adopted with this element, follow up on this.  We will ask member states to work on this plan together with their social partners and obviously in the objective context they have.  Some have very strong unions and others not.  We have a difficult situation in some central European countries but we are inviting member states to work on this according to their traditions and legal systems.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicolas Schmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":590,"content":"<p>The Commissioner has given a clear answer.  It is probably not as positive as I wanted it to be but I understand the point he is making in terms of the limitations that he sees in place in this regard.  There is certainly food for thought there.<\/p><p>As my time is limited, I will move on to a second topic, which is the one the Commissioner addressed as the so-called &ldquo;platform economy&rdquo;.  Having agreed with one of the earlier parts of his speech, I will now respectfully disagree with something in the opening statement provided.  He stated:<\/p> <blockquote> \tNo one is trying to &quot;kill&quot; or hamper the platform economy from developing.  Quite the opposite.  We want it to thrive. <\/blockquote> <p>Just ten minutes away from here is Camden Street and I stay in a hotel just beside it.  Each evening in the darkness, one sees young people gathering with their bicycles.  They are not being paid; they are just gathering outside like the hiring fairs of old, waiting to see if they will get a fare to deliver some fast food.  They have no rights.  They are deemed to be self-employed.  The only word I would use to describe this is &quot;exploitation&quot;.  I would be concerned at the Commissioner&rsquo;s point of view that he wants this platform economy to thrive.  I do not want it to thrive.  I want it to be regulated.  I do not want my son or daughter to have a future whereby the wake up in the morning and look at an app on the phone to see whether they have work that day and what kind of work it will be.  I am concerned with that statement and I would like to give the Commissioner the opportunity to respond and reassure us that the EU will take concrete and resolute steps to effectively regulate this platform economy in order that all workers have rights.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#G00200","speaker":"1660"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646265600,"counter":591,"content":"<p>I can agree with the Senator.  If I say we are not against the platform, as I said before, because this corresponds to new technological possibilities and to a demand in our society, that should not mean that this economy and these platforms are developing just on an absolutely unacceptable level of protection or wages.  I have nothing against the platform and I am even in favour of them developing.  However, they can only develop of they respect the fundamental social labour rights in place.<\/p> <p>  We all see these young guys, as the Senator described, in our cities.  They are mainly guys, by the way, there are not so many girls but there are many young guys.  They have no minimum wage.  They have a very small salary or they do not have a salary because they are considered self-employed.  If they have an accident, they have no protection.  We want to change that.  We have to force the platform to respect that.  I have a strong conviction that one cannot allow these kinds of companies &ndash; because they are companies, even if they call themselves platforms &ndash; to just develop and earn a lot of money by keeping the social standards at the lowest possible level.  This is what we are aiming at.  We want to change this.  We want to state clearly that these young guys, as most are guys, have the right to be protected.  They first must be recognised as workers because they are not entrepreneurs.  If I were a young person obliged to earn some euro because otherwise I would not have an income, I am not an entrepreneur because I have a bicycle; I am waiting, as the Senator described.  What we are doing here is not going against the platform.  We are against the working conditions of most of the platforms; perhaps not all of them, but many or most of them.  This is what we are doing.  <\/p> <p>  I am convinced that the platform can adapt to that.  They absolutely can because some have already.  I would not say that working conditions are fantastic but they have respected at least the basic working conditions and salaries and they also consider the people working for them mostly as workers.  Some are considered self-employed but then they have to respect them also as self-employed with rights.  By the way, we are now introducing the right for self-employed also to negotiate collectively with the platforms, which was up until now more or less impossible.  I am sorry that I have perhaps not been well understood, as the Senator read my statement.  It is clear that what we want is fair social conditions for platform workers.  This means that, for many of them, they have to be recognised as what they are in reality, namely, workers with all the rights in terms of wage and social protection.

We see the impact on the energy supply routes and in Germany's decisions, where, following the abandonment of nuclear energy, there is now a significant shift in its approach.  Elsewhere will follow suit.  In the agriculture sector there is a shortage of supply from the traditional grain markets and a shortage of fertilisers.

I am particularly interested in people who find it difficult to get work because of disadvantage such as people with disabilities, migrants, disadvantaged youth and, in Ireland, Traveller and Roma communities, and any initiatives that might be in place to assist those people to gain employment given that they start with disadvantages anyway.  Two years ago, an initiative was established here, called the Open Doors Initiative, whereby the private sector got involved in supporting these groups.  This has grown quite strongly and many thousands of people have been impacted and supported.

I was interested in his comments regarding the right to disconnect and remote working.  He said that it has a positive impact for rural areas and rural communities across Europe.  I am from a region that is within an hour of four cities and prior to the pandemic people travelled back and forth to the cities.  It was a round trip of two to three hours every day.  They quickly adapted to remote working with Zoom, Microsoft Teams and the like.  Like other member states, we are focusing on putting through legislation to support employees with remote working.  As the Commissioner said, it creates a great opportunity for rural areas.  Something else is possible as well.  I could be remote working for a company in Ireland and living in Ireland today, but could decide next week I want to move to Faro in the Algarve.  What does the Commissioner see as the European Commission's role over the next months and years regarding the rights of employees and the rights of employers where people will in the future decide, for example, they are working for a company in Dublin but living full time in Italy?

I enjoy very much being back in Ireland and in Dublin.<\/p> <p>  On the issue of the crisis and this war, we fully agree that what is happening in Ukraine is a catastrophe and something unacceptable.  It is a profound change in our international system, especially in Europe but also globally in the international system.  The positive side of that, if we can say that, is that probably Mr. Putin miscalculated one thing.  He thought that he could divide Europe inside and he could divide Europe from the US.  The positive thing is that we are now closer allies to the US.  I know the special situation of Ireland in that context with regard to NATO and so forth, but I am giving the broad picture.  We are closer than ever to the US and we have shown the highest degree of solidarity inside the Union.  We really move together.  I always say this.  There are some people who say that the founding of the first European community was based on steel.  Ireland was not yet part of that; it was steel and Ireland had no steel.  It was steel and coal.  It was not Schuman and all the fathers of Europe, but it was Stalin because people feared the invasion and the policies of Stalin.  In a way, what Putin is doing is the same thing because we have understood that our collective response and our solidarity are the right response to a new threat that we had undervalued and underestimated.  This is a very important effect of this crisis.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that all that has an impact also on my portfolio.  Some say that now we have to invest much more in defence and the like, and that this has to be transferred from somewhere.  It is the choice between butter and cannons.  What is important, and we have to reflect on it, is, first, that what Putin is playing on is not just dividing European countries but also European societies.  He tried it by funding certain parties.  What Stalin made with the communists, he makes with other political families.  I will not go into this but the members know that very well.  It is dividing our societies and undermining the cohesion of our societies.  The cohesion of our societies is key, especially in times that are much more insecure and uncertain.  This depends certainly on economic strength but also on social resilience.  We have taken the lessons from the Covid crisis and we have to take the lesson of this crisis.  Social should not now be considered a second priority.  We still have to invest in social, first in education and more equality.  That comes to the Deputy's question, which is a very good example of what has to be done on social and those who are still excluded in our societies.  We have broad groups of people who are not taking part as they should in the social developments.<\/p> <p>  On the other impacts, certainly on prices, we are in a difficult period.  Even before the attacks and the aggression, we had inflationary tendencies after Covid.  We all expected these to be relatively temporary, but now there is a risk that they will last.  Not everybody, but many of us experienced the oil shock in the 1970s.  Well, we have something like the oil shock in the 1970s.  Our economies have changed but, nevertheless, we still have a high dependency on oil and gas from some countries and especially from Russia, so there will be an economic impact.  There will also be a social impact through the increase in prices.  I saw that the Irish Government has already taken some measures to mitigate the social impact of this.  This is an important issue and I believe we have to invest a lot in the coming years.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the Stability and Growth Pact.  The priority for different reasons - climate reasons, organisation of our economies reasons and energy dependency reasons - is huge amounts of investment, certainly private but also public.<\/p><p>Not everything can be done on the private side.  We have also to increase public investment in infrastructure.  Public investment in renewable energy, for instance, is important to lower the dependency in that sense.<\/p><p> On agriculture, an important topic in Ireland, there was a ministerial meeting a few days ago.  We have a problem of grain prices going up, which has an impact on living costs but also for farmers.  Much animal feed is imported, partly also through Russia or Ukraine, and this has an impact on costs for farmers.  This means that the cost of meat and other food is increasing.  This is a tricky issue of how we try to keep inflation down.  As to whether we can do it only by means of monetary policy, I am not convinced.  It is another tricky issue.  Certainly, we have to take these inflationary tendencies seriously.<\/p><p> On immigration, we have to be in full solidarity with the Ukrainian people.  Hundreds of thousands of people who had housing, who had everything and who had jobs in Ukraine have been pushed out.  Their lives have been destroyed.  There is their children's future to consider.  We have to show absolute solidarity.  I have exactly the same view.  I must say also that this is a change because we had an immigration crisis not so long ago.  This time it is different, perhaps because it is in Europe.  We have to be in full solidarity, which is also a cost.<\/p><p> We have to support those countries that are on the front line - we have to call it that.  We have to support them.  We will finalise next week the mobilisation of European funds to support these countries but also in order to support the families, including many women and children, because the men are fighting in Ukraine.  We can see that they might become workers.  Certainly, some will.  We have to encourage them.  Most of them have in mind to go back home but nobody knows when and under which conditions they will be able to do that.<\/p><p> On the poor, the disabled, etc., we have a programme in disability, especially a strategy for creating equality.  Accessibility is one issue.  There is still a lot to do.  We have to encourage companies to reduce their prejudices against disabled people.  We have to allow disabled people to get better training and better skills.  If we have a shortage on the labour market, there are many people who want to work.  We have to give them the possibility to work.  We will come up with a proposal on how to better integrate disabled people in our labour market.<\/p><p> Migrants are somewhat in the same situation.  It is not wise to leave them outside the labour market for months and years and then say that they are not integrating in our society.  How could they integrate because they cannot work?  Now there is a new picture.  We should skill them.  We should reskill them.  We should use their will in most cases to be part of the society and also the labour market.<\/p><p> I will finish now.  There were a lot of questions.  On Roma, we have a strategy.  I note there is also a community here in this country.<\/p><p> On remote working, I have no answer yet to this question Senator Ahearn asked but it is a real question.  Here, we have to start a reflection at European level because this is a real European subject but I cannot give the Senator an answer yet.  We have really to start deal with this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#H00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicolas Schmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":604,"content":"<p>I thank the Commissioner.

We see after the Covid crisis, where at the beginning people were very much in favour of even mainly working by means of telework, there are now some doubts and people want to be also part of a team and go back to their offices.  We have to find the right balance.  The Commission, as such, cannot dictate the right balance between telework and workplace presence.  The principle that telework is now part of the work organisation is something we should consolidate.  How this happens, for instance, how many hours I should be on telework and how many hours I should go to my place of work, is partly a matter of my life and the constraints of the company to organise the work in the office or wherever.  If I like to be mainly at home and all the others want to be, we have to find some kind of balance.  I would say we should establish some principles - I can imagine that - but it is not up to the Commission to go into detail and say that it should be one third or two thirds of the time.  This is up to social partners.  Often among the social partners you get some basic line, and then social partners have to discuss and negotiate how this can be implemented.  When you are working in a bank it is quite different from other types of companies where the constraints may differ.<\/p> <p>  In principle, I said, \"Yes\".  We have to recognise telework as part of our work organisation.  Unfortunately, not everybody can work on telework.  If I am a nurse in a hospital, it is more difficult to be on telework.

He is most welcome and I am delighted to have him here.  I will reflect on some of the points he has made.  He mentioned corporation tax.  I will point out that, as the Commissioner will know, Ireland has moved significantly to harmonise tax rates in respect of large employers.  With respect to Ukraine, all of the Commissioner's comments are absolutely valid.  We support them all.  As he will know, we have dispensed with the requirement for a visa.  There is visa waiver in place for all Ukrainians coming to Ireland.  Ireland will certainly do its part and everything it can do to welcome refugees, to try to integrate them and to allow them to access our employer base as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the general discussion we are having, the Commissioner will be well aware that we have three pillars of employment in this country.  We have foreign direct investment, the public sector and the SME community, which is made up of the small and medium enterprises.  In this country, the SME community employs approximately 900,000 workers.  Within that, there is great variance between large and small employers.  With regard to the whole idea of harmonisation of working conditions, wages, insurance and pensions, does one size fit all?  Can one size suit all?  We are probably in agreement but I have to ask the question.  If you look at wage disparity in this country, you will see that high-level public servants, including ourselves, are paid well, as are people at the higher levels in the pharmaceutical industry.  However, there is a large number of people who are not paid well.  That is the first question.<\/p> <p>  This committee has done quite a bit of work with regard to the platform economy and one of the things that has recently come up, and which Europe will have to address, is that we have very large US multinationals that are using subcontracted employment services to employ people here in order to keep them at a remove from the main entity in the US.  We are going to have to find some way to properly codify that relationship.<\/p> <p>  In his submission, the Commissioner highlighted his desire for people to undertake onward training.  There are many people in this society who have to pay to access further education.  Perhaps the Commissioner could have some discussions with our Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on tax credits for people who want to engage in onward education.<\/p> <p>  I will refer to two other areas, if I may.  One is that of our agricultural sector.  As the Commissioner will know, we are a very large exporter of agrifood to Europe and across the world.  He has highlighted the difficulties that are coming with regard to inflation in the price of commodities and so on.  Ireland is a price taker and distribution is largely controlled by conglomerates in this country.  Is Europe developing any special initiatives to support food manufacturing in Europe, particularly at the primary producer end?  Is there something we can do that will help the primary producer rather than the processor or multiple retailers?<\/p> <p>  We are doing a lot and talking a lot about climate change and rolling out climate measures in this country at the moment.  Europe needs to do more in providing funding for research to develop climate technologies and to assist in their roll-out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#K00600","speaker":"1616"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1646265600,"counter":620,"content":"<p>On the more general points, we are all in diverse economies.  I come from a country whose situation is not so different from Ireland's.  We have thriving sectors that pay fairly high wages.  Our public sector must also pay good wages because otherwise nobody would want to work in it and the public sector needs qualified people.  We also have SMEs, whose situations differ greatly.  Agriculture is another issue.  Farmers deserve to have a decent income.  In that sense, my response is that one size certainly does not fit all.  We have to take this diversity into account.  However, it is clear that, in our society, there must be some kind of ground floor of social rights and a minimum wage to which everybody has to adapt.  Otherwise, nobody would ever go to work in an SME or in the hospitality sector as they would not be paid enough to allow for a decent standard of living.  I was a minister for labour.  By the way, yesterday I had a meeting with the president of SMEunited and we discussed these issues.  SMEs are the driving force in our economy and they are also largely job creators but, if their standards are very far away from the minimum standards people expect, they will not get the skilled people and those who really want to participate in a more innovative economy.  You have to find the right balance.  I agree that you cannot just say that big companies and all others must be treated exactly the same but there must be a floor with regard to social protection, wages and so on.<\/p> <p>  There must also be a possibility for people working in SMEs to retrain, because that is another issue.  There is a great need for SMEs to retrain, reskill and upskill their people because, as we have seen with the Covid pandemic - and even independently of the pandemic because it really just accelerated the issue - SMEs have to digitalise and modernise.  If you are a shopkeeper, you have to be more digitalised than ever.  Especially during the Covid pandemic, many shops tried to digitalise overnight to sell their products through the Internet and so on.  To do that as a small entrepreneur, you yourself have to reskill.  That was one of the messages I got yesterday from SMEunited.  It told me that we always talk about the workers but that we must also talk about the small entrepreneurs as they also have to reskill.  I fully agree with that.  As to how this can be done, for example, through subsidies or tax credits, I am favour of doing it through any means possible.  It is up to member states to find the right approach to further promote education, training and skilling through the most adaptive instruments because what they do in respect of big companies should be different from what they do for SMEs.<\/p> <p>  I will finish on the matter of subcontracting.  This is an issue.  It shows that we also have to do something to create level playing fields.  If there are new formulas whereby you can hire people and refuse them all sorts of social rights and wage levels, that will develop and an economy will be created wherein people do exactly the same work but do not have these rights.<\/p><p>This is something we have to look at.  The platform economy is an example, but that exists in other places.  In that sense, it is attractive because you can create your own platform, not pay people correctly, and say you are not a member of my staff, you are just a self-employed person working for me or providing me with services, so I will just pay you for the service and I do not care about all the rest.  This is a problem for the whole economy and for the financing of the social system and leads to inequality between people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#K00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicolas Schmit","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":622,"content":"<p>Pensions is one other area.

The first is the sustainability of our pension system and the second is the adequacy of what the pension system gives to people.  The problem of adequacy is that if people have a very low pension, this means we are creating a new area of poverty in society of elderly people who are in poverty, which is not good for society.  Therefore, it is a real issue everywhere.  Pension systems differ from one member state to another, but we must observe and do some surveillance on how pensions evolve and encourage countries to adjust their pension system, bearing in mind the major constraints of financial sustainability in the long term and also guaranteeing the adequacy of the pension system for people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUJ2022030300002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nicolas Schmit"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":624,"content":"<p>Before we finish, I have a question on the European social pillar.

Therefore, this is an objective, which I consider to be a realistic one, because there are countries achieving it.  They are the better-performing ones in the labour market, in innovation and at the level of companies.  The 60% is an average.  The countries at 20% will not achieve 60%, which is the reason we ask countries now to make proposals for their national plan.  Ireland has proposed 64%, so it is above the average.  It is not starting tomorrow but in 2030, so countries have some time to do it.  It will cost money, which has to be shared between companies and public finance, and sometimes even people themselves.  We all know that people are more reluctant to do it themselves.  That is why we have proposed the idea of some kind of individual learning account where people have money to invest in their own training.  It is to make them aware that training is important for their professional career.  It is about their professional career, which is no longer linear.  It might change a lot.  We must incentivise people to invest.<\/p> <p>  It is realistic that there is a need for effort.  The point is that many people who do not get this kind of training are among those who already have a low level of training.  Very often, their jobs might be in danger.  The approach is that we also have to bring in those people, the ones who do not get the training because they are not well trained.  It is a vicious circle.

I am accompanied, as he said, by Ms Mannion, assistant secretary general for special education and inclusion, and Mr. Ward, principal officer of the special education section.<\/p> <p>  The topic before the committee is aligning education with the UNCRPD and, in particular, a focus on the progress being made on aligning special education policy and provision with the convention.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion, I am committed to making a difference for students who have additional needs as part of an inclusive education system.  It is important I outline to the committee the Government&rsquo;s ambition to develop an inclusive education system that meets the needs of all children regardless of disability or other disposition.<\/p> <p>  As Minister of State, it is my firm belief our education system should be adaptable and responsive to the needs of students.  From my visits to schools across the country I have seen first-hand how this is the case in our schools.  At the outset, I pay tribute to all our school staff, at every level, for the work they do.  Through their work in the area of special education they celebrate the individual talents of every young person in every classroom.  That is as it should be.  School staff know true equality is about much more than treating everyone the same.  It also involves an understanding that different people have different needs and that where these needs are met and supported, people are liberated to achieve their full potential.   As Eleanor Roosevelt said, \"education is the cornerstone of liberty\".  By ensuring those with the greatest need receive the greatest level of support our schools make this liberty possible for everyone.<\/p> <p>  Persons with disabilities in Ireland have equal rights of access to education under the law.  The Education Act 1998 makes provision for the education of every person in the State, including any persons with disabilities.  The primary piece of legislation dealing with education for persons with disabilities is the Education for Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004, known as EPSEN.  EPSEN provides that a child with special educational needs should be educated in an inclusive environment with children who do not have special educational needs, unless it is not in the best interests of the child with special educational needs, or if it is inconsistent with the effective provision of education for the children with whom the child is to be educated.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 commenced in 2020.  It brings more transparency to school enrolment and aims to prevent discrimination on a number of grounds, including disability.  There is also provision in section 37 of the Education Act 1998 for the Minister to direct a school to open new special classes where required.<\/p> <p>  The Department&rsquo;s policy is to ensure all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.  This means children with special educational needs should be included, where possible and appropriate, in mainstream settings with the necessary additional teaching and care supports in place.  In circumstances where children with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are provided for.  We fully recognise that these more specialist supports and settings also have an important role to play.  I am happy to say most children with special educational needs are educated in mainstream classes.  The benefits of mainstream education are known and recognised.  We must continue to build a society with inclusion at its heart, where everyone is welcome and where full participation is the right of every person, no matter their background or need.  Our schools are where we nurture and develop the future of our society and there should be no barriers to inclusion, and no artificial segregation.  In the past few years, we have made huge progress in providing the additional special class and special school places necessary to meet the emerging needs of children and young people.  It is worth noting too that schools have bought into this vision of inclusivity, which is demonstrated by their willingness to enrol children with special needs in their mainstream classes and to open special classes where this is required.<\/p> <p>  The Department will this year spend more than &euro;2 billion, or 25% of its total educational budget, on providing additional supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of more than 60%, in total expenditure, since 2011.  There are now 1,854 special classes for children with autism in place.  Of those, 133 are early intervention, 1,205 are primary and 516 are post-primary autism special classes.  This provision for 287 additional special classes in 2022-2023 will bring the total number of classes to 2,405 in the 2022-2023 school year and will represent an increase of 339% since 2011, when 548 were provided.  Three new special schools have been opened in the past three years, with two being located in Dublin and one in Cork.  Additional places continue to be provided to ensure children with the most complex educational needs receive an education in line with those needs.<\/p> <p>  We have worked hard to strengthen and streamline the planning systems between the Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to ensure that there are sufficient special education places available to meet needs throughout the country.  Significant investment has been made to ensure schools have the necessary accommodation and facilities to receive children and young people with disabilities.<\/p> <p>  Professional development for teachers and school leaders is key to building capacity and confidence among teachers and their leaders and a truly inclusive culture and school environment.  I also refer to the extensive additional programmes provided to support students during the period of Covid-19 to ensure all students, including those with special educational needs, were supported and that their support continues through the Covid Learning and Supports Scheme, CLASS, in schools.<\/p> <p>  Complying with obligations of the convention is a priority for my Department and indeed the Government more broadly.  In this regard, there are a number of other matters that are relevant to building an inclusive education system.  This includes the policy advice from NCSE.  It is currently working on policy advice on effective special education provision generally and this will also address the requirements of the convention.  On the school inclusion model, we are aware, through policy advice from the NCSE, the current range of supports in schools, in other words, teaching and care on their own, do not fully meet the needs of some children with special educational needs, especially those with complex needs in the areas of speech and language, communication, sensory impairments, self-regulation and positive behaviour skills.<\/p><p>Under the school inclusion model, which is currently at a pilot stage, we aim to broaden the range of supports that are provided to include speech and occupational behavioural supports.  This is in order that schools will be better equipped to meet the needs of these children and in order that they can achieve better life outcomes.  We are currently working on a proposal to develop and to expand the pilot in the coming year.  <\/p><p> There is also a review of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  As members will know, this legislation has been in place for almost 20 years and it is timely that we would review it now.  There has been significant change in Department policy and educational provision has increased substantially in the intervening period.  There also has been legislative change that impacts on education.  This review will help to ensure that our laws reflect current policy and international norms on provision and inclusion.  I plan to make a further announcement on this matter shortly. <\/p><p> The Irish Sign Language Act 2017 provides people whose main language is Irish Sign Language, ISL, with certain statutory entitlements.  In recognition of this, yesterday I was pleased to launch a new scheme to provide ISL in-school supports for students who are deaf and whose primary means of communication is ISL.  We are creating a new, specialised in-school support post for individual students, so that they can fully access education and so that they can participate in school life.  We will also be providing training and support for the school community, including teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, to help with communication using Irish Sign Language.  This is a positive development.  It is the latest step in ensuring that we have an inclusive education system in which everyone is supported to reach his or her full potential.  I am confident the implementation of this Act in education will create a more inclusive school environment for these young people. <\/p><p> It is a priority for me to support the transition of young people with a disability right through the education system, with a particular focus on enabling young people to make informed life choices.  We are working with colleagues across a number of Departments to ensure that this remains a focus of the third action plan under the comprehensive employment strategy for persons with disabilities, which will cover the period 2022 to 2024. <\/p><p> In conclusion, my Department is fully committed to the full implementation of the convention.  This will be achieved through increased investment, through implementation of evidence-informed advice, as well as through consultation with teachers, parents, children, young people and general society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#A00300","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":636,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State.

While this can be a difficult area and we always will have issues and questions, I acknowledge that much progress has been made in recent years.  Although we all still have issues with schools, we acknowledge that much improvement has been made.  In her opening statement, the Minister of State referred to 2011 and showed us how far things have come along since then.  Nevertheless, we still have many issues to deal with.  <\/p> <p>  I wish to raise one specific issue that is of great concern to me at present.  Although it is not widespread, in some schools there is a slowness to accept special educational needs classes.  I think that is regrettable.  Is the Minister of State aware of this, because I have come across it?  She might find there is a need for it in a locality in which, despite the best efforts of the Department that even include allocating the funds to progress with a project, in some cases there is a reluctance to do so.  That is highly regrettable.  At this stage, I might ask the Minister of State to make a comment on that.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#B00300","speaker":"1674"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments, as well as for his acknowledgement of the progress that has been achieved to date.<\/p> <p>  On the special classes, I have been acutely aware of this since I came into this role as the very first Minister of State with responsibility for special education.  This is really about a collaborative effort with schools via the Department.  The Senator will be aware, and I mentioned this in my initial contribution, of the review of section 37 of the Education Act 1998 that is under way at the moment.   The majority of special classes, however, are opened through engagement with the schools themselves.  It is important to note that since 2011, and the Senator alluded to this, we have increased the number of special classes by 386%.  We were at 548 classes, and this year we are now at 2,118.  That is a substantial and a significant increase.  We want to work with schools to entice them, for want of a better word, to open a special class, to show them that it is in their interests and to show that there are increased capitation supports.  It is for the best overall, including for other children and not just for children who have additional needs.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is working proactively with schools on an ongoing basis in that regard.  In addition, we have an increased number of SNAs, of whom we will have more than 19,000 by the end of this year, which is a support in terms of opening up special classes.  As for schools with teaching principals that have two or more special classes, they are receiving additional administrative support.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#B00400","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":639,"content":"<p>We will now move to questions from Deputy Tully.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#B00500","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":640,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State and her officials and thank her for her presentation.  I wish to raise a couple of issues in respect of the progressing disability model.  While I acknowledge it is not under the remit of the Minister of State, it affects schools in that there has been a withdrawal of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists from special schools.  I am very concerned about that, as are the parents.  They are very distressed about it.  The Minister of State referenced the social inclusion model.  We had the NCSE before the committee recently, whose representatives also spoke about it.  To me, that sounds like an excellent model.  I acknowledge it is only a pilot programme at present but I would love to see it rolled out.  However, is one not in contravention of the other, that is, withdrawing services from a school and then looking at a pilot programme to put services into schools?  The right method would be to put the services into the school to support the students.  If we want an inclusive education and if we want students with additional needs to attend mainstream classes, we have to put in the supports to do that.<\/p> <p>  I am concerned as well that we have seen the expulsion of a number of children from special schools.  These are children with additional needs who are being expelled, disgracefully, from special schools.  However, the bottom line is that schools are not given the supports to support those students or perhaps the children did not get the supports at an early enough age to ensure they could engage in education as they go along.  <\/p> <p>  I would also like to comment on an issue that is connected to the progressing disability model.  They seem to have moved away from the assessment of need under the Disability Act 2005, which provides for a multidisciplinary assessment that outlines the health and educational needs of the child.  Instead, we have gone towards the child undergoing a standard operating procedure that I am told is an hour or an hour-and-a-half assessment, only for them to just be put on another waiting list.  As a result, they are not getting a diagnosis.  Then, when such children need to get into an autism unit, a special class or a special school, they are not admitted because the school states they must have a diagnosis.  When I brought this up with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I was told that they do not require a diagnosis to get into a special class or a special school but most schools have that in their admissions policy.  I seek clarification on that because it is a quite serious matter.  <\/p> <p>  I welcome the review of the EPSEN Act but I ask that it be fully implemented this time.  There were several aspects of that Act that were never fully implemented and, in particular, the individual education plans for children. <\/p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Andrews, may make the end of the meeting if time allows but he raised a concern about the lack of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in the Dublin 6 area, as well as the fact that every day, over &euro;72,000 is being spent on bussing children out of their localities and into special schools or autism units in different areas.  In this regard, 14 students are being bussed into one area in Dublin 6 from another area, when there is need in that area and Deputy Andrews is pointing to a lack of planning.  <\/p> <p>  My last question, I have a lot of them,  is on Irish Sign Language.  Irish Sign Language has been one of our official languages since 2017.  There is a course in Trinity College Dublin in which students who are deaf or who are hard of hearing can take Irish Sign Language as a subject and they will become qualified.  Yet, they are not recognised by the Teaching Council to teach that subject.<\/p><p>The Teaching Council tells us that it is not part of the curriculum and the curriculum tells us that the Teaching Council does not recognise it.  It has kind of been put from one to the other.  Does the Minister of State have a comment on that as well?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#B00600","speaker":"1513","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":642,"content":"<p>The Deputy has a number of different questions and I will try to deal with them as best as I can.  First, around the progressing disability model, the Deputy is quite correct that it is under the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s, remit.  Obviously, I keep a close eye on it because it has a direct effect on my remit.  It is being implemented by the HSE and existing therapy resources have been reconfigured into the geographically-based community disability network teams.  Following a specific request from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in April of last year, the HSE paused the removal of multidisciplinary supports from existing special schools.  It is a separate matter from the school inclusion model, which as the Deputy knows, our 2019 pilot was paused because of Covid and has now recommenced in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 7 area.  The Department is consulting with relevant Departments, including the Department of Taoiseach, the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and a memo will be coming to Government soon on that.  It has always been our view on the school inclusion model that it will be a complementary therapeutic resource.  It is not in lieu of the HSE therapeutic services; it is should be in addition to them and should, in fact, complement them.<\/p> <p>  The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act is there since 2004.  The Deputy is quite correct that parts of it were not commenced.  The Department at the time looked at parts of the Act and it was going to cost around &euro;225 million to try to roll some of it out.  That is why it badly needs to be reviewed and will be reviewed.  I set up a steering group and we are in the process of setting up an advisory group as well.  Then it will go to short consultation so that we can make sure that we have an Act that can be fully implemented.  There is no point in having an Act unless we can fully commence it.  It is very timely that we are doing that right now.<\/p> <p>  In terms of transport, we have approximately 15,500 children at the moment with special education needs who are transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools.  That was at a cost of more than &euro;289 million last year.  There is a review of that scheme currently under way.  The Deputy said that Deputy Andrews mentioned some pinch points that are happening.  I hope that review will enhance efficiencies and provide better value and a better service for students.  Obviously, we want to make sure that they have an efficient service when they return to school.<\/p> <p>  On ISL, I will look into that for the Deputy in terms of the Teaching Council.  I am not aware of why it would not be recognising it.  That seems to be an anomaly and it should be ironed out.  It is a very good course and it is a new course.  There six students, as far as I am aware, who are doing that at the moment and it will provide great specialist training for them.  I can follow that up for the Deputy.  <\/p> <p>  I thank that answers all of the Deputy's questions.

I want to begin by congratulating her and thanking her very sincerely for the recent opening and ongoing growth in the Our Lady of Hope School in my constituency of Dublin South Central.  I know that a considerable amount of work was carried out by her good self and her officials and also with the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I just want to thank her very much for that.  It is good to see.  There was a cry-out from the fantastic advocates on the ground and movement by those parents over the past number of years to constantly champion the use of building that was there that could be used for special needs education.  From the moment she started in that Ministry, she acted very quickly on it and I really appreciate that.<\/p> <p>  My home constituency in Dublin South Central is one of the greatest impacted from a lack of special education places in schools.  There seem to be historically older schools that, for whatever reason, are very slow to sign up and come online with the additional places that are desperately needed.  Children are looking across the road at schools that they have no way of accessing.  The Minister of State, her Department and her officials did an extraordinary amount of work in marrying up a child moving from one school to a school that is a natural feeder that did not have the provision.  This is a rolling, extraordinary work in progress on a school-by-school, child-by-child basis, when in actual fact, it could be moved to a greater global place where a macro plan is imposed on the schools where there is this level of hesitancy.  I would really appreciate an update specific to Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W because that is where there is this chronic shortage.<\/p> <p>  Children with special education needs have been particularly impacted by Covid.  If they were in mainstream, they perhaps lost supports when there was teacher shortage in the Delta round of Covid.  In addition, they were out of school and impacted and, in some instances, there was evidence of regression in their education.  Is the Department doing any research on that?  What actions are in place?  Will the summer education programme run?  Is there a possibility of special needs assistant, SNAs playing a role in that?  I note that on the SNA education programme, they all graduated recently.  I saw photographs and they are incredibly proud of just how professional the recognition is, how professionally they work and how well they are doing.  They have learned even greater skills as well.  We need a special Covid response in this area. <\/p> <p>  Lastly, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement on ISL.  Does she have any idea of the timeline and when that will be up and running?  That will be really appreciated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#C00900","speaker":"1682"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":650,"content":"<p>The Senator asked a number of different questions.  Senator Murphy mentioned earlier the slowness or reluctance that the Senator mentioned about opening special classes.  It can be a cultural issue, but it can also be a suitable accommodation issue.  Training and professional development is required.  The NCSE provides, as I said earlier, exclusive and extensive support and training programmes as well as on-site and in-school visits.  I mentioned earlier as well the increase in special classes, more generally, across the country.  Specifically on Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W, the special education needs organiser, SENOs, as the Senator knows, work on the ground in terms of liaising with the schools regarding the availability of a space and have liaised in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W on an extensive basis.<\/p><p>As the Senator will be aware, most of those schools are on very tight sites and generally tend to be oversubscribed, but the work is continuing.  It is likely there will be a new ASD primary special class and one new ASD post-primary special class opening in Dublin 6W for September 2022.  However, the two new schools in question are finalising steps to open these classes, and although they have not announced this publicly yet, there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes in that regard.  Separately, Bishop Shanahan National School and Bishop Galvin National School are taking steps to expand their existing special classes for two or three pupils to cater for the standard six each from September 2022.  I imagine the Senator is already aware of that.<\/p><p> The question of regression that the Senator has raised is very important and is something I am acutely aware of since the pandemic started.  It has been particularly difficult on children with additional needs, and I do not think any of us could say otherwise, particularly because of the loss of in-person learning.  We have a number of programmes.  We had the supplementary programme last Easter at a cost of &euro;10 million and that helped some 14,000 children.  We had the summer programme for which we doubled the funding to &euro;40 million and there was an uptake of about 75% for that summer provision.  We also had the Covid learning and support scheme, which, to be fair, does not just help children with additional needs but also other children who have perhaps been adversely impacted by Covid, and that was some &euro;52.6 million.  It is still ongoing and is of great assistance to these children.<\/p><p> The research is going to be important in terms of assessing what impact the school closures have had on children and their achievements.  The inspectorate has commenced a series of research-focused inspections and it will be looking at overall trends to see how children have been impacted.<\/p><p> The Senator mentioned the role of SNAs in regard to ISL.  Obviously, the new ISL scheme I mentioned earlier will be of great benefit to deaf children and children who are challenged in terms of hearing.  We will have 40 different posts, 30 of which will be specialist in-class teachers and there will be ten who are advisers for schools in terms of ISL.  It will be about translating what the teacher says, and not just the content but also the spirit of what they say.  These are children whose primary means of communication is Irish Sign Language, so it should be of great assistance to those children.<\/p><p> I cannot recall what the Senator&rsquo;s question was on the role of the SNA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#C01000","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":652,"content":"<p>SNAs have come through the education programme that the Minister of State launched and it has been exceptionally well received.

We are a very dedicated committee and we are working to try to make a difference.  We often hear of committees formed and reports published and all of these things in regard to disability.  So often the rhetoric is about support, progress, numbers and funding but then there is the reality of disability services in Ireland and the reports that say things like &ldquo;wasted lives&rdquo;.  The rhetoric can be quite different from the reality.  We hear a lot from all of the different communities on this committee and it is harrowing every week leaving this committee after hearing the reality of what people are going through.  The Minister of State knows as well as all of the public representatives that one of the things we get the most from our own constituencies is families who are struggling to get an SNA in their school, space in a special class or even access to a special school.  For example, in Cork South-West there is no special school so people are travelling to the city and that could be two or two and a half hours depending on where people are.  There are a great many examples of this.  Ultimately, for us to be able to effect change, we need Ministers to come in and we do not always get such a positive response, so I thank the Minister of State for coming in to the committee.<\/p> <p>  I realise the issues around special education are a lot longer in the making than the length of time Deputy Madigan has been Minister of State.  In her opening statement, the Minister of State mentioned that people with disabilities in Ireland have an equal right of access to education under the law and that the Department's policy is to ensure that all children with special educational needs can be provided with an education appropriate to their needs.  The Minister of State and the Department have to realise that those statements are infuriating to hear for families who literally cannot get that education for their child to which, as the Minister of State said, they have a right and which they desperately need.<\/p> <p>  There are a few issues that I want to address but I want to start by addressing an issue which the Minister of State is probably aware of, which was in regard to the early intervention class in a primary school in Kilbrittain in Cork South-West.  It came as a real surprise to the principal in Kilbrittain, the parents and the students that the NCSE informed them the class was to close.  Fair play to the community, which rallied together and, thankfully, that decision has been reversed.  At the outset, I want to say that is very good and welcome news and we were all delighted to hear that.  What is still of huge concern is that the NCSE informed the SENO there that it was the national policy to wind down early intervention classes and to phase them out in favour of the access and inclusion model.  We all know on this committee, and the Minister of State would also know, that this would be an absolute disaster.  They are not the same thing.  Early intervention classes are crucial for the many people who need them, and what we would like to see is more of them.<\/p> <p>  I was hoping there was a miscommunication or some kind of misunderstanding.  When the NCSE representatives were in the committee last week, they were asked about this by our Chairman, Deputy Moynihan.  Instead of saying what we all would have hoped they would say, which was &ldquo;Absolutely not, no way, we would not dream of phasing out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model&rdquo;, their response was quite worrying and very evasive.  They said they did not want to comment and that they are waiting on the findings of the access and inclusion model report.  Of course, that would lead us to believe that is something the Department is looking at or, in a worst-case scenario, has already sort of decided that it is doing, and that it is prejudging the findings of that report and has started the process of potentially closing down early intervention classes.<\/p> <p>  Since raising the issue around Kilbrittain, I have heard from other schools which have been in the situation where the NCSE is trying to close their class and, in many cases, they have not managed to keep them open.  I know the response we constantly got from the NCSE throughout this was that it is based on need in an area and that it was already agreed with the school that it would be closed.  None of that is accurate.  In Kilbrittain, for example, they had the staff in place for the following year, they had the accommodation in place and they had students enrolled, so that is testament to the need in the area.  It is beyond me how that class could have been told it was closing.<\/p> <p>  What I really want from the Minister of State is an assurance that there is no plan or that we are not even waiting on a report to see if there is a possibility of phasing out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model.  If there is time, I might have more questions afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#D00400","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":655,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy.  Yes, I was surprised myself when this transpired and other Deputies contacted me in this regard as well.<\/p><p>I want to be clear that the national policy is not to phase them out at all.  I can say that from my perspective.  Sometimes they are transformed into special classes for mainstream.  I am, however, committed to early intervention.  We have more special classes now.  As stated earlier, we have 2,118.  Generally, the NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including ASD early intervention classes, where there is a need.  There is no change in the Department's policy.  I can reassure the Deputy of that, if that is of assistance to her.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#D00500","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":657,"content":"<p>Yes, it is very reassuring.  As a follow-up question, are there plans to open more of those classes on the basis of the obvious need that exists in many areas?  One of things I see a lot is that the transitions between the various educational stages being a major issue.  In that context, I welcome the increase in number of special classes in primary schools and give credit to the Minister of State for it.  However, that is not translating into secondary schools.  When people finish primary school, they ring every secondary school within a radius of an hour-and-a-half's drive.  There are waiting lists to get into special classes in secondary schools.  I presume the Department can carry out modelling to establish how many places are needed in primary schools and how many that will translate to for secondary schools.  What work is going on in respect of making sure there is provision for that?<\/p> <p>  On the specific issue of special classes, so many national schools are saying that they do not have enough SNAs and that they want to cater for all the children in their communities.  I know of a school that is fundraising through its committee to pay for somebody to come in and help because, otherwise, it will have to tell the children that they can only come in for a certain number of hours.  The school really does not want to do that.  One of the problems we saw in west Cork, particularly during the pandemic, was that many people relocated to the area from the city because they were working remotely.  There was a subsequent uptick in the number of school places but for some reason the SNAs remained in the schools in which they were working rather than following the students to their new schools.  It could take another year to get the required number of SNAs in the schools to which those children have moved.  I will leave it at that and see if I have more time afterwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#E00200","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":658,"content":"<p>The piece about transition from primary to post-primary school is obviously critical.  One of the challenges, as the Deputy mentioned, is when people move and we are not aware of that, particularly in the context of getting a special class specifically.  If a family moves all of a sudden, it can be difficult.  One of the things the Department has been doing in the past couple of years is making sure that we are more streamlined in our approach.  It struck me and others involved in this area that there had not been a proper forward-planning forecasting model for a considerable period.  Now, however, the building and planning unit shares its information with the NCSE.  As a result, we can see where capacity is going to be needed in the future.  Short-, medium- and long-term planning is going on at national and regional level.  That is based primarily on population demographics but also on the average percentage of the schoolgoing population that will require special class places.<\/p> <p>  I have said publicly before that I do not want to be in a situation where, in a year or a number of years, I will be back before the committee talking about the lack of special class places, particularly during transition time.  Unfortunately, there will always be cases where people fall through the cracks because of different factors, including moving from a special class to a special school, transferring from mainstream class to a special class or changing address.  In the main, we should be able to anticipate in advance in the majority of cases.  We have seen a growth in autism prevalence, for example.  It has increased exponentially in Ireland and internationally.  We have to cater for that.  Most of our special classes are for students with autism.  That is something we are very aware of.  The main thing is that we have the structures in place in the way we have them for mainstream schools that are not for children with additional needs.  If we can do it for schools of that type, we can certainly do it in the area of special education.<\/p> <p>  It is always open to a school to apply for an exceptional review if it requires an additional SNA.  Obviously, there is the front-loaded allocation.  In the coming weeks, schools will know exactly how many SNAs they will have for next term, which is important.  It is important to say that in a mainstream school, a child does not need a diagnosis to access an SNA.  However, we have an unprecedented number.  Since 2011, we have increased the number of SNAs by 81%, which is quite considerable.  There is always a demand for SNAs, and we have to ensure we have sufficient numbers coming on stream and adequate training for them, and that schools have the requisite number they need.  As I said, they can apply for an exceptional review.  Something like more than 50% of all exceptional review applications resulted in the allocation of an additional SNA or part of an SNA.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#E00300","speaker":"1472"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":659,"content":"<p>If 50% of those who seek a review subsequently get SNAs, it shows that an overly restrictive approach is being taken by the Department.  When so much time is tied up with trying to get both SNAs and special classes, it takes away from the time spent with students.  I hear from principals that this is the cause of major pressure.  We need to look at the system because if 50% of appeals are resulting in SNAs being allocated, then something is not right.  In addition, many of those who are appealing are not getting SNAs.  This is despite the fact that it is clear to everybody involved that they are desperately needed.<\/p> <p>  While it does not come within the remit of the Department, I wish to raise the issue of progressing disability services and the children's disability network teams.  Deputy Tully also touched on this matter.  In the context of what families are dealing with already, they are not even getting the first interaction with the children's disability network teams.  When we consider what families are dealing with already, we know that their first interaction with those teams is to be placed on a waiting list for months just to get an initial assessment in the context of getting early interventions such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy or occupational therapy.  These are crucial services that should be there for people and that they should not be fighting for but, trust me, most people are.  They are not even getting the first point of contact with them.  Then they cannot get a place in a special class, an early intervention unit, in access and inclusion or in a special school.<\/p> <p>  Another matter I want to highlight what people are experiencing and the real barrier they face in accessing education for their children.  In the entire constituency of Cork South-West - a person could drive for two and a half hours and still be in the constituency - there is no special school.  We know that not everybody can attend mainstream school.  Obviously, that is the aim and what everybody would like, but there are situations where a special school is needed.  For people to have to travel that far, when talking about education being a right for people, it is not even a possibility for many people.  I wish to highlight that.  I know it sounds very localised but I am sure it is the case in other areas as well.  I am not sure what the story is with the provision of those specific special schools, but I ask that the Minister of State looks at that area and see if a special school can be put closer to people, because it is just not feasible, particularly when talking about disabilities.  Some of the people and families I have engaged with, their child cannot spend that long in a car.  It is too enclosed a space.  A two-and-a-half-hour journey is turned into something much longer because they have to stop regularly for their child to get out of the car and have some space out of that environment.  A response from the Minister of State on the special school would be great.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#E00400","speaker":"1525"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":660,"content":"<p>An additional 1,165 SNAs were allocated in the budget.  They came on stream since January 2022 and will be allocated during the year.  Sometimes what happens is that a school has an allocation of SNAs and then it may get new children with additional needs in and, therefore, it has a requirement that may not have been anticipated at the beginning.  The NCSE has a criteria that it takes into account when allocating SNAs, including a baseline component, socioeconomic, gender, and the range of complex needs.  It can be quite niche in terms of how the number of SNAs are allocated.  In fairness, the NCSE always tries to endeavour that each school has sufficient capacity, but it is not always achieved and that is why the exceptional review is available.<\/p> <p>  On special schools, the Deputy will be aware that we opened a school in Carrigaline in Cork.  Danu Community Special School was opened in Dublin before I came into this position.  We have also opened Our Lady of Hope School.<\/p><p>There is always a place for special schools and the Department and the National Council for Special Education are always amenable to opening a special school where it is needed.  The Deputy is correct to say that education is a right.  It is right but it does not specify that it is a right in one's particular locality.  This is not to say that we do not endeavour to do that, because we do this for all children and not just children with additional needs.  In general, the Department will try to do that and in particular, there is an argument for children with additional needs.  As the Deputy noted, we do not want them having to travel extensively to the nearest education facility.  Where there is a demand, the most important thing is that the SENOs are aware of that in the National Council for Special Education in order that they can plan accordingly in providing either more special classes, more special schools, or classes in mainstream schools.  As I said earlier, most children with additional needs are in mainstream as opposed to special classes or special schools.  There are some 8,000 children in special schools and about 8,000 in special classes.  Where there is a need, I want to be aware of it.  If the Deputy ever has information where she knows of children with additional needs who need spaces then please do let me know and make sure that I am aware of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#E00500","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":662,"content":"<p>I will get in touch with the Minister of State about specific areas, that is for sure.<\/p> <p>  I have one last final comment.

This is a really problematic approach from the Department because it should not be a postcode lottery.  We have had people in before the committee who have said that when they came from Australia, the drop in services and access to education for their child was unbelievable.  They made the decision to move back here because they wanted to be near family.  Then, when they moved from Galway to Cork, there was the same drop and the service was completely depleted.

We try to do the same with special classes as well and mainstream classes but it does not always happen.  It can be difficult, particularly if it is one child who might need a special school.  The Department would look at it from a public purse perspective also.  Can it build a school for just one child or will more children need that special school?  There are a number of different factors that must be taken into account.

I apologise to the Minister of State for this but I will listen back to them.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, for her work.  It shows the importance the Government has placed on special education, given that we have a Minister of State dedicated to that.<\/p> <p>  My questions are both specific and general.  The first question is on the early intervention classes.  It was very good to hear the Minister of State's clarity on that in response to Deputy Cairns.  I wish to highlight a situation the Minister of State may be aware of.  The fantastic school, St. Colmcille National School in Togher, County Louth, has an incredible principal with an incredible commitment to early intervention classes.  That school is almost a victim of its own success whereby children leave the early intervention classes and go into the mainstream classes but because of the matriculation in how the NCSE derives SNA places, those children who are in need of extra SNAs do not get them in the mainstream classes.  If they had remained in the special classes they would have got more SNAs.  I am aware that the argument is to reduce SNAs when the need reduces but I believe that the SNAs are there to ensure that the child reaches his or her best potential and I believe they should have extra allocation for SNAs in a mainstream class.  It should be child-specific rather than class-specific.  This might be a way to review how we are allocating our SNAs to those mainstream classes for children who are really succeeding in the early intervention classes.<\/p> <p>  My second question relates to lessons that will have been learned through Covid.  We all have lessons we need to learn.  Will the Minister of State indicate if that work and research is ongoing?  I suppose we will not see the consequences of Covid on our special needs children for another couple of years but has any thought been given to making special education an essential service in order that these classes would not shut down again?  Will these disability services be made essential services so that, if there was a fear that we would have another pandemic or another crisis, these children would not fall off the edge and that they would have a continuation of service?<\/p> <p>  On SNAs and the fantastic course and the work that they do, will that new UCD course be accredited?  We have huge respect for SNAs and the committee knows the important work done by SNAs.  They keep our inclusive education system going.  Without SNAs the children would not be there.  Their multidisciplinary role within our schools is absolutely integral.  What is being done about accrediting that course?  Will there be acknowledgement of the levels of accreditation?  Will the course be accredited and awarded to those people who are doing it?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to our special classes and the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units that are dedicated to autism.  How do we encourage or help a family that does not have an autism diagnosis for their child, who does not fit into these ASD units but who absolutely does need a special class place?  I know of one particular family that is struggling to find a multidisciplinary special needs class.  They are not getting the child into schools because they do not have an autism diagnosis.  What would be the Minister of State's advice to me as a public representative and what is her advice for parents in this regard?  How do we organise or help schools to establish these multidisciplinary classes?  I am not sure of the proper title for these classes but how would we encourage and help that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#F00400","speaker":"1671"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":665,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  There are a number of different queries there.<\/p> <p> On St. Colmcille National School, the Senator may be aware that I did meet with the school and with the principal outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The school has four early intervention classes and they have made it clear privately and publicly that they want more SNAs.  I met them on 16 February.  They were also going to have a meeting with the National Council for Special Education this week, at my request.  While the NCSE obviously has responsibility for allocations, not the Department, the council is aware of my interest in it and hopefully that meeting will be fruitful.<\/p> <p>  On Covid and the closure of special schools and special classes, the public health advice at the time, based on the numbers moving in the system, was to close the schools.  There was priority reopening for special schools and special classes, which opened first in the summer of 2020.  They reopened first again in February 2021.  The Senator is right.  It is something that I absolutely do not want to see happening again.  Special schools and special classes, and children with special educational needs in mainstream, are an essential service.<\/p><p>I did all I could to keep special schools and classes open.  I want to assure the committee of that.  It was not to be, much to my regret although we did get them reopened first.  I do not want that to happen again if, God forbid, there was another pandemic or for some other reason.  That research will be critical in order to plan for that.  Special education is still an essential service.  We said that repeatedly.  We need to make sure it can also stay open as an essential service next time.  I take that point on board.  It is something I am very aware of for the future.<\/p><p> SNAs have sought accreditation for some time.  Their qualification does not detract from the calibre of SNAs.  Many are more qualified than they need to be to become a SNA.  There is a minimum qualification raised with the Workplace Relations Commission around this.  The Department is open to reviewing the position.  SNA accreditation will form part of the review of the outcomes of the training programme.  It can also be looked at in the context of the SNA contract and the Building Momentum pay agreement.<\/p><p> Children with additional needs would not be able to function in any proper way without the help of their SNAs.  They are critical for supporting these children who develop a special relationship with their SNAs.  SNAs do an awful lot of work.  Whether it is intimate care needs, yard work, homework, assistive technology or helping with breaks, they have many different roles.  We take that very seriously and will look at it into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#F00500","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":667,"content":"<p>Returning to advice for a parent of a child who has additional needs or is in need of a special class but has not received an autism diagnosis - forgive me, I do not know the name of the special class - how do we encourage that movement for schools?

The Minister of State mentioned forward planning.  We all have access to the constituency planning database.  We can see data on age and health demographics.  Do the Departments use that information for forward planning?  We can look at it at the constituency level and find out how many children from a certain age group have autism or whatever it is.  That would give an indication of what is coming down the road.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the Minister of State's comments and I welcome that she seems to be very driven and passionate about this issue.  She also asked for information to be given to her.  If the Chair bears with me, I will be as fast as I can.  A mother, Karen, asked me to relate her story so that the Minister of State will get an idea of what parents are going through.  Her story is not meant to be in any way aggressive but to show how disappointed and frustrated she is with the system.  She told me she has no school for her daughter, Emma, to continue her education into secondary school that is appropriate to her needs.  Emma, who is 12 years old, was born with Down's syndrome.  She has a mild learning disability diagnosis and is visually impaired.  She is in sixth class in the local mainstream school.  Emma's mother wrote that she was contacting me in pure frustration and hurt.  She said she knew it would be a difficult road accessing a secondary school appropriate for Emma, but she was gobsmacked to learn that the admissions policy for a special school has placed Emma at the bottom of the list of enrolment requirements because she is coming from a mainstream primary school.  She was referring to the Cope Foundation's Scoil Bernadette.  She said she was open to correction but she could not see anything like this enrolment policy in any other special secondary schools in east Cork or the Cork city area, under which a child meeting the criteria of having a mild intellectual diagnosis was placed last on a list because she was coming from a mainstream school.  There are 24 places in Scoil Bernadette.  From the feeder schools, 19 have been accepted and one sibling has been accepted from another school.  There are 15 applicants from the special school and ten applicants from mainstream schools.  There are 24 places and 45 children waiting on that list.  <\/p> <p>  The lady said she thought this was completely discriminatory and a poor reflection of the inclusion and inclusive living for children that we as a society strive for.  A family such as hers, who chose to bring their child up in a local community in a local primary school with local children was discriminated against when they tried to apply for a special secondary school because it accepted applications from special schools first.  Fear has dictated to many families, she said, and this gave them no option but to place their child in a local primary school for fear of not getting a place in a special school.  This is, she said, appalling.  She accepted that if a school was oversubscribed, a waiting list would kick in but what stood out for her was that if a child attends a mainstream school he or she does not have any hope of acceptance to the school.<\/p> <p>  The updated admissions policy was introduced in 2020 in Cork and Ross after the Schools Act of 2018 had been passed.  Added to that, the woman contacted two other secondary schools with mild diagnosis criteria in Ballincollig and Rochestown in Cork city.  Enrolments in Ballincollig are closed for the next two years and Rochestown has no enrolment for 2022 or 2023.  The latter has accepted three children from the 2021-22 waiting list.  It had over 24 applicants.  The local secondary school in Middleton has been mentioned as an option but it is an ASD unit and Emma has Down's syndrome.  The mother cannot see how that might be an appropriate alternative.  A plan B was for Emma to repeat sixth class.  That would ensure access to the secondary school next year.  The mother applied for 2021-22 and she was second on the waiting list.  She was then told verbally that Emma was disqualified because she had done eight years in primary school and could not repeat.  She challenged this because she knew there had been provision made for this previously but it had been shut down.  She asked me to bring this to the Minister's attention.<\/p> <p>  I know that is a lot to take in but can the Minister of State see the frustration?  This child, who attended an integrated school in a town, has been cast aside because of a range of little loopholes.  As Deputy Cairns said, she is going from west Cork to Cork city again.  The frustration is exacting such a toll on the parents.  The approach was not supposed to be nasty by any means but it is heartbreaking to see.  I know the family in question.<\/p> <p>  I raise this case because Emma's mother asked me to raise it but I also want to give the Minister of State the picture.  This is only one school area in east Cork which already has massive issues.  If I look at my constituency database, I can see this problem will continue for another while.  The Minister of State acknowledged that autism and autism-related conditions are on the rise.  I cannot understand why we are not planning for them.  I accept the Department is planning a large school campus in Carrigtwohill but we have to look at what this is doing to a mother and a 12-year-old girl who has no chance of leaving primary school and entering secondary education in 2022.  I would love if the Minister of State could assist me or even take on the case on an individual basis.  I heard her say she needs to have the information.<\/p><p>We can accept them.

The transport section in the Department is under the Minister of State's remit.  I refer to the special transport, either the grant for the family or the provision of transport through a taxi or through a company.  Issues arise and are ongoing.  Indeed, a number of parents I spoke to had to take the case to court to try to get the transport because they were moving from a special school to where there were better facilities and more avenues for their child to progress.<\/p> <p>  There are also technical issues such as the delay when the parent or guardian makes the application through the school for transport.  In September, October and November, families are always in limbo.  I, for one, have seen many families that have gone through an unsure period because they did not get a straight answer from the transport section for special education.  Is it up to specification or is it something that has been flagged with the Minister of State?  Should a greater emphasis be put on families that have made decisions to go to a particular school which is outside of their area and the transport grant, and the frustration that they experience?  The schools will say that it will take time as well.  Schools that are experienced in dealing with the Department say that there is frustration or a lack of urgency within the transport section of the Department.  Has that been flagged with the Minister of State?<\/p> <p>  This morning a number of members raised the exceptional reviews for special needs assistants.  We have one school in north Cork, Freemount, which has gone into its fourth exceptional review because of the change in dynamics in the classroom.  I spoke with the Minister of State earlier in the year about Newmarket.  Even though it is clear from the professionals, the teachers and the board of management accept that there is need for more special needs assistants, SNAs, to provide the best quality of education to the children who are coming through, they experience frustration.  Then the Department comes back looking for another review, which is almost submitting the same language - changing it around slightly but resubmitting it for a review.  It takes a long time for that review to take place.  The schools are highly professional in how they deal with their business.  When they present a case to the Department, they are always presenting a case in the best interest of their children who are coming in and for the school community.  There is a slowness in dealing with the exceptional reviews.  I wonder if that is the Minister of State's experience.<\/p> <p>  People are travelling long distances for special schools.  Has the Department looked at any real audit of the country and seen that there are large geographical areas that do not have special schools?  The Department should have a long-term plan to aim to put schools into particular locations.<\/p> <p>  As the Minister of State mentioned Cork city and Dublin, the issues in the large urban centres will be a noose around our necks in years to come because of the lack of services that are there, and when people have to move out.  I had one family in contact with me yesterday who were living in the city centre of Dublin and they are going out to Kildare for services.  That is not acceptable.  It is a considerable challenge for the Department to make sure that they are getting it right.  Has there been an audit from the Department's point of view to see the gaps in the services and the challenges that are there?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#H00700","speaker":"1456"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":677,"content":"<p>I might work backwards from the Chairman's comments.  The first thing that the National Council for Special Education will endeavour to do is to find a special class place, a special school place or, indeed, a mainstream place for a child.  Ideally, it would be, as I stated earlier, in the community or locality where that child lives, but that is not always possible.  As I mentioned, we have this forecasting model now.  The fact that the geographical information system is being shared from the Department's building and planning unit to the NCSE means that we should be able to anticipate that demand.  That is based on the population demographic but also the percentage of children who will probably need, from a statistical perspective, certain places, whether in a special school or a special class.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman is quite right that in the cities it is considerably more difficult.  Even when we look at it in the context of section 37 and trying to compel schools to open special classes, for example, some of them had legitimate reasons that they could not because they did not have the space.<\/p><p>They were short for space because they are in a densely populated area and particularly where there is a growing demographic as well.  It will be a challenge in the future.  It is absolutely critical that we get that right now and we plan for the future and build these buildings.  <\/p><p> One thing I did not get to mention is the fact that all new schools from last year will automatically provide SEN facilities going forward.  That is a huge thing for generations to come because that was never there before.  Rather than scrambling to add on infrastructure through the minor works grant or emergency accommodation or whatever it may be, we will not need to do that because the facilities will exist to begin with.  That should help alleviate that pressure going forward.  <\/p><p> On the exceptional reviews, the Chairman can bring that particular school to my attention since, as he said, it has had four exceptional reviews.  I presume the NCSE had an on-site inspection with the school.  Perhaps a meeting could be set up with the NCSE to discuss it and to understand why it is not being given an additional SNA if it is the case that it requires one.  Again, I mentioned earlier the various criteria where there is a baseline component and the socioeconomic reasons, gender and all of those different factors have to be taken into account.  Obviously, the level of need that is required is also taken into account, whether it is complex needs or whatever else is required.  Certainly, I can look at that for the Chairman.  <\/p><p> On transport, it broader than just special education.  There are about 15,500 children with special education needs who use the transport system at a cost of &euro;289 million.  The transport scheme is under review.  The Department outsources its transport to Bus &Eacute;ireann and it, in turn, relies on both its own services and private contractors to deliver services.  It is good that it is under review.  There have been, as the Chairman said, various different complaints anecdotally in relation to children travelling.  Again, we endeavour to not have children travel anywhere but, unfortunately, that is not always possible.  However, it is something we want to try to alleviate into the future, to try to get children a special school place or special class place in their locality, which would alleviate that need.  Certainly, the review will be welcome and there may be there may be outcomes from that we have not thought of or anticipated that may dictate policy into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/DMJ2022030300002#H00800","speaker":"1472","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":679,"content":"<p>I thank members online and present, the Minister of State, her officials and our team as well for their efficiency.

The amendments I have tabled seek only to strengthen and improve it.  A statutory skills register for the construction sector is important.  A register of builders is welcome, but the key reasons for this register are the difficulties we have had, which are well known, in terms of mica, pyrite, fire safety defects and construction defects, which have caused not only significant untold financial costs but human costs for people.  There are different reasons for this, including weaknesses in building controls and regulations, inspection of materials and, at times, deficits in terms of skills.  As part of the register of builders, we need a statutory skills register for the construction sector.  The Bill as drafted does not provide for that.<\/p><p>On Second Stage, the Minister legitimately made the point that it is necessary to have regard to experience as well as skills in terms of people that can access the existing register and that if we insisted only on skills it would have the effect of some people who have decades of experience and can do very good construction works and play a very important role not being able to register.  I understand that.  As of now, however, we are allowing only experience and not qualifications and certified skills to stand.  We need to move to having a statutory skills register of the professionalisation and qualifications that are needed.  Why would not that be done?<\/p><p>The amendment seeks that the Minister would lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months of enactment.  That is very reasonable.  It is not a huge obligation, but it would provide us with a path forward on this issue.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#A00900","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":692,"content":"<p>As the Minister of State may or may not be aware, the idea of a statutory register is older than he is.  It started its life in a Law Reform Commission report recommending its creation in the 1970s.  The proposition was strongly resisted by the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and not only by its equivalent at the time but also by architects, engineers and chartered surveyors.  It died a slow death between the 1970s and 1980s and was revived only by the Minister of State's party colleague the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Phil Hogan, when he produced his building control reform proposals after the Priory Hall issue arose.  It is an important proposal that would place all construction industry professionals on a statutory register and having a set of requirements to be able to trade and be a professional.  Having a formal complaints procedure for where people have been deemed to be in breach of the code and those criteria is important.<\/p> <p>  Two issues that relate to the amendments before us are very important.  There are many areas of construction where formalised skills are still not where most people in the industry would like them to be.  In the case of plastering, for example, there is a fairly mobile labour force from a variety of countries.  In many cases, on a building site where people come onto the site for work, they will not have to show a formal qualification but rather just demonstrate they can carry out the relevant plastering work and that may or may not suffice for the foreman or the contractor.  The difficulty, of course, is that creates the possibility for inadequate standards and workmanship.  I strongly agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the point is not to create a regime from the start that locks out people but instead is about moving towards circumstances in which there is a clear skills register in order that, when the registration body, which we will come to in the next amendment, is trying to determine whether the person is a qualified skilled professional to carry out that work, there will be a proper, statutory register against which those skills can be marked.<\/p> <p>  The other example that is important to mention relates to fire stopping.  The Minister of State will be aware from his knowledge of Celtic tiger-era building defects, particularly in apartments and duplexes, that fire stopping is one of the most common defects.  Currently, there is no skills requirement to place fire stopping in properties.  There is no course that has to be completed or qualification that has to be achieved, and that is one of the reasons, although not the only one, that fire stopping continues to blight the lives of thousands of homeowners and tenants in properties that were built without adequate fire stopping.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment is eminently sensible and it will probably be easier for the Minister of State to support his amendment or a version thereof than it will be to support mine, given mine seeks to insert in the Bill a requirement for a statutory skills register.  Even if he will not accept either amendment, this is something that makes eminent sense.  I suspect both industry and the unions think it is a good idea and, therefore, I am keen to hear his response.  Without such a register complementing the construction industry register, the Bill will be much weaker.  Accordingly, I strongly support both my amendment and that of Deputy O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#B00100","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":693,"content":"<p>I will address amendments Nos. 2 and 13.

Even so, we are far off the apprenticeship levels there used to be in areas such as bricklaying, stonecutting, tiling and plastering, that is, the key wet trades in construction.  There are many issues with that but in particular, there is simply no requirement to have a qualification in plastering to work as a plasterer on a building site.

There is no incentive, therefore, for people to get the qualification given it is not required.<\/p> <p>  This has implications, not least in respect of defects, as was mentioned in the context of people not having the proper skills and qualifications, but also for productivity in building and for having enough people who are well trained and qualified.

Section 8 is quite a bizarre section in the sense that it sets down the criteria that an organisation may meet to be designated as a registration body.  We all know who the registration body will be because that has already been decided and is a matter of public record.  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has the non-statutory register.  At first take, it is almost like rather than just saying we are giving it to the CIF, we set down in law a set of criteria the CIF can meet and only an organisation such as it can meet, which strikes me as odd.<\/p><p>However, that is not the central problem here.  The CIF is not the right place for this register.  Any of us who have lived through or who have worked with families affected by defective buildings know that in particular for that industry, the very last place to put a register of this kind is within the lobby organisation for those same organisations and individual contractors that this register will cover.<\/p><p>There is a long-standing tradition here, in Britain and elsewhere that we have these almost Victorian gentlemen's self-regulatory bodies.  We have it with architects, surveyors, engineers, etc.  That is a fundamentally flawed model and one can see that, for example, when one looks at the level of complaints and sanctions against members registered in some of those bodies but particularly with construction and particularly because one of the great values of a statutory register is that it will give the public confidence that we should not have a return to the same levels of defective workpersonship as we have in the past.  Locating this in the lobby organisation, albeit with some Chinese walls and some issues around governance and the board, makes no sense to me.<\/p><p>It is also very hard to understand given that the Minister of State's predecessor created a body which is much better suited to be the location of this, which is the National Building Control Office, NBCO.  For those members of the committee who do not know its good work, it was set up specifically to try to support, enhance and improve building control functions in local authorities.  If one were to take a longer-term view, the NBCO authority is exactly the kind of body that one would progressively build into a much larger and more effective building control and consumer protection agency, not unlike the Food Safety Authority, the Environmental Protection Agency, etc.<\/p><p>Therefore, my amendment, inelegant as it is, and I am sure the Minister of State will tell me all about the technical inadequacies of my drafting, and that is okay, is more to make a crucial point here, which is this should not be located in the CIF.  That is not disrespect to the good people of the CIF.  Its job is to represent, lobby for and advocate on behalf of its members.  However, if we want the public to have absolute confidence that this register is fully independent of industry and that it would be administered without fear or favour, then the right place is the NBCO.  That will place challenges, as the NBCO only has a small number of staff and has only been recently established.  However, given that it exists, I see no reason that this function would not be given to it and that is why I am pressing this amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#C01400","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":715,"content":"<p>Deputy O'Callaghan will speak on amendment No. 4, which is grouped with amendment No. 3.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#C01500","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":716,"content":"<p>I want to make similar points.  Of the whole Bill, this is the area that I have the biggest issues with.  My amendment is slightly different in that it looks to remove a number of the potential non-State bodies that this could be applied to.  It as not as specific as Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment is, although his suggestion that this would be a function for the NBCO is a very good one.  The NBCO needs to be beefed up into a national building control authority, like the Food Safety Authority, and given similar powers.  I do not see any reason that this would not be done straightaway.  This is no disrespect to the CIF, but it is very specifically a lobby group for the industry.  Therefore, if we want to have public confidence in this registration body, it is very important that it is not, as this legislation allows, run by industry lobby groups.  That is flaw in the legislation.  It should be a State agency.<\/p> <p>  Huge distress has been caused by building defects and I know we all have these issues in our own constituencies.  Priory Hall is in mine, and the family of Fiachra Daly is in my area and I know them well.  For us not to do this as well as we possibly could do it, in terms of establishing independence, does not make sense.  I would strongly urge the Minister of State to accept our amendments on this.  The NBCO would be the right place for this and it needs to be beefed up into a national building control authority.  That is the other piece of the jigsaw that would go well with register, that is, if we had a statutory national building control authority.

I will address amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that the Government may make an order appointing a body to perform the functions of the registration body.  It sets out that the body can be a public body or otherwise and it provides that the body must be capable of performing the functions conferred.<\/p> <p>  I must oppose amendment No. 3, which seeks to provide that the NBCO will be appointed as the registration body.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the Bill should not name the body that is to be appointed as the registration body in the Bill.  Where a body appointed is not performing the functions required, another entity may be appointed to perform the functions of the registration body under the Bill without any amendment being required to the primary legislation. <\/p> <p>  I must also oppose amendment No. 4, which seeks to only allow a public body to perform the functions of the registration body.

There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure and maintain the independence of the registration body.  The registration body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in the Bill.  The board of the registration body will be completely independent of the body in the performance of its functions.  The independence of the registration body will be maintained through the following measures: all powers of the registration body will be prescribed in legislation; all competency requirements for registration will be recommended by the board and prescribed by the Minister; the board will make decisions in relation to all sanctions, including removal from the register; removal from the register must be confirmed by the High Court; all prosecutions under the Act will be taken by the board or the director of public prosecutions; all members of the appeals committee will be independent from the board and the registration body; and the Bill allows the functions of the registration body to be transferred if the body is not performing its functions satisfactorily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#C01700","speaker":"1595"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":718,"content":"<p>I like that word \"envisaged\".  If the Deputy had said \"decided\", it would have been more accurate because we know it has been decided but I will not quibble over that word.  The problem is this register will be located in the same building as the Construction Industry Federation.  It will be staffed in the main by staff from the CIF.  If people have to make telephone calls to the registration body or go to meet it, that will be channelled through the infrastructure of the CIF.<\/p> <p>  A crucial point is that in order to restore absolute confidence that we are never going back to the bad old days of the Celtic tiger the legislation not only has to ensure it is fully independent and competent to its functions but the public has to be able to have confidence in it.  The perception is as important as the reality.  Have any cases been taken against any contractors under the voluntary register?  I do not think they have.  Have any sanctions been applied to remove people from the voluntary register?  I do not think they have.  If the Minister of State has figures in that regard, I would be very keen for him to share them.  Basing it on the same model we have for the Society of Chartered Surveyors, for example, or the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, is a flawed approach.  That approach has all sorts of problems.<\/p> <p>  The Government has a programme for Government commitment to actively examine the recommendations of the previous Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government report on building control and consumer protection, Safe as Houses?.  One of the things that report strongly recommended was a stand-alone building control and consumer protection agency which would be the location for, among other things, the construction industry register.  A review was recently undertaken of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I know the report has not yet been published but it has been so widely leaked I think most of us have read it at this stage.  That report makes some sensible recommendations for how to transform that agency from a function of the Department through a number of phases to, at some point in the future, become a fully independent body.  That is the report's recommendation and I support it fully.  This Bill would have been the ideal opportunity to do that with the NBCO.  <\/p> <p>  I have a two-part question for the Minister of State and I will not repeat the questions which prompted the technical answer he has given us.  Why does he believe the CIF is the right place to locate this register?  If it is about skills and competence in the building industry, the officials in the NBCO have just as many skills and as much knowledge of the good, bad and ugly of the industry.  Likewise, why does the Minister of State not believe the NBCO would be the right place?  It just makes eminent sense.  It is fine that the Attorney General has advised that the legislation should not name the organisation.  I am sure there are ways of doing it.  I am at a loss to understand why this is the proposition but I will hazard a guess.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State or his officials but given the long history of opposition to a statutory register by the construction industry, in particular, the CIF, I suspect that at a time long before the Minister of State and I were elected to this House, a compromise was reached in order to get the CIF on board with the proposition of a register that it would be located with the federation.  That was likely the trade-off to allow the proposal to progress.  If I am correct in that, and one day we will get the documents under freedom of information to establish whether that is true, it is a very bad proposition.  This register should be independent and should be seen to be independent and, therefore, I think the spirit of my amendment, if not the technical quality of it, stands.

Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment is very good but my amendment comes at this from a different point of view.  It does not name the public agency that would be involved but it would confine it to a public agency, which I think makes sense.  We have not heard the rationale from the Minister of State as to why he thinks it is necessary to include in the legislation the possibility that the registration body could be an organisation such as the CIF.  In fact, the specific lines in the Bill are written in such a way as to ensure the CIF meets the criteria but another body may not.  Those lines are quite specific in that regard.  Why, for instance, must the body to be designated the registration body have been in existence for a continuous period of not less than ten years?  That certainly rules the CIF in.  What is the rationale for this legislation barring a body that has only existed for five years but is totally competent?  What is the rationale for that?  Why does it have to be a body corporate which is not a company but has not fewer than 300 members?  It is quite detailed and seems to specifically set out criteria that the CIF happens to fit.  Why is that necessary?  Given that my amendment does not name a specific public body but would mean that it must be a public body, why is there an objection to my amendment?  Certainly the Attorney General's advice about not naming a particular body does not cover that.

There is nothing wrong with any organisation or entity putting its views across on public policy.  The CIF already has an established register.  It has the required skills and competence to undertake the role.  It is going to be underpinned by strong and robust legislation, with an independent board to ensure it is operated correctly.<\/p> <p>  As I outlined, there are safeguards if the registration body is not performing to the criteria set out in legislation.  The independent building standards regulator is being worked upon by the Government as well.  It has advanced under the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.

I still have not heard the Minister of State say why he thinks this organisation is the right one.  I hear him say the organisation needs to be competent, experienced and knowledgeable and I accept all of those points, but I have yet to hear somebody explain to me why the Construction Industry Federation itself would oversee it.<\/p><p> CIF does have a slightly different function in public policy from the two institutes the Minister of State mentioned; they are not primarily lobby organisations, they are primarily professional bodies that provide a host of supports and services to their members.  In fact, they are often very reluctant to give their views on matters and are much more circumspect.  We know, in particular under previous Governments but not under the current or previous Administration, the Construction Industry Federation was a semi-political body that in fact spent most of its time in direct political lobbying not the affairs of a professional body in the same way that those two other institutes are.  I will not speak beyond this contribution, but I invite the Minister of State to say why in his opinion CIF is the best body and why the National Building Control Office is not an appropriate body for this purpose.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#D00400","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":723,"content":"<p>In the first instance, as I pointed out, CIF has the experience from operating the voluntary register.

There is a bit of a contradiction here.  We are being told that the Construction Industry Federation is the appropriate body to run the statutory register because of its experience of running the voluntary register.  That is valid.  At the same time, we are being told that we cannot read anything into the fact that nobody has been struck off, because it is a voluntary register and most of the people who apply to be on it are more likely to be compliant.  By its very nature and the explanation the Minister of State has given us of the voluntary register, he has explained to us how the experience of enforcing compliance is lacking in a body running a voluntary register.  He has clearly made the case therefore as to why running a voluntary register does not give a body a lot of experience with enforcement and compliance issues.  As we know, the National Building Control Office has significant experience relating to building control, enforcement, and compliance because that is its skill set.  That is what it does.  The case for the National Building Control Office rather than the Construction Industry Federation is incredibly clear.  The Minister of State has helped to make that case as well in his comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#E00300","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"vote","time":1646265600,"counter":725,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 2; N\u00edl, 4.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#E00400","aye":["1550","1468"],"nay":["1595","1566","1626","1568"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":726,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 10, to delete lines 17 to 26. <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#G00100","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"vote","time":1646265600,"counter":727,"content":"<p>Amendment put:<\/p><p>The Committee divided: T\u00e1, 2; N\u00edl, 4.<\/p><br\/><br\/><p><\/p><p>Amendment declared lost.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#G00200","aye":["1550","1468"],"nay":["1595","1566","1626","1568"],"abs":[]},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":728,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 11, to delete line 13.  <\/blockquote> <p>My question is about the definition of &quot;public morality&quot;.

Will the Minister of State elaborate on the kinds of persons, organisations or assistance?<\/p> <p>  My amendment, amendment No. 9, relates to section 18(3).  The nature of the provision struck me as very broad.  It states: \"The registration body may make rules for facilitating and discharging its functions and the functions of the Board or a committee of the Board.\"  I would have thought the making of the rules would have been more appropriate for the Minister, Government or some such body.  Maybe it is the nature of these rules are of a different order and, therefore, they do not require an outside individual such as the Minister of State or Government.<\/p><p>However, I would prefer to see some level of requirement for engagement with the Minister and the Oireachtas on the setting of rules.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 12 relates to how there are still significant question marks in the public arena over sections of the construction industry.

One of the weaknesses of our construction sector is that there are not enough career progression opportunities, particularly to attract young men and women into the sector with clear career pathways that allow them to build and grow their skill sets and, therefore, their terms and conditions of employment, rates of pay etc.  Therefore, the need for greater access to the National Training Fund for upskilling construction sector workers is important.<\/p><p>If the register is at its very core about ensuring best practice and improving standards, then the broad principle of this amendment, which is about accessing the fund in the first instance, but, more importantly, upskilling construction sector workers currently in the profession and those we would like to see enter into it, is quite important.  This amendment was really to give me an opportunity to raise that with the Minister of State but also perhaps for him to provide an update, if he can, on any work his Department is doing with other Departments and the construction sector working group chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which is obviously discussing this issue as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#L03500","speaker":"1468","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":811,"content":"<p>I will address amendments Nos. 14 and 15.

I have spoken to a number of medium-sized contractors in different parts of the country.  One of the concerning things they told me was that they are beginning to notice a drop-off in the number of young people who are entering into a variety of construction industry professions.  When I asked them the reason, because they are talking to people and trying to recruit them into the industry, they said the nature of the work and additional stress of, for example, travel times and insecurity between jobs compared with the lack of career progression and new opportunities to upskill and develop, is a real problem.  We might look at countries that do this really well.  Scotland, for example, has made great strides in recent years in providing good-quality career progression and upskilling.  Germany is probably one of the best in terms of its career path progression.  It is really important.  I look forward to reading the note.<\/p> <p>  With respect to the code of practice, I must say that I do not agree with the argument against it insofar as building regulations are changing quite a lot.  They change all the time, which is a good thing, and they will continue to change.  In terms of the code of practice, I would have thought it made eminent sense to have it here.  I have tabled amendments elsewhere in which I would like building regulations inserted as well but I can see no reason why not to put it here.  If this register is to be of real value, continued improvement has to mean continued improvement in adherence to the requirements of building regulations.  I will go back, for example, to the areas in which we had some of the most significant fire safety defects.  In some of those areas, there are no requirements to have any training or continued improvement because there is no skills requirement at all.  Fire stopping and fire safety works is one clear example.<\/p> <p>  This is one amendment I would really ask the Minister of State to reconsider.

Obviously, people who have the competence, the expertise and the skills in this area presumably will have been employed in the industry before, and will have done previous work with people who will then be getting inspected, so that independence in their role is very important.  We want them to have that expertise and experience and we also want them to have that independence, but that can be somewhat contradictory.  It is not automatic to have both of those because people will gain a lot of experience and skills from working in the industry, and that is going to mean working for commercial bodies and everything else.  However, while they are in this role, they have to be independent and it is very important that this is explicit in the legislation in order that it is achieved.

I think that should be by appointments.

The previous amendments from Deputy &Oacute; Broin proposing that this goes through the Public Appointments Service are very important.  It is also important to say that the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this made recommendations and while there was some movement towards those in the drafting of the Bill, I do not think they were fully taken on board.  I think this is a better structure for the board and it means half of its members will not come from the Construction Industry Federation side.

I will outline my objections to the section and then propose my alternative.  I see no reason the chair of the board should exclusively be any of the four categories stated, namely, a former judge, a practising solicitor, a practising barrister or a registered construction professional.  I do not think a registered construction professional should be the chair of the board full stop.  That makes no sense whatsoever and would create the perception, at best, that the board does not have the level of independence required if the chair is a registered construction professional who is practising in the industry.  With regard to being a practising solicitor or barrister, it is a bit like the list of people on a passport form who were deemed to be of sufficient good standing in the community to be able to sign the form.  I do not know if those lists are still on the forms but barristers and solicitors were on them.  These could be solicitors or barristers who have no knowledge of the areas in question.  It is likewise for a judge.  I do not understand why, given the particular functions of the chair of a board, it would be restricted to that group of people.  That is the first problem I have with this section.<\/p> <p>  Second, 15 is a large board for a register.  This is not a corporation or a body that has huge functions.  It has very limited and narrow scope and that is one of the weaknesses of the register.  Fifteen is too large a number.  Ten would seem much more appropriate for it to conduct its functions very efficiently.  There are five appointees by the Minister and five persons who are nominated for such appointment by the registration body, of whom at least two are registered construction professionals.  Why should the registration body be able to appoint a third of the board and why should two be practising professionals?<\/p> <p>  What I am proposing is basically a complete replacement of this section.  We have already dealt with my alternative amendment for the chair of the board so I will not return to that but I think ten is an appropriate number.  I know the Minister of State will not accept this proposal but I ask him to deliberate a little on it.  In order to ensure we have the right range of people with the right skills, we need a combination of the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and nominating bodies.  It would be a little like what happens currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There would be ten nominating bodies, which could nominate one, two, three four or five people as they saw fit.  Those people would then have to go through the Public Appointments Service to be interviewed and approved in that manner.<\/p> <p>  The reason I have listed the organisations here is that there is clearly a strong argument for the inclusion of the relevant Departments, including those of the Minister of State and his counterparts.  It is logical for the National Building Control Office to nominate a person or persons who would then go through the PAS.  It is reasonable for both the employers and the trade unions to have nominating rights.  There is also a role for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland and the Irish Planning Institute, and I have also included the Construction Defects Alliance, which is the representative body for homeowners affected by Celtic tiger era defects.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has appointed that organisation to the working group on building defects, which was a very positive move.  That was not done for the previous working group on defective blocks or pyrite.  This amendment does two things.  It makes sure that Departments, professional bodies and affected homeowners have a pathway to membership on the board but there is also the robust mechanism of the Public Appointments Service to ensure they are fully qualified and are the best people for the job.  The board would then have the merit of being a more representative, more qualified and more skilled body, as verified by PAS.  It would also be slightly smaller and streamlined.  In the current section 22, there is an in-built majority on the board, whereas this would have a much more independent flavour to it.  The Government is saying it wants to achieve that independence and my amendments facilitate that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#O00200","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":850,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin's assessment of the approach that has been taken in the Bill is spot-on.

I want to notify the committee of that.  I am particularly interested in whether the Minister of State believes there should be a form of statutory entitlement for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to be represented on the board, for the reasons Deputy O'Callaghan pointed out.  It is Ireland's largest civil society organisation North and South and is organised on a 32-county basis.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is very active, especially in the last few years, on the question of housing and the right to housing.  I know from my own work over the years, including legislative and representational work, and my involvement with the trade union movement, that nobody is more skilled at identifying issues than those who actually work in the sector professionally, such as skilled craftspeople, general operatives and others.  There is genuinely a function here for that expertise in the first instance.  Given how significant housing is to our society more broadly and the construction sector more generally, there is also a function here for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I hope the Minister of State will concede that.

I do not see where special circumstances is listed or prescribed.  Who gets to decide what those special circumstances are?  Given that we are talking about what are potentially very significant allegations against somebody's professional conduct or compliance with the terms of the register, I would have thought that these appeals always being in public would have been the most obvious thing for both parties.  Say someone was appealing in good faith because they thought that they had been wrongly determined initially, I would have thought that they would want the opportunity to do so in public.

One of the big issues with all of the problems we have had with building defects has been the lack latent defects insurance.  It is not the entire solution to the problems but is one of them.

No one will insure them if they keep making mistakes for which they have to pay out.  It is quite an effective method of getting some of the people who have been causing havoc out of the system altogether, as they should be.

In terms of the establishment of the register, the Minister of State might clarify if we are talking about the establishment of the statutory register as provided for in this Bill and that, therefore, a person applying for registration with the board has to provide only information about any conviction in the State.  It is worth pointing out that these are not general convictions but convictions specified in the Bill in regard to building controls, building regulations and fire safety, which are particularly relevant in the context of whether someone is suitable to be on the register.  As I said, these people have only to provide the information.  The fact that they have these convictions, which are potentially very serious convictions, does not mean they are barred from going on the register.  <\/p><p> My reading of the current wording is that as this provision will apply only since the establishment of the register, a person with serious convictions that are highly relevant to building control and fire safety but which date from two years ago will not have to provide that information with an application for registration.  Ten years after the establishment of the register on a statutory basis, the person will have a ten-year window to do that.  I understand the idea of cut-off points but this is highly relevant information.  Bearing in mind that as convictions under the Building Control Acts are very rare, it is highly relevant information.  If there have been convictions under these Acts, I do not see why there would be any time cut-off.  If the Minister of State is strongly of the view that it needs to be ten years, it should, at least, be ten years and not \"or since the establishment of the register\" given that will mean from day one a zero time period.  <\/p><p> As I said, there have been very few convictions under these Acts in any event.

In the Minister of State's deliberations on the matter between now and Report Stage there are two issues to consider.  In planning law, planning authorities can take into account certain forms of past behaviour, whether it is a failure to comply with terms of planning permissions or a failure to complete planning conditions.  It does not apply to building control - we have separate legislation to achieve that - but there is an element of retrospectivity in making future planning decisions.  Likewise with procurement law there has been an interesting discussion in another committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to determine whether past breaches of building controls or of planning could be worked into conditions for future tendering in regard to procurement for public contracts.  It was suggested by a Minister in the previous Government that this might not be legally possible but other European jurisdictions do it.  As long as the rules apply to everybody in the same way, there is no legal question.  These types of provisions, when crafted properly, in certain circumstances can be applied retrospectively.  I urge the Minister of State to look at those examples, as well as what has been said by Deputy Cian O'Callaghan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#R01000","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646265600,"counter":917,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":918,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 31:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 36, lines 26 and 27, to delete &quot;, within the last 10 years or since the establishment of the register whichever is the shorter period,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#R01200","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646265600,"counter":919,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":920,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 32:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 36, lines 35 and 36, to delete &quot;, within the last 10 years or since the establishment of the register whichever is the shorter period,&quot;.  <\/blockquote>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#R01400","speaker":"1550"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646265600,"counter":921,"content":"<p>Amendment put and declared lost.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646265600,"counter":922,"content":"<p>Question, \"That section 34 stand part of the Bill\", put and declared carried.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1646265600,"counter":923,"content":"<p>SECTION 35<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":924,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#R01800","speaker":"1626"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":925,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 33:<\/p> <blockquote> \tIn page 37, line 24, to delete &quot;90 days&quot; and substitute &quot;20 days&quot;.  <\/blockquote> <p>Sections 35 and 37 deal with the decisions on an application for registration and a renewal of registration.

I understand the intention of the Bill, and the complaints section deals with complaints with respect to the specific requirements of the registration process and register.  The officials very helpfully explained some of that to me after Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, for which I thank them.  However, I want to make the case that the grounds upon which a complaint can be made should extend beyond the pure formalities of the registration requirements.<\/p><p>It seems that in the drafting of the Bill, there was an attempt to separate the registration process and the criteria required to comply with that and building control.  The argument could be made that if somebody has a problem with a failure to comply with building regulations, he or she should raise the matter with the building control authority, which is the local authority or the National Building Control Office, or take the matter to the courts.  The problem, which we know from extensive experience, is that neither of those options provide any meaningful remedy for which a person who is affected by, for example, a failure to comply with building control regulations, as per my first amendment, or failure to comply with planning permission, can seek adequate redress even in the limited form of having somebody struck off the register.  It is virtually impossible for a homeowner affected by building defects to take a case to court and win.  Both Deputy Cian O'Callaghan and I have a significant amount of experience of working with homeowners who have been in that situation.  Unless a person has very deep pockets and a significant taste for gambling, the courts do not provide an effective remedy.<\/p><p>Likewise, for the building control authority to seek a remedy through building control enforcement is equally as lengthy and cumbersome.  Somebody might say why do we not reform those two processes and that is the way to do it.  I fully agree with that but when it comes to defective buildings, a belt and braces approach is the right approach.  Therefore, if a company, individual contractor or professional is on this register and is in clear breach of building control regulations, the person affected by that should be able to make a formal complaint on the grounds of breaches of building control regulations.  The consequence of that, were the person successful through the various processes provided for, would be to have somebody struck off the register.  For example, the developer who was responsible for Priory Hall is back in the building game, albeit in the North of our country.  There is nothing stopping that individual from coming to the South, setting up a new company and engaging in construction work activities.  There is nothing in the Building Control Acts that ensures the individual is prevented from practising as a construction industry professional.  They can be struck off a company's board of directors or placed in insolvency or all sorts of other things.<\/p><p>We need to send out a clear signal that the value of this register is not only that individuals have to comply with the terms and conditions of the register but that they could be struck off and prevented from ever practising again if they are in breach of building control regulations and if the complaints process finds that to be the case.  That would be a powerful signal to the industry.  This is not just about complying with the paperwork.  This is not just about complying with the registration requirements; it is about complying with the law.  Today, there is nothing that allows any court in this country, as far as I am aware, to strike a construction industry professional off the register and put him or her out of business.  We have an opportunity to do so and I urge the Minister of State to consider widening the scope of the Bill.  I realise what I am proposing is outside the scope of what was originally intended.  I understand that better now following the conversation I had with the officials.  However, if we let this opportunity pass, we as an Oireachtas will not be forgiven for not having a very effective remedy to ensure a person or company that has built defective buildings in the past can be prevented from building another building or construction project in the future.  That is a deterrent that would start to clean up those elements of the industry that have been in the past and, unfortunately, in small instances in the present, responsible for shoddy work.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPS2022030300002#S00900","speaker":"1468"},{"type":"speech","time":1646265600,"counter":945,"content":"<p>I support what Deputy &Oacute; Broin is proposing.  This would be very effective and would have knock-on effects.  This morning in the D&aacute;il, we raised a different issue on exploitative practices that affect some renters with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The Minister indicated that he would bring in measures whereby landlords engaged in such abhorrent behaviour could be struck off the register for landlords and, therefore, would not be able to practise as a landlord anymore.  That is one of the measures under consideration.  This is very different but it is also a serious issue.  Building defects have caused absolute devastation in people's lives, as well as the significant cost borne publicly as a result.  It is entirely appropriate that there should be a fallout from that.  We are not talking about minor mistakes or where there are learnings to be made.  That is quite different.  However, for very serious building defects that have devastating consequences, of course, a fallout from that should be that the individual responsible should not be able to build again and repeat those mistakes.<\/p> <p>  It is important for the homeowners to get a sense of justice, while they have gone through the stress of seeing their homes fall apart or have been worried about their kids falling asleep in a building that is not fire-safety compliant, there is the possibility of individuals or contractors not being able to build again because they cannot get on this register, if they are found to have failed to comply with building control regulations.  As we all know, the threshold to achieve that can be quite high and difficult for residents and homeowners to get to.<\/p><p>It is worthy of very serious consideration.
